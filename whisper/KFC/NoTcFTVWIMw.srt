1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,840
 We are almost finished our current series on equipping the saints and serving the community.

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,280
 And we started off together, literally together.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:24,680
 The first sermon was with Pastor Seth and talking about unity.

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:32,540
 And did a great job talking about why we need to be as a body of Christ, working together.

5
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,760
 And then we had a sermon on being prepared.

6
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:43,640
 How Jesus himself was prepared in the desert through the three temptations.

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,480
 Last week Pastor John talked to us about being equipped.

8
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,280
 He talked about ways that we are equipped.

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,400
 The first is the how, then it's the why and it's the where.

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,080
 Holy Spirit equips each one of us in the body of Christ with different gifts.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,440
 He equips us so that we can build up the body of Christ together so that the kingdom of

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,560
 heaven will be built up.

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,440
 So together, prepared, equipped.

14
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:24,600
 And finally today we are talking about witness.

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,760
 Has anybody been to Cleveland before?

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,180
 Now I've heard weird things about Cleveland.

17
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:38,000
 It's not very pretty, but there's one really quite famous thing in the city of Cleveland.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,940
 When he was playing there, there was this really huge poster there or banner, whatever

19
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,940
 you call it.

20
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,240
 Let's show it there.

21
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,480
 It's LeBron James, we are all witnesses.

22
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,720
 And Nike came up with this commercial, we are all witnesses.

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,080
 What are we witnessing?

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,320
 LeBron James.

25
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,760
 And it's been 20 years that he's been playing.

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,720
 Man, these old guys are playing so well, right?

27
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,160
 Tom Brady just retired.

28
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,960
 You know, Nadal is still going, sort of.

29
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,680
 Djokovic is still going.

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,160
 All these guys, so old.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,840
 Well, not old, a little bit younger than some of us, mature, but still going.

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,640
 Old in terms of athletic age, but still going.

33
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,200
 LeBron James, 38 years old, still going, still MVP, still getting the most votes in the NBA.

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,120
 Amazing how he has kept his body just in prime condition.

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,960
 We are witnessing these great athletes.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,040
 And Jesus also tells us that we need to witness.

37
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,240
 What is a witness?

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:58,920
 Well, according to some internet definitions, a witness is a person who sees an event happening,

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,120
 especially a crime or an accident, and he testifies to it, right?

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,120
 So in court, somebody is a witness, comes up and testify what he or she has heard or

41
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
 seen.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,600
 He is a witness.

43
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:18,880
 And we see continuously in the scriptures that Jesus tells us that we need to be witnesses.

44
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,600
 And so we see this, firstly, when Jesus says the Great Commission.

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,960
 Let's read together, all authority, one, two, three.

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:33,000
 All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,360
 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,

48
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,880
 of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you.

49
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,120
 And surely I'm with you always to the very end of the age.

50
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,760
 Jesus says, all authority has been given to me, so go and make disciples.

51
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,040
 Go and share the message that I have taught you.

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,120
 Go and make disciples how I have made a disciple out of you.

53
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,840
 And when Jesus died and rose again, before he was going to be raised, he told us in Acts,

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,640
 let's read together in the book of Acts, one, two, three, that you will receive power when

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:25,560
 the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea,

56
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,520
 in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,880
 Jesus is saying the Holy Spirit will come.

58
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
 And when that happens, you will be my witnesses.

59
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:46,400
 You will tell of the things you have learned, seen, experienced, and you will be my witnesses,

60
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:55,040
 not only in your city, Jerusalem, but in your neighboring province in Judea, to foreign

61
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:03,640
 sort of regions in Samaria, and then to the ends of the earth, to the ends of the earth.

62
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:11,240
 And in 1 Peter, it also says this, but in your hearts, revere Christ as Lord.

63
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,040
 Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope

64
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
 that you have.

65
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,880
 But do this with gentleness and respect.

66
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:34,120
 Be prepared in season, out of season, to share what the Lord has done for you.

67
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,160
 And we're going to learn about witness today, and the best person that we can learn from

68
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,400
 is Jesus himself.

69
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,840
 And so we're going to see a quick video on this.

70
00:05:46,840 --> 00:06:00,680
 Would you give me a drink?

71
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,520
 Did you hear me?

72
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
 That's bad, huh?

73
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,960
 What?

74
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:17,040
 You would you ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan, and a woman?

75
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,960
 I'm sorry.

76
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,960
 I should have said please.

77
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,560
 You know, it's not safe for you to be alone out here.

78
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
 Nor you.

79
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,240
 Why haven't you come with others?

80
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,440
 Why so late in the day?

81
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,440
 Don't women come to the wells in the cool of the morning?

82
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,320
 Yeah, well, none of them will be seen with me, so I have to come out now.

83
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,000
 In the heat, as you have so kindly reminded me.

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,400
 Why won't they be seen with you?

85
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
 Long story.

86
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,400
 I'd still like a drink of water, if you can spare it.

87
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,960
 You've seen what a parched throat will do.

88
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,920
 Aren't I unclean to you?

89
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,120
 Won't you be defiled by this vessel?

90
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,240
 Maybe some of my people say that about your women, but I don't.

91
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
 Yeah?

92
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,960
 And what do you say?

93
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,960
 I say if you knew who I am, you'd be asking me for a drink.

94
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
 Really?

95
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
 And I would give you living water.

96
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,560
 Would, except that you have nothing to draw water with, and this is a deep well.

97
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,480
 Besides, what do you need from me if you have your own supply of living water?

98
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
 Long story.

99
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,040
 Your water is better than Samaritan water.

100
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
 That's not what I said.

101
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,120
 Are you a better man than our ancestor Jacob, who dug this well?

102
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
 Your water is better than his?

103
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,360
 I know Jacob, and everyone who drinks this water will thirst again.

104
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,400
 But whoever drinks the water that I give him will never be thirsty again.

105
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,760
 Wouldn't that be nice?

106
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:06,760
 The water I give will become in a person a spring of water, welling up to eternal life.

107
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,760
 Really?

108
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,760
 Yes, really.

109
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,760
 Prove it.

110
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:18,120
 First, go and call your husband and come back.

111
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
 I will show you both.

112
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
 I don't have a husband.

113
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,120
 You are right.

114
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,400
 You've had five husbands.

115
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,040
 And the man you're living with now is not your husband.

116
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,440
 I see.

117
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,840
 You're a prophet.

118
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
 You're here to preach at me.

119
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
 No.

120
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,760
 Usually the one good thing about coming here alone is I can escape being condemned.

121
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,920
 I'm not here to condemn you.

122
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
 I've made mistakes.

123
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
 Too many.

124
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,440
 But it's men like you who have made it impossible for me to do anything about it.

125
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
 How?

126
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
 My ancestors worshipped on this mountain.

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,160
 But you Jews insist Jerusalem is the only place for true worship.

128
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,040
 They say that because the temple is there.

129
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
 Yeah.

130
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,320
 Exactly where we're not allowed.

131
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,600
 I'm here to break those barriers.

132
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,200
 And the time is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship

133
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
 the Father.

134
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,080
 So where am I supposed to go when I need God?

135
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,520
 I've never received anything from God, but I couldn't thank him even if I did.

136
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,960
 Anywhere.

137
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,960
 God is spirit.

138
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:33,800
 And the time is coming and is now here that it won't matter where you worship, but only

139
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,000
 that you do it in spirit and truth.

140
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Heart and mind.

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,600
 That, that is the kind of worshipper he's looking for.

142
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:59,800
 It won't matter where you're from or what you've done.

143
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,960
 That clip was taken from The Chosen.

144
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,040
 And anybody been watching The Chosen?

145
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,700
 It's a new sort of film or TV series about Jesus.

146
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,680
 And it sort of uses sort of the message, you know, translation sort of version to modernize

147
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,240
 what they could have had a conversation about.

148
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,280
 And so here we see Jesus and the Samaritan woman.

149
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,920
 And Jesus had so many difficulties in relating with this woman.

150
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,600
 Firstly, Jesus was a Jew.

151
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,020
 And we see in the video, why are you talking with me?

152
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,020
 You are a Jew.

153
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,060
 I'm a Samaritan woman.

154
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:53,540
 There were cultural barriers between Jews and Gentiles.

155
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:03,700
 We'll see in the map next slide that Samaria was in the middle, right?

156
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:10,180
 And Jesus is in Judea in the bottom part, and he's going to Galilee.

157
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:17,220
 And the Jews disliked the Samaritans so much that they would actually cross over to the

158
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,380
 Jordan River to not go through Samaria.

159
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,980
 And that's because Samaritans were considered half-breeds, unclean.

160
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,100
 You remember in the video, you want a drink of water from me?

161
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,420
 A Samaritan?

162
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,940
 Isn't our water not as good as your water?

163
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
 It's in it unclean.

164
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,540
 My vessel is unclean.

165
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,100
 The Samaritans were considered half-breeds.

166
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:52,380
 When the Assyrians came and overtook the Jews, they intermingled, interbred with some of

167
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,860
 the Jews.

168
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,620
 And those became the Samaritans.

169
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:07,900
 And so the Jews and the Samaritans had cultural differences, and that became a barrier for

170
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,740
 them to talk.

171
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,680
 And also, Jesus was a man, right?

172
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,940
 And so not just any man, he was a righteous man, considered a prophet.

173
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,700
 And she, as you see in the video, she was considered sort of an outcast.

174
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,300
 She went to the well at noon.

175
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,400
 Why did she go to the well at noon?

176
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,540
 To be alone.

177
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,580
 Possibly because she didn't want to be with anybody.

178
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,080
 Maybe she was the talk of the town because she had five husbands.

179
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:45,420
 She had five husbands.

180
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,300
 And there was also a religious difference.

181
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,700
 The Jews thought that they worshipped in the proper area, the right place.

182
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,620
 And where was that?

183
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,220
 Jerusalem.

184
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:04,940
 And you see in the next slide that the Samaritans worshipped on Mount Gerizim, right?

185
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:15,020
 That was where their ancestors worshipped in the Old Testament.

186
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,980
 As it says, that you will worship me when you leave on Mount Gerizim.

187
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:29,620
 And so there were differences, cultural differences, gender differences, social differences, religious

188
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,740
 differences.

189
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,700
 And yet Jesus chose to connect with this woman.

190
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,520
 And so we're going to learn five ways we can witness like Jesus.

191
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,840
 On a scale of one to 10, how easy was it for Jesus to connect with this woman?

192
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,580
 It was super hard, right?

193
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:59,100
 Sometimes there are super easy people, right, that are so willing to know more about God,

194
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,100
 right?

195
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,620
 And those people, you just share the gospel with them and they come to know Jesus.

196
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,380
 But this one, between Jesus and the Samaritan woman, it's one of the hardest because of

197
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,560
 all these barriers.

198
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:19,600
 And we're going to learn five ways to witness like Jesus.

199
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,360
 And first is choose, choose.

200
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:31,800
 Jesus chose especially to have a divine appointment with this woman.

201
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:39,520
 Jesus could have went around Samaria like most Jews, but he chose to meet this woman

202
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,160
 directly.

203
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:50,280
 And we also, in order for us to witness like Jesus, we need to choose to see the people

204
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,880
 around us.

205
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,080
 Choose to meet with the people around us.

206
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:06,040
 Choose to get to know the people around us, to see that they also need the Lord.

207
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,000
 We need to choose.

208
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,240
 In your sphere of relationships, right, you can have your family as the closest, you know,

209
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,240
 best friends.

210
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,720
 And then you have sort of your friends, right?

211
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,120
 Maybe not Facebook friends.

212
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,560
 Are they real friends?

213
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,320
 Okay, friends.

214
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,600
 And then Facebook friends.

215
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,600
 And then acquaintances, people you just say hi and bye to.

216
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,640
 And then after that, you know, coworkers, right?

217
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,280
 Or coworkers or acquaintances, something like that, or friends, they become friends as well.

218
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:43,840
 But in our sphere of relationships, do we choose to be intentional?

219
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,680
 Jesus is intentional with this woman.

220
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,800
 He wanted to meet with her personally.

221
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:02,720
 In our sphere of relationships, in the family, relatives, close friends, friends, acquaintances,

222
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:12,280
 coworkers, are we choosing to be intentional with our relationships?

223
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:18,360
 The second thing is to witness like Jesus, we need to connect with people.

224
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
 Connect.

225
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,800
 How did Jesus connect with this woman?

226
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,400
 Water.

227
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,200
 Can I have a drink?

228
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,240
 Right?

229
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,720
 And then he mentions it again.

230
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,400
 If you want water, if you know who is asking you for water, you would have asked me for

231
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,840
 water and I would have given you living water.

232
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,480
 Right?

233
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,160
 Jesus answered her, if you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink,

234
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:57,360
 you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.

235
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,560
 The woman was drawing water.

236
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,480
 Jesus asked for water.

237
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,720
 The Samaritan was like, why are you asking me for water?

238
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,240
 Jesus is like, do you know who is asking you for water?

239
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,800
 This water theme comes up continually.

240
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:25,200
 And if we are to witness to our friends, family, relatives, coworkers, acquaintances, we need

241
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
 to connect with them.

242
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,800
 And so how do you connect with them?

243
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,680
 Maybe you go rock climbing together.

244
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,160
 Maybe you go playing tennis together.

245
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,560
 Maybe you...

246
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,320
 It's a sensitive topic in the church, you know.

247
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,160
 Play games, board games together.

248
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,000
 Play games together.

249
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,480
 Have dinner together.

250
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,000
 Play basketball together.

251
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,920
 Go watch some movies together.

252
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,520
 You need to connect with people.

253
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,720
 Jesus connected with this woman.

254
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,120
 We need to also connect with our friends and our family.

255
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,400
 And it's not that hard.

256
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,400
 You just need to find things that you commonly like.

257
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
 What do you like?

258
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,440
 Oh, I like to eat.

259
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,160
 Who likes to eat?

260
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,080
 Well then we can connect.

261
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
 Let's connect.

262
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,880
 Right?

263
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,640
 If you like specific foods, then you can go and connect together, eat together.

264
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,040
 And through that, you can build trust.

265
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,160
 So choose to be intentional.

266
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:43,360
 You need to connect through some sort of common interest or theme or something you like.

267
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,760
 And then the next thing we need to start doing is we need to care.

268
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,240
 What do we need to care for?

269
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,040
 What did Jesus care about?

270
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,480
 Jesus cared about her spiritual background.

271
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,520
 She pointed out specifically, "Oh, you worship.

272
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,720
 You Jews worship there.

273
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,760
 We worship here.

274
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,680
 We're not allowed in Jerusalem because we're considered unclean."

275
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:19,440
 And then Jesus responds again, right, and says that, "You will neither worship here

276
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,880
 or there, but one day you'll worship in spirit and in truth.

277
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,600
 And that time is now."

278
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:37,560
 As we connect with our friends, we can start to care more about them, care for them.

279
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,040
 Have you tried connecting with your friends and seeing what their spiritual background

280
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,760
 is?

281
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:52,320
 Whether they believe in God or not, whether they go to church or not.

282
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:59,640
 Maybe they've been to church in the past, but now how do they feel about church?

283
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,760
 Maybe they have a bad experience at church and you can care for them.

284
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,920
 How come you had a bad experience?

285
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,360
 How can I help you make...

286
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:16,960
 Find what you went through, spiritual background.

287
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,480
 And eventually we need to care about their spiritual need.

288
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,920
 Every one of us has a need.

289
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,360
 What was the woman's need?

290
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,920
 So she was dancing around, playing with water.

291
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,400
 She was dancing around this religion issue.

292
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,720
 But what was really her need?

293
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,720
 What do you think was her need?

294
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,720
 Shout it out.

295
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
 What do you think was her real need?

296
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,720
 Pardon me?

297
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
 Love?

298
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,280
 Understanding?

299
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,760
 Maybe attention, somebody to actually speak with her?

300
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,720
 Not acceptance?

301
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,880
 She desired relationship.

302
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,640
 She'd been with five husbands.

303
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,480
 She's gone through relationship after relationship after relationship.

304
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:24,660
 Her deepest need was acceptance and relationship, love, all this.

305
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,040
 And she'd been trying through relationship, relationship, relationship, and it's left

306
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,680
 her empty.

307
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:40,800
 And Jesus points her towards a relationship that will last forever.

308
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,400
 And that is a relationship with God, with himself.

309
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:52,240
 And the next thing we need to know is how to be clever.

310
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,000
 Now Jesus, obviously, he's all-knowing, all-powerful.

311
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,560
 He's the smartest person in the world.

312
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,580
 He was clever.

313
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,960
 And when we are witnesses, we ourselves also need to be clever.

314
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:14,080
 We need to be clever because relationships are so sensitive.

315
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,320
 They're so sensitive.

316
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,720
 You can say one thing and destroy the relationship.

317
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,320
 James warned us, "Be careful of your tongue because your tongue is like a flaming fireball."

318
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,460
 Flaming fireball.

319
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,480
 Anything you can say can destroy the relationship.

320
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,280
 We need to be smart.

321
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:42,440
 If we're too pushy, we're going to seem as too pushy, right?

322
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:55,360
 If we're too pushy, then we're going to put off people from Jesus.

323
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,380
 If we keep shoving religion down people's throat, we're going to choke the people, right?

324
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,120
 They're not going to want to know more about Jesus.

325
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,760
 They're going to be turned off about Jesus.

326
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:15,660
 And so what we need to know is to be sensitive to the Spirit's guidance.

327
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:21,540
 There are times where somebody is really ready for the gospel and you just go and share the

328
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:25,780
 gospel with that person and they can come to know Jesus.

329
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:32,740
 But there are times where some people need more time.

330
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:40,780
 Maybe they need to work out some of their spiritual issues, some philosophical, theological

331
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,780
 issues.

332
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,060
 Maybe they don't believe in God yet and we need to work out some of these theological

333
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
 issues with them.

334
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,940
 Maybe they have issues surrounded about morality.

335
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,360
 Why does God allow evil and suffering?

336
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,020
 Maybe they've had some past hurts in the church and they need to experience more of the love

337
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,400
 of God first.

338
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,360
 And so sometimes it requires more time.

339
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,440
 It's like going apple picking.

340
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,540
 Have anybody gone apple picking before?

341
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,540
 Yeah?

342
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,820
 It's quite popular in Toronto, actually.

343
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,660
 You can just go to the apple farm and go pick the fruit.

344
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,500
 And so what do you usually do at the apple farm?

345
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,340
 You go and pick apples and then you eat them.

346
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,100
 Where do you usually pick?

347
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,300
 Where do you usually pick, Anthony?

348
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,180
 Yeah, in an apple tree.

349
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,460
 Which apples do you usually eat?

350
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,220
 So you're looking at a big apple tree.

351
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,620
 Which apples do you usually pick?

352
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,180
 Do you climb up to the top and then pick the ones at the top?

353
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
 No.

354
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
 And then climb down?

355
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,180
 No.

356
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,180
 You pick the easier ones.

357
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,900
 It's easy pickings.

358
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:53,740
 So we need to identify as witnesses what people are ready for the gospel.

359
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,820
 What fruits are ripe for the picking.

360
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,580
 If we're picking Royal Gala apples or Red Delicious, you don't pick the green ones if

361
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,820
 you're Red Delicious.

362
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:11,020
 You pick the red ripe ones, like the color of your chair.

363
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,980
 Because you know they're ripe for the picking.

364
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:20,060
 And in the same way, we need to be sensitive to the Spirit to recognize where our friends

365
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:27,940
 are at spiritually so that we can lead them one step closer to Jesus.

366
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,780
 Our goal is that every time we encounter our friends and our family, that we lead them

367
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,740
 one step closer towards Christ.

368
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,740
 And the fifth thing is Christ.

369
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,780
 If we are friends with our, if we keep playing basketball, if we keep playing board games,

370
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:56,860
 if we keep playing tennis with these people, but we never lead them towards Christ or share

371
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,220
 Christ, we're no different than the world.

372
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,340
 We're no different than the world.

373
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,860
 Actually the world is better at being friends than us.

374
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,140
 The world is, there's some amazing people out there that are caring and loving, but

375
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,940
 they don't know Christ, but they're amazing friends.

376
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:25,460
 The difference for us being witnesses is that eventually people need to see Christ in us,

377
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:32,600
 whether it's through our love, through our actions, and eventually through our words.

378
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:40,700
 We can share our story, how God has changed us, how he has worked in and through our life,

379
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:47,020
 how he has saved us, and share that story with them.

380
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,100
 And so the next slide, you'll see this diagram.

381
00:26:50,100 --> 00:27:01,340
 Yes, our goal as Christians, as witnesses, is that we want to lead our friends, family,

382
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,460
 relatives, coworkers, one step closer towards Jesus Christ.

383
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,140
 Every time we meet them, we're hoping.

384
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:16,380
 So maybe we have friends that are without Christ, and they're so far from Christ, right?

385
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:23,780
 They're like anti-God, they're like anti-church, anti-Christian, but somehow they know you,

386
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,260
 and they like you, and they start eating out with you.

387
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,820
 And so they're here.

388
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:34,140
 And so every time you have dinner with them, hopefully, oh, they see, oh, they're at one,

389
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,300
 and they're, oh, they have dinner with you, and they're, oh, he's not a bad guy, Anthony.

390
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,060
 They become at two.

391
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,180
 And he's like, oh, yeah, he actually cares about me, three, right?

392
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:50,780
 And then they become closer to this point, let's say it's number five, a point where

393
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:58,460
 they're ready to be open towards knowing more about Jesus, and to the point where they're

394
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:04,780
 willing to even enter into a relationship with Jesus, accepting Christ, right?

395
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:09,180
 And once they've accepted Christ, this is where they're at the church, and we keep helping

396
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:17,940
 them to become mature Christians, leading them to know God, and becoming more like God.

397
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:25,540
 And so we see here, in the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman, that Jesus reveals

398
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,300
 himself.

399
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:32,440
 And he says this, actually, let's read John chapter four, 25 to 26.

400
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,000
 The woman said, "I know the Messiah called Christ is coming.

401
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,600
 When he comes, he will explain everything to us.

402
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,760
 Then Jesus declared, 'I, the one speaking to you, I am he.'"

403
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:55,360
 How many times in the New Testament do we see that Jesus so clearly reveals his identity?

404
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,040
 Is it every day on Instagram, he's like, yo, here I am, this is what I'm doing, this is

405
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,360
 who I am, come follow me on Instagram.

406
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,560
 Does he say that?

407
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
 No.

408
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,400
 He's actually very subtle.

409
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,760
 He might probably not have Instagram if he was alive today.

410
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
 He'd be very subtle.

411
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:20,080
 Maybe it was a very private, to 12 disciples, Instagram page, right?

412
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:29,680
 But Jesus chooses to reveal himself, that he is the Christ.

413
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:39,600
 And we as his witnesses, we also need to reveal to our friends and our family, acquaintances,

414
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,000
 that we are followers of Christ.

415
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,440
 We need to choose to connect with our friends and family intentionally.

416
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,160
 We need to connect with them.

417
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,240
 We need to care about them, their spiritual background, their spiritual need.

418
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:02,160
 We need to be clever to understand the timing that God has.

419
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,360
 God has the perfect timing.

420
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:12,200
 And eventually, we need to lead them towards Christ.

421
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,240
 I was playing basketball, obviously.

422
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:22,240
 And I was playing basketball, and I met a friend, I met a guy named Jonah.

423
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,160
 And this was like a year and a half ago, I think.

424
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,440
 And actually, we weren't friends.

425
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,240
 I was friends with his friend, and his friend brought him to play basketball with us.

426
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:40,320
 And I quickly learned more about Jonah, that he actually went to Confucius High School,

427
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,840
 which is actually in Causeway Bay.

428
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,080
 And we started playing ball more and more together.

429
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:55,480
 And I realized that he was actually quite open towards knowing more about spiritual

430
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
 things.

431
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,920
 Actually, he liked Confucianism so much that he took a personal private class every week

432
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,920
 to learn and study Confucius text.

433
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:14,680
 So then I'm like, "Oh, if you're interested in Confucius text, maybe you would be interested

434
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,680
 in learning about the Bible as well."

435
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:26,120
 And so I invited him to start coming to our fellowship on Thursdays.

436
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:34,480
 And so this no-religion kind of person who likes to know more about Confucianism and

437
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,240
 Buddhist texts and Confucius texts started coming to our fellowship regularly.

438
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,320
 And he started coming for several months, actually.

439
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,440
 And he even came to one of our summer camps.

440
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,120
 So I was playing basketball with him one day, and then we had dinner.

441
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,680
 And he was like, "Oh, what are you doing tomorrow?"

442
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,320
 I said, "I'm going to camp.

443
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,520
 I'm going to one of our Explorer camps."

444
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:05,280
 Explorer is the name of our youth program.

445
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,440
 And he's like, "Cool."

446
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,540
 And I'm like, "Do you wanna come?"

447
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,640
 And he's like, "Yeah, sure.

448
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,320
 I'll ask my parents right now."

449
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,480
 So I call Carmen, who is in charge of the camp.

450
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,480
 I was like, "Yo, I have this high school student.

451
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,320
 He wants to come to our youth camp.

452
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,360
 He's non-Christian, and it's awesome.

453
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,360
 It's perfect.

454
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:30,680
 He can come, and this is a camp for an outreach that we've been doing, Chan Bok Sa students."

455
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:36,040
 And so he comes to the camp, and he's been coming to fellowship.

456
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:41,860
 And then one night, after basketball, me and Ken, we were having dinner with him.

457
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,300
 And we just said, "You know, Jonah, you've been learning about Jesus.

458
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,700
 You've been coming to fellowship.

459
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,540
 You came to our camp.

460
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,780
 What do you think about Jesus, honestly?"

461
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,380
 And I shared the gospel with him.

462
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,100
 I drew it out for him.

463
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,140
 You know, the first step, God wants a relationship with us.

464
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,140
 The problem is sin.

465
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:07,700
 Jesus is the solution to sin.

466
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,180
 And what do you think about it?

467
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:17,660
 And he's like, "I really think that God is real, and I really want to know him more.

468
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:24,780
 And I'm willing to ask him into my life to be my Lord and Savior."

469
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,980
 And the next slide, you'll see this photo.

470
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,300
 I wrote it out here.

471
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:36,580
 Jonah accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior on November 20th, 2021.

472
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,020
 And the witnesses were me and Ken.

473
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:46,980
 And this was six months of getting to know Jonah, connecting with him, choosing to be

474
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:53,580
 intentional, caring about him, his spiritual background, caring about what his spiritual

475
00:33:53,580 --> 00:34:02,780
 need was, and eventually leading him towards Christ himself.

476
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:09,000
 When you encounter Christ, your life will change.

477
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,060
 And Jonah has moved to the UK, and we still keep up.

478
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:19,600
 We still call on a regular basis, and we do some discipleship and read the Bible together.

479
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,140
 And he's actually recently telling me, "Oh, I'm starting to serve more in church.

480
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,540
 I'm starting to play the piano and join the worship team."

481
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:35,020
 And he goes to a church regularly and a youth group, a university group regularly.

482
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:43,000
 And it's amazing to see how this person, who grew up with a Confucius background, Confucius

483
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,120
 high school background, has come to know Jesus.

484
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,800
 And we can be witnesses, not just me as a witness.

485
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,880
 You can be witnesses for Jesus as well.

486
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:02,520
 It doesn't mean you have to take a 12-step program to know how to share the gospel.

487
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,940
 You can share the gospel.

488
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,360
 You can be a witness.

489
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:10,600
 And we see this from the Samaritan woman herself.

490
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
 Let's read together.

491
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,400
 John 4, verse 28 to 30.

492
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,480
 "Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, 'Come,

493
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,900
 see a man who told me everything I ever did.

494
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,920
 Could this be the Messiah?'

495
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,760
 They came out from the town and made their way toward him."

496
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,960
 And actually, in the next couple verses, it says, "Many people came to know and accept

497
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,440
 Jesus as the Messiah on account of the testimony from this woman."

498
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,760
 This woman just got to know Jesus.

499
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,240
 She didn't even go through Alpha or 101 or 102 or 103.

500
00:35:53,240 --> 00:36:00,420
 But what she did, she knew who Jesus was, and that encounter changed her life.

501
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,560
 And what did she do?

502
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,960
 She couldn't help but go back into her town and tell people, "This is a person who told

503
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,840
 me everything I ever did.

504
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,980
 Could this be God?

505
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:17,680
 Could this be the Messiah, the person, the Savior that we've been longing for?"

506
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,120
 And just like this woman, we can be witnesses.

507
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:26,520
 Tell the person beside you, you can be a witness for Jesus.

508
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,480
 Tell them enthusiastically.

509
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,200
 You can be a witness for Jesus.

510
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,840
 When you encounter Christ, your life will change.

511
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:52,520
 As you see in the next slide, when you encounter Christ, your life will change.

512
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:59,200
 The Samaritan woman encountered Jesus Christ, and because of that, her life was changed.

513
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:06,560
 And out of that relationship, there was an overflowing, outpouring of this desire to

514
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,800
 witness, to talk about what Jesus had done.

515
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,040
 Today, will you be a witness?

516
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,560
 Will you be a witness?

517
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:35,040
 As the band comes up, I want us to just close our eyes and think about the circle of friends

518
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,320
 that God has placed in your life, the circle of relationships that God has placed in your

519
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:47,520
 life.

520
00:37:47,520 --> 00:38:08,200
 Is there one or two names that God is speaking to you about these one or two or three people?

521
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:20,280
 That he's asking you to choose to be intentional with, to care about them, to connect with

522
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:27,620
 them, and lead them eventually towards Christ.

523
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:39,460
 Is there one or two names that Jesus is speaking to you?

524
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:46,740
 Let's just take a moment to intentionally start praying for these one or two people

525
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:56,780
 that God has placed in your heart, that he's asking you to witness to.

526
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,580
 Maybe it's a family member.

527
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,740
 Maybe it's a friend, a long-time friend.

528
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,740
 Maybe it's a co-worker.

529
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:13,460
 Let's spend some time.

530
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:31,060
 Who is Jesus asking you to witness to today?

531
00:39:31,060 --> 00:40:01,020
 Heavenly Father, we place these people that

532
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:11,020
 you've put into our lives into your hands.

533
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:19,020
 We ask that, Lord, you would guide us by your Holy Spirit to be intentional, to choose to

534
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:30,900
 be intentional, to connect with these people, that we could care about them.

535
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,980
 Care about their spiritual background.

536
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,020
 Care about their needs.

537
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,420
 Give us wisdom.

538
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:46,680
 Guide us by your Spirit to know the timing, the right timing, that we can lead them one

539
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,940
 step closer to Christ.

540
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,420
 In Jesus' name we pray.

541
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,020
 Amen.

542
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,600
 (upbeat music)
