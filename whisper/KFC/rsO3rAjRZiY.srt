00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,060
 Good evening everyone and welcome to, oh thank you, and welcome to KFCI.

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,600
 My name is Bonnie and for those of you who don't know me, I work as the ministry's assistant

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,320
 here at Kampfolk Church International.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,720
 As a special one-off series, special one-off sermon actually, addition to our six-week

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:35,440
 sermon series on Acts 22, 42 to 47, Church Together, which Pastor John wrapped up for

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:44,040
 us last week, I'm inviting you to join me as we head back into the basics.

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,440
 Tonight we'll be building on the foundation that Pastor John, Johnny, James, and Michelle

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,880
 have built for us as we look at what it means to belong to the church and to be part of

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,280
 the body of Christ.

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:06,600
 The community, body, and family of Christ is a topic that's close to my heart and I

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,360
 hope that I can do it justice.

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,200
 So as I was preparing for this sermon, I actually was reminded about this recent conversation

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,680
 I had had with a friend who's new to the Christian faith.

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,960
 After some disappointing experiences with his local church, he shared with me that he

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:38,680
 felt he couldn't find spiritual home with this particular body of believers or see himself

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,220
 walking alongside them to support one another on their faith journeys.

17
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:53,560
 And he came to me with this question, "Is it really necessary to be part of a local

18
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,380
 church?

19
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:04,240
 Isn't my faith journey more about the personal relationship between me and Jesus?

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,920
 Why do I need church?"

21
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,800
 The answer that I gave him was honestly far from satisfactory even for myself.

22
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:26,680
 I was ashamed to admit that as a former religious kid, as someone who grew up in the church,

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,280
 albeit kicking and screaming, "I'm so sorry, Mama, who's here tonight," I had never questioned

24
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,400
 the necessity of being part of the local church.

25
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,080
 It's simply something that you do when you come back to faith.

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,800
 As a new believer, you join yourself to a local church and ensure that you're walking

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,880
 with like-minded brothers and sisters in Christ to support one another on your faith journeys.

28
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:59,800
 It was what I did when I came back to the faith, and I've never questioned it since.

29
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:08,600
 Now that is part of it, a look at the Apostle Paul's very complicated church story actually

30
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,000
 might give us more insight.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,440
 Though the Apostle Paul, or Saul, grew up as a religious kid, he didn't grow into love

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,160
 for Christ's church.

33
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,240
 Instead, he kicked against it.

34
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:31,720
 As Author Megan Hill, in her book, A Place to Belong, Learning to Love the Local Church,

35
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,760
 writes, "Paul hated the church, celebrated the death of her first martyr, and used all

36
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,440
 his energies to strike down Christ's beloved people wherever he could find them."

37
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:54,640
 As Paul was traveling to Damascus, breathing out murderous threats against Christ's people,

38
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:06,440
 as scripture puts it, he encountered Jesus, and the direction of his life was forever

39
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,000
 changed.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Overnight, the church's enemy became the church's friend.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Although, as Hill writes, we might expect Paul's story to be all sunshine and hymnsong

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,440
 from that moment on, Neo-Church member Paul actually went on to experience many of the

43
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,320
 challenges of life in the local church.

44
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,840
 I won't list the challenges, misunderstandings, and disappointments Paul faced here in full,

45
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:49,960
 but if there was anyone who knew how disappointing the local church can be, it was the Apostle

46
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,920
 Paul.

47
00:04:52,920 --> 00:05:04,360
 And yet, as Hill writes, this is the same Paul who goes on to call the church "beloved"

48
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:10,080
 at least a dozen times in his letters.

49
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,640
 This is the same Paul who regularly refers to other Christians as "brothers and sisters."

50
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:25,600
 This is the same Paul whose writings overflow with tender mentions of particular Christians,

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:34,280
 with longing to be face-to-face with the churches, with both anxiety but affection for them,

52
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:41,000
 and with unflagging optimism for their future glorification.

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,400
 Paul's story leads brilliantly into my first point, that to be part of the local church

54
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,200
 is to be loved by God.

55
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:00,840
 Our experience of joining and being part of the local church first starts with our experience

56
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,840
 of being loved by God.

57
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,640
 We see this in Paul's story.

58
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:14,960
 Before joining a local church and before becoming part of the body and family of Christ, Saul

59
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,080
 first had to discover that he was loved by God.

60
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,600
 How?

61
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:32,360
 Well, as Saul was confronted on the road to Damascus by Jesus about Saul's persecution

62
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:44,640
 of the church, Jesus chooses not to seek revenge against Saul for these murderous acts that

63
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,800
 he has committed against the church.

64
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:55,040
 While Jesus does strike him blind temporarily, he also tells Saul that he will rescue him

65
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,920
 from his own people and from the Gentiles.

66
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:09,440
 In fact, we see in Acts 26, verses 17-18, that Jesus tells Saul he is sending him to

67
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,600
 the Gentiles to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power

68
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:24,080
 of Satan to God so that they might receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those

69
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,760
 sanctified by faith in him.

70
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:35,520
 Here we see Jesus acting not just out of love for his people, the people who already know

71
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,520
 love and follow him, but also for Saul and for the Gentiles, these people who have not

72
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:50,000
 yet heard the good news about his death and resurrection on the cross.

73
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,640
 And in this act of mercy that Jesus performs, we see this truth.

74
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,000
 God loves his people.

75
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,320
 Now those of us who are familiar with the Bible and the story that it presents know

76
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:14,400
 that God's love for his people didn't start with the local church or even with the establishment

77
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,920
 of the New Testament church in the book of Acts.

78
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,380
 God's love for his people is eternal.

79
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:35,200
 The Lord himself declares to the prophet Jeremiah that he has loved us with an everlasting love.

80
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,840
 God who is himself love, determined to love others and the whole of the biblical story

81
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:52,200
 consists exactly of the story of God making his love visible.

82
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,560
 But there are many instances where we can point towards God's love in the Bible, such

83
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:05,360
 as his rescue of his people from slavery in Egypt and from exile in Babylon.

84
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,180
 Perhaps the greatest act of love that God performs is in the climax of the biblical

85
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,260
 story where God sends his beloved son.

86
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,840
 And we read in John 3.16, I'm sure many of you here know this verse, it is one of the

87
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:34,120
 most famous in the church, that God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son

88
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:42,160
 that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

89
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,240
 John writes of Jesus himself that he loved his own who were in the world and he loved

90
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,920
 them to the end, all the way to the cross.

91
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,400
 And Jesus' act of love and mercy only grows stronger when you realize that before we had

92
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:08,640
 come to saving faith in Christ Jesus, we were dead in our sins.

93
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,160
 Paul's letter to the Ephesians tells us that we were by nature sinners, deserving of God's

94
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,900
 wrath.

95
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,320
 In his letter to the Romans, Paul calls us enemies of God.

96
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,160
 Who better would know than Paul, who at one point was the church's biggest enemy?

97
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:38,020
 We see in the Old Testament book of Nahum how God behaves towards his enemies.

98
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:46,720
 In Nahum 1.2-6, the prophet Nahum paints this vivid picture of God's wrath against his

99
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:55,360
 enemies, calling him a jealous and avenging God who is slow to anger but great in power,

100
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,360
 who will not let the guilty be unpunished.

101
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:08,040
 No one can withstand the Lord's indignation and no one can endure his fierce anger, for

102
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,440
 the Lord's wrath is poured out like fire and the rocks are shattered before him.

103
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:24,280
 Moreover, in his letter to the Romans, Paul continues to say this, "Very rarely will anyone

104
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:36,080
 die for a righteous person, though for a good person, someone might possibly dare to die."

105
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:45,180
 But remember, we were by nature sinners, deserving of God's wrath.

106
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:51,180
 We were in no way good people or righteous people.

107
00:11:51,180 --> 00:12:02,480
 But as Paul writes, God demonstrated his love for us in this, while we were still sinners,

108
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,280
 Christ died for us.

109
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,980
 By his work on our behalf, Christ cleansed his people from sin.

110
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:22,120
 United his people to himself and secured their relationship with God.

111
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:30,200
 And because of this perfect redeeming work, God gave his beloved people to Christ's Christ

112
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,360
 heritage.

113
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:40,120
 And Jesus responds by gathering his people to himself as the holy object of his divine

114
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,120
 love.

115
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:53,120
 In fact, scripture calls us the bride of Christ, promised to one husband, to Christ.

116
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,360
 Though Christ is not physically present with us today, God's love for his people is still

117
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,280
 on display in the local church.

118
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:10,040
 In the church, God adds to our number those who are being saved, continuing his faithfulness

119
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,440
 to all generations.

120
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:21,120
 In the church, and we saw this in Pastor James' sermon on a word-rooted church, in the church,

121
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,160
 God speaks to us by his word as it is being read and preached.

122
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:33,280
 In the church, God gives to us the practices of baptism and praise God we had free who

123
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,240
 were baptized last week.

124
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:46,800
 And the partaking of Lord's Supper, of communion, is a visible sign that we belong to him.

125
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,040
 And as we come together to celebrate this visible manifestation of God's love for us

126
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:00,940
 to be a people for God's name, we see too that God has given us each other.

127
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:07,400
 He has placed us together to be a community, a family where we are able to support and

128
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:13,720
 encourage each other on our individual and communal faith journeys with him.

129
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:21,860
 Now we saw previously, to be a part of the local church is to be loved by God.

130
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:32,800
 And we'll see now how being part of the local church is to be loved by the church.

131
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,880
 Those of us who are sitting here today know what it means to be loved by God.

132
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,060
 I'm sure you've experienced or at the very least you're curious about the saving work

133
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:50,800
 from this loving and awesome creator God.

134
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,160
 But to be loved by the church?

135
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,760
 That might be a little hard for us to wrap our minds around.

136
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,740
 What does it mean for us to be loved by the church?

137
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,920
 How does being part of the local church entail being loved by its members?

138
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:16,480
 Well, when Paul refers to the members of God's church as brothers and sisters, he affirms

139
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,960
 the close familial relationship of every member of the church.

140
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:29,320
 In the New Testament, oh sorry, in the New Living Translation of Paul's letter to the

141
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:38,140
 Ephesians, we read that God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing

142
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,960
 us to himself through Jesus Christ.

143
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:50,000
 Because we have Christ as our brother and God as our father, we now have a sibling relationship

144
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,440
 with everyone who's also part of this covenant family.

145
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,980
 That means that just as it would be with a biological family, the members of the church

146
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:09,400
 family now have mutual responsibilities toward one another.

147
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:16,080
 God never intended that his people be isolated individuals.

148
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 As we care for each other, we experience and display the sibling love of Christ himself.

149
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:34,680
 In the local church, we are brothers and sisters.

150
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:48,440
 Now five times, five times, the New Testament epistles, the members of the church are commanded

151
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,480
 by God to demonstrate love and affection for one another.

152
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:02,080
 Being a part of the local church means that we are to express affection for every brother

153
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:08,440
 and sister and to learn to receive that affection in return.

154
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:14,400
 We are to regard the people in our local church, our brothers and sisters in Christ, with all

155
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,920
 the delight and warmth of a healthy familial relationship, covering their weaknesses with

156
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,280
 love and eagerly celebrating their advances in godliness.

157
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:34,640
 We are to learn their names, define other interests, and express our affection for them

158
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:42,040
 visibly and tangibly instead of only for the people of our choosing.

159
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:49,680
 We are to extend a hand on the shoulder, give a warm smile with a hand clasp, as Pastor

160
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,560
 John is so good at doing, giving this friendly hug.

161
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:59,520
 COVID times, you haven't seen him doing that, but I assure you he's very good at it.

162
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:08,240
 Reaching out again and again with a closeness that publicly affirms our family bond.

163
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:17,480
 Through such actions, we say without reservation and without partiality, you are my brothers

164
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,120
 and sisters, and I love you.

165
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:30,520
 As I share and encourage us to express our affection for each other visibly and tangibly,

166
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,440
 I must confess that I am preaching to myself as well.

167
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
 Why?

168
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:43,160
 Well, the beautiful, wonderful, and lovely people who are in my clan, my small group

169
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,840
 who are here tonight, hello, clan united, hello, will know this.

170
00:18:49,840 --> 00:19:00,240
 It is so, so difficult for me to get to know someone, to learn to open up to them, and

171
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,320
 to learn to love them.

172
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,400
 I am not someone who is friendly or welcoming by nature.

173
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,040
 In fact, I tend to be quite reserved, and I take time to open up.

174
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:20,440
 KFCI family, please do not take my resting grumpy face seriously.

175
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,960
 I apologize for the many times when I've looked like this.

176
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:33,160
 Pastor John has on more than one occasion called me the most introverted person in the

177
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,440
 church office.

178
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,280
 I'm probably only second to Pastor Johnny, who calls himself the most introverted introvert

179
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,560
 ever.

180
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:51,320
 But let me tell you, it's worth it.

181
00:19:51,320 --> 00:20:01,440
 It's worth learning to open ourselves up to community, to learn what it means to let people

182
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,600
 in.

183
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:14,080
 It's worth learning to express and receive love from this family that God has placed

184
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:23,120
 us in, even if it means that we're going to have to take some extra time and effort to

185
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,800
 do that.

186
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:31,240
 Now Pastor James shared this quote from his sermon on a community-based church two weeks

187
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,240
 ago.

188
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,160
 "Some people think they're in community, but they're only in proximity."

189
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:46,480
 True community requires commitment and openness.

190
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:55,960
 It is a willingness to extend yourself to encounter and to know the other.

191
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,900
 Now I cannot stress how much this quote speaks to me.

192
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:06,860
 As someone who sticks to something after she's made the decision to commit, but who has definitely

193
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:14,360
 been on this growing process of learning to open herself up to others, and in learning

194
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:22,420
 to extend herself to encounter and know the other.

195
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:36,320
 It hasn't been easy learning to let the walls of my heart down, and learning to let someone

196
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,760
 in.

197
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:49,920
 It hasn't been easy to be vulnerable, to share my burdens with someone other than myself,

198
00:21:49,920 --> 00:22:00,680
 or to confess my sins and wrongdoings to someone who might very well look at me differently.

199
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:09,000
 But I can tell you with absolute certainty that it is worth it.

200
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:19,440
 It is worth being in community to know first that you are loved by God, and to learn too

201
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:28,280
 that you are loved by his people, the church.

202
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,720
 Now the truth is that belonging to and being part of the local church will always increase

203
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,440
 our obligations and decrease our independence as we reach out to or get to know someone,

204
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,240
 or even intentionally choose to do life with one another.

205
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,000
 This is good.

206
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,960
 Though caring for family can be frustrating and can often be so tiring, as my family members

207
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,320
 who are also here today will so readily tell you, "I love you family."

208
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,440
 And so it is with the local church as well.

209
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,740
 We find that our brothers and sisters' joys and sorrows become our own.

210
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,700
 We find that we will share their grief and trials and disappointments, but we will look

211
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,120
 for ways to show love.

212
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,240
 And though that means that, yes, we will expect to have less money and less free time than

213
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:34,680
 we would have on our own, but we will expect to have added sorrow.

214
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:46,220
 We expect too to have great joy by having a people, a family of our own.

215
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:52,300
 Though it is a privilege to be loved by God and to be loved by Christ's family within

216
00:23:52,300 --> 00:24:01,100
 the expression and community of the local church, we would miss the mark of why it is

217
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:08,660
 important for us to be part of the local church if we neglected this final point.

218
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:15,180
 For as we saw earlier in our second point, to be a follower of Christ means that while

219
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:25,180
 we now enjoy and are privy to certain privileges, we have certain responsibilities as well.

220
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:34,340
 One of those responsibilities, as Jesus teaches, is to love one another.

221
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,820
 Just as Jesus loved us, we are to love one another.

222
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:53,460
 By this, Jesus says, everyone will know that you are my disciples if you love one another.

223
00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:01,380
 Jesus also tells his disciples that if they love him, they will keep his commands.

224
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:08,180
 And so as followers of Christ, we are not only to enjoy the privileges of being loved

225
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:17,420
 by God and of being loved by his people within the local church, we are called as well to

226
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:25,820
 love God and his people by joining ourselves too and becoming part of the local church,

227
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:35,580
 walking in Christlike love for his people and loving God by loving them.

228
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:42,780
 And the thing is, as we learn to love God's people because he first loved them and because

229
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:55,060
 he calls us to, we realize that even the responsibility of loving God's people is a privilege in itself.

230
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:02,060
 For the ultimate result of God's uncaused sacrificial love is to make the objects of

231
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,980
 his love lovely.

232
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,300
 Theologian Gary Williams, and I'm very sure you have seen this quote from Pastor John

233
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:21,220
 before, says this, "God does not find people who are beautiful and then decide to love

234
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,540
 them.

235
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:31,260
 Rather, he makes the objects of his love beautiful."

236
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:39,180
 The amazing thing about God, let me tell you, is that he sets his love on sinful, rebellious,

237
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,420
 hateful, and ignorant people.

238
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
 But guess what?

239
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:54,580
 God's love changes everything about us as we learn to love God by loving others.

240
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:00,660
 While we ourselves cannot change others by our love the way that God changes us with

241
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:08,580
 his love, our love for one another in the church does produce a sort of radiant loveliness

242
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,960
 that shines before a watching world.

243
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,520
 And as we meet together as a church body and family and love the people in our local church,

244
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:27,460
 we grow to become more lovely to each other and to God.

245
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:38,060
 We grow in love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

246
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:44,460
 The ordinary acts of love that we perform for Christ's church, whether it's taking the

247
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:50,820
 initiative to get to know someone or pray for someone we might not normally be drawn

248
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:58,040
 to or even to reach out to someone who's new and make them feel welcome, these are the

249
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:04,000
 avenues through which God makes us more like Christ.

250
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,500
 And as we are drawn deeper into the midst of Christ's church, we find that it doesn't

251
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,540
 stop there.

252
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:19,340
 Instead, we form relationships and build bonds of the sort that I talked about that allow

253
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,900
 us to meet each other in our sin.

254
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:37,380
 Now it might seem scary at first, and I know because I've been there.

255
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:43,320
 Because we don't normally participate in such a level of vulnerability.

256
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:49,840
 But as we develop the sense of trust that enables us to walk with one another in our

257
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:57,400
 battle to become more like Jesus, we find that no longer are we fighting and struggling

258
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,160
 against our sin on our own.

259
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:07,240
 Instead, we are walking alongside the members of our local church as we support one another

260
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:13,040
 in our journeys with Christ, partnering with God, and taking up our own responsibility

261
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:19,360
 to walk in holiness while the Holy Spirit takes on the necessary renovation work in

262
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,360
 our hearts.

263
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:30,600
 While this act of love and of being loved can be messy and painful at times, and it

264
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:38,880
 will require grace and self-sacrifice the kind that Jesus showed us, it is through these

265
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:47,680
 acts of loving others and being loved that we are given the privilege of becoming more

266
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,440
 like him.

267
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,400
 Now let me pause and draw back just for a second.

268
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:00,080
 If you think this sounds like something you could never do or accomplish, then you're

269
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,200
 right, you can't!

270
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,400
 The good news is you don't have to.

271
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:15,920
 God knows that by our own strength we could never muster up the kind of love that he shows

272
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:21,440
 his people, which is why he doesn't expect us to do it alone.

273
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:31,520
 Instead, he tells us that we, who are children of God, have received his Holy Spirit, that

274
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:37,440
 he might live in us and we in him.

275
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:46,800
 Scripture tells us that if we love one another, God lives in us and his love is made complete

276
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,240
 in us.

277
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,960
 Scripture also tells us that God is love.

278
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:06,480
 God who is love lives and puts his love in each one of us, so that as we love one another,

279
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,480
 his love is made complete in us.

280
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,200
 Though the process of loving and being loved by the local church can be frustrating and

281
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:26,280
 difficult, we don't have to worry about mustering that love up by ourselves.

282
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:34,720
 For as we look to God for the incentive of our love and for the example of how to love,

283
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:41,560
 we find too that we find that love within God himself.

284
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:52,800
 When the God who is love dwells in us by his Holy Spirit, we have everything we need to

285
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,760
 love his people.

286
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,040
 Now church, as I end here for tonight, let me challenge you to think about your answer

287
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,960
 to the question, "Why church?"

288
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:14,720
 Are you able, like the Apostle Paul, to see that while it is a duty and responsibility

289
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,400
 of a follower of Christ to be part of and to love the local church, there is at the

290
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:33,320
 same time nothing to be compared with being a Christian and a member of the body of Christ?

291
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:42,480
 Are you able to see the church the way that God sees us and to embrace that privilege

292
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,000
 of being part of your local church?

293
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,400
 If you are, then praise God, thanks be to God.

294
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,620
 But if not, then like Paul, I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order

295
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:06,260
 that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance

296
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:15,160
 in his holy people and his incomparably great power for those of us who believe.

297
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:22,560
 I pray that you would learn what it means to love and be loved by the local church,

298
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:30,320
 and in the process of learning, grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love

299
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,760
 of Christ.

300
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:42,140
 And I pray, lastly, for each and every one of us here tonight, that we would be devoted

301
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:53,520
 to one another, and that the Lord would cause our love to increase and overflow, not just

302
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:02,120
 for those of us within the local church, but for each one that the Lord calls us to love.

303
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,880
 Let us pray.

304
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,520
 Father God, thank you for this opportunity, Lord, to be able to, yeah, Lord, really speak

305
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,200
 with my church family, Lord, about what it means to belong to the body of Christ.

306
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,280
 Lord, you know that the community, body, and family of Christ is a special topic that's

307
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,540
 so near and dear to my heart, and I only praise you, Lord, that you have placed us within

308
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:34,660
 this church family, that we might learn what it means to love and receive that love from

309
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,660
 one another.

310
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:43,060
 Father God, I just know that love in the church family can be so hurtful, can be so frustrating,

311
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:49,420
 so messy, and so difficult, because we are broken people, and we don't know how to love

312
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,420
 one another.

313
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:56,260
 But Father God, as I just pray for us tonight, Lord, I pray, too, that, yeah, Lord, that

314
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,060
 as you have called every one of us here to be your people, that you would teach us what

315
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:08,620
 it means to, yeah, Lord, walk with one another in love, to take up the cross, to follow you,

316
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:13,940
 to take on our personal responsibility of walking in holiness with you while the Spirit

317
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,060
 takes on the necessary renovation of our hearts.

318
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:25,220
 And Lord, you who are love himself, I know that your love is made complete in us as we

319
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,960
 learn to love one another.

320
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,500
 And so, Lord, as I pray tonight that KFCI would truly be a church together, that would

321
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,340
 you cause our love for one another to increase and overflow.

322
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,400
 And so we just thank you for this time to be a body of Christ, to be a church family

323
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,180
 in a community where we are able to support and encourage each other, and we give all

324
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,340
 the praise, thanks, and glory to you.

325
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,320
 In your wonderful name, Lord Jesus Christ, we pray, amen.

326
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:09,320
