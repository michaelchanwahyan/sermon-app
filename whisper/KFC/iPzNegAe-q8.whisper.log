[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   - Thanks, Pastor John.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.200]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.000]   Yeah, again, my name is Gabe,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.360]   and I've been part of KFCI for the last two years,
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.920]   and very excited to dig into God's word with you all tonight.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.740]   Thanks again to Pastor John for giving me the opportunity
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.200]   and for inviting me to preach today.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.120]   So the past few weeks,
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.840]   we've been going through the book of 1 Peter,
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.600]   and in particular, we've been looking at the theme of hope.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.100]   1 Peter is a letter written by the apostle Peter
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.800]   to Christians who have been exiled, scattered,
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.440]   uprooted from their homes
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.120]   because of the fact that they were Christians,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.280]   they were being persecuted.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.000]   He's writing to a people who are probably confused
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360]   and discouraged by the persecution
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.600]   and suffering that they were facing.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.260]   And he writes to them to remind them of the hope
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.800]   that they have in Christ, to take heart, to trust God,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.720]   and to press on through their suffering.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.400]   In chapter one, we saw that we have been born again
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.460]   to a living hope through the resurrection
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.040]   of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.240]   And James asked us the question, how hopeful are you?
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.840]   In chapter two, Pastor John, he preached
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.920]   that we are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.960]   a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.440]   and that we should live according to our calling.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.680]   And Michelle reminded me last week from chapter three
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.800]   to follow Christ's example to bless others.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.440]   Do not repay evil for evil, but on the contrary,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.320]   bless that you may obtain a blessing.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.240]   And now today in chapter four,
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.440]   we will be answering this question.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.720]   That is, what is the attitude of people living in hope?
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.200]   What attitude drives the lives of people with hope?
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080]   What attitude molds our lives?
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.420]   Now there's a lot in this chapter,
[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.680]   so we'll only be able to scratch the surface
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.000]   of the riches of God's words today.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.760]   Peter gives many commands in this chapter
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.280]   and we can't touch on all of them,
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.560]   but he also gives us the motivation behind those commands.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.040]   And my hope today is that we'll be able to see
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.080]   the big picture for the reason why Peter commands us
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.520]   the way he does in light of the hope that we have.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.240]   So let's get into it.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.800]   This is 1 Peter chapter four.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.360]   Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.900]   arm yourselves with the same way of thinking.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.900]   For whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin.
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.280]   So as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh,
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.600]   no longer for human passions, before the will of God.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.620]   For the time that is past suffices for doing
[00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.280]   what the Gentiles want to do.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.520]   Living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness,
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.700]   orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.000]   With respect to this, they are surprised
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.640]   when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.340]   and they malign you.
[00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.040]   But they will give an account to him
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.720]   who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.960]   For this is why the gospel was preached
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.480]   even to those who are dead.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.760]   That though judged in the flesh the way people are,
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.520]   they might live in the spirit the way God does.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.600]   The end of all things is at hand.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.840]   Therefore, be self-controlled and sober minded
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.640]   for the sake of your prayers.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.160]   Above all, keep loving one another earnestly,
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.840]   since love covers a multitude of sins.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.640]   Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.920]   As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.760]   as good stewards of God's varied grace.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.880]   Whoever speaks as one who speaks oracles of God,
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.680]   whoever serves as one who serves
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.640]   by the strength that God supplies,
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.040]   in order that in everything,
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.440]   God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.240]   To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.680]   Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.560]   when it comes upon you to test you,
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.960]   as though something strange were happening to you.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.640]   But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings,
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.080]   that you may also rejoice and be glad
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.920]   when his glory is revealed.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.960]   If you are insulted for the name of Christ,
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.200]   you are blessed because the spirit of glory
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.880]   and of God rests upon you.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.040]   But let none of you suffer as a murderer or thief
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.360]   or evildoer or meddler.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.840]   Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian,
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.240]   let him not be ashamed,
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.760]   but let him glorify God in that name.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.440]   For it is time for judgment to begin
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.920]   at the household of God.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.240]   And if it begins with us,
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.440]   what will be the outcome of those
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.840]   who do not obey the gospel of God?
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.160]   And if the righteous is scarcely saved,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.400]   what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.440]   Therefore, let those who suffer according to God's will
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.400]   entrust their souls to a faithful creator while doing good.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.400]   This is God's word.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.240]   Now, the first thing Peter calls us to do
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.560]   that we'll look in today is to fight sin by following Christ.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.440]   To fight sin by following Christ.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.760]   The context here is that there are Christians
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.560]   who are suffering persecution as a result of avoiding sin.
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.240]   We see this in verse three.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.840]   For the time that has passed suffices
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.560]   for doing what the Gentiles want to do,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.760]   living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness,
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.640]   orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatries.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.600]   By Gentiles here,
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.400]   Peter is referring to unbelievers who do not fear God.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.720]   The situation is that the world around these Christians
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.080]   is completely corrupt and they're indulging
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.840]   in all of these sinful passions.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.400]   And then in verse four, with respect to this,
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.560]   they are surprised when you do not join them
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.280]   in the same flood of debauchery and they malign you.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.960]   Sin is so ingrained in the culture that it is strange
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.120]   when these Christians, when we do not participate.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.320]   And more than that, the world maligns, slanders,
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.040]   mocks these Christians, they persecute them
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.960]   because they choose not to indulge
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.960]   in the sin that the world wants.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.560]   And so the Christians here are suffering
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.480]   because of their desire to fight sin
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.880]   and to do the will of God instead of the will of the world.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.160]   And our situation might not be too different.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.440]   2000 years later, we live in the same corrupt world.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.240]   Maybe to your coworkers, one drink isn't enough.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.640]   They want you to get completely blackout drunk
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.960]   in their drinking parties.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.040]   It could be the same temptations to sex,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.760]   sensuality, passions, orgies,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.400]   or maybe you're pressured to worship idols from your family
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.320]   or to pray to ancestors in lawless idolatry.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.080]   We may be facing similar situations today.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.920]   Peter's encouraging the church to remain strong
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.960]   in fighting sin despite persecution,
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.320]   despite what suffering might come.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.120]   Verses one and two,
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.480]   for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.200]   so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh,
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.360]   no longer for human passions, before the will of God.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.720]   Here, whoever has suffered in the flesh
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.880]   refers to the suffering Christian,
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.120]   to Christians who suffer as a result
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.600]   of avoiding sin in this way.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.720]   Peter is saying that when we suffer
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.000]   in a fight against sin,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.360]   we demonstrate that we have ceased from sin.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.640]   He's not saying that Christians no longer sin,
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.440]   but we have ceased from sin in the sense
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.240]   that we are no longer slaves to sin.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.400]   We have truly decided to follow the will of God
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.160]   from the heart rather than to follow human passions.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.040]   In that way, we have ceased from sin.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.320]   And though we may fail at times in our pursuit for holiness,
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.000]   when we suffer in a fight against sin,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.720]   we've proved that we have been born again.
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.400]   We proved our faith is genuine
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.000]   and that we are God's people.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.800]   And Peter calls us to fight sin,
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.640]   pointing to Christ as our example.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.200]   Verse one, "Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.040]   arm yourselves the same way of thinking."
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:20.720]   And NIV translates this as arm yourselves
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.560]   with the same attitude, the same attitude as Christ.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.400]   This is the grounds for what Peter
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.080]   is encouraging us to do here.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.480]   Peter is calling us to suffer with the same attitude
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.320]   that Christ had when he suffered.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.040]   Now, what's this attitude?
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.280]   There's much we could talk about,
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.640]   but one thing to note here is that Jesus endured suffering
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.240]   by trusting in God and specifically trusting
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.080]   in God's justice.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.560]   Earlier in chapter two, verse 23, it says,
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.800]   "Jesus committed no sin,
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.320]   neither was deceit found in his mouth.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.720]   When he was reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.880]   When he suffered, he did not threaten,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.040]   but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly."
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.880]   Now in this letter, Peter has been hammering home the point
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.560]   that we have hope because of Christ's suffering.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:07.880]   Through his death and resurrection,
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.080]   we have been born again to this living hope.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.520]   And he calls us to persevere in the face of unjust suffering
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.800]   through the same attitude that Christ had
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:20.360]   when he was also slandered and unjustly treated for our sake.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.680]   See, Jesus never sinned,
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.160]   but Jesus was falsely accused of blasphemy
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.760]   and treated as a criminal.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.600]   He was beaten and mocked because of his obedience to God.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.240]   He suffered unjustly because of that.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.720]   And in the same way, we also might face suffering
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.880]   because of our obedience to God.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.560]   Jesus was tempted to disobey God's will,
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.680]   God's plan for our salvation.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.920]   He could have called angels to rescue him from the cross,
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.000]   but instead he chose to obey God perfectly.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.120]   He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.560]   that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.520]   And in his suffering, Jesus trusted God.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.600]   He trusted that God would judge justly
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.920]   and raise him from the dead, vindicate him.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.840]   And he also trusted that his death
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.440]   would be sufficient to save us,
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.280]   that God would judge us justly
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.480]   according to his righteousness.
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.200]   And that is the hope that drove him to obey God.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:13.520]   Jesus trusted in him.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.600]   And here we're called to trust God in the same way,
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   verses four and five.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.640]   They malign you, but they will give an account to him
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.840]   who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   Here, Peter points us to God's justice
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.720]   as encouragement to persevere in suffering.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.360]   Peter says, "God will bring justice.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.480]   He will judge the living and the dead.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.020]   We may see evil go unpunished in this life.
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.120]   Bad people may prosper and live without justice
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.760]   ever being served to them,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.160]   but God will judge the living and dead.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.560]   You cannot escape God's judgment, even in death,
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.120]   or rather I might say more accurately, especially in death.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.900]   Those who do not obey God,
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.360]   those who have not been raised to new life in Christ
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.080]   will face condemnation.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.320]   But we have hope from verse six.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.960]   For this is why the gospel is preached
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.600]   even to those who are dead,
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.120]   that though judged in the flesh the way people are,
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.320]   they might live in the spirit the way God does.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.040]   You see, Christ died that we might have new life
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.560]   and the gospel is preached so that we could have this life.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.940]   It is through the preaching of the gospel
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.560]   that we can know Christ and have faith in Christ.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.400]   And all who believe in him will be judged as righteous
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.380]   by the one who judges justly.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.340]   That's the good news of the gospel.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.520]   And so like Christ, then we can trust God in suffering
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.620]   and in our fight against sin.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.180]   We can trust that God hates sin and that sin leads to death.
[00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.120]   And then we can run from the flood of debauchery
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.600]   that the world tempts us to,
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.920]   knowing that it is a straight line to death.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.100]   And we can also flee from sin with hope,
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.120]   knowing that God is just and through faith in Christ,
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.240]   he will count us as righteous.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.080]   And though we may be mocked for it,
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.920]   people might say, why does God care
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.920]   what two adults do with each other?
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.440]   And though we may be mocked,
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.360]   we can fight for holiness with faith,
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.160]   knowing that we are bound for eternal glory
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.920]   because of Christ.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.640]   So people with hope fights sin by following Christ.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.040]   We fight sin by following Christ.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:11.480]   Question for all of you guys, you can type in the chat.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.340]   What would you do if today were your last day to live?
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.640]   Or it's actually kind of late in the evening.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.660]   So what would you do if maybe you had one more day to live?
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.200]   If tomorrow were your last day to live, what would you do?
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.960]   (pages rustling)
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:35.360]   What would you do if it were your last day to live?
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:42.640]   Anthony says, have a feast with friends and family.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.720]   Also John, gather family, spend it with family.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.560]   That's good.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.960]   Vincent makes good steak, I heard.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.720]   (pages rustling)
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.560]   Yeah, so those are all good things.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.040]   Lots of spending time with family.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.460]   Good, yeah.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.480]   So Peter also has something to say
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.440]   about what we should do in light of this.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.720]   Here, Peter reminds us that the end is near.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.960]   And in light of this, he tells us to stay alert
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.860]   and to love and serve one another.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.320]   This is what Peter calls us to do
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.480]   in light of the fact that the end is near.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.560]   You see in verse seven, the end of all things is at hand.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.840]   Therefore be self-controlled and sober minded
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.400]   for the sake of your prayers.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.040]   Above all, keep loving one another earnestly
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.960]   since love covers a multitude of sins.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.960]   Show hospitality with one another without grumbling.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.440]   As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.940]   as good stewards of God's various grace.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.360]   So here, Peter says the end of all things is at hand.
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.520]   And sometimes the end times in our minds
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.200]   are associated with crazy apocalyptic events
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.000]   like you might hear in Revelation.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.040]   War, famine, pestilence, crazy stuff, things blowing up.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.760]   The end times are not just restricted to that.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.800]   The New Testament authors, the Bible refers to us right now
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.600]   as living in the end times.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.720]   Jesus brought about the last days
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.440]   through his life, death, and resurrection.
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.480]   And this doesn't mean the world
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.180]   will necessarily end tomorrow.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.540]   But Jesus did say that he will return soon
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.500]   and he will come like a thief in the night,
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.340]   suddenly a time that we can't predict or expect.
[00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.820]   And so naturally we should say
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.060]   sober minded and self-controlled,
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.020]   which you might note is the opposite
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.940]   of the world's flood of debauchery
[00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.380]   that they would have us join.
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.380]   And it's a bit remarkable to me
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.780]   how really unremarkable Peter's commands are
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.620]   despite the end being near.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.900]   He doesn't say go live your best life now,
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.840]   have fun, let's go out with a bang,
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.320]   we're going to Vegas.
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.120]   No, what does he say?
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.280]   He says, people of hope, the end is near.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:59.740]   Stay focused, stay alert so that you can pray.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.980]   The end is near, therefore love one another.
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.500]   The end is near, therefore show hospitality
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.500]   without grumbling.
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.020]   The end is near, serve one another.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:11.540]   It's interesting to me how commonplace these commands are
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.280]   that he's saying in light of this.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.440]   You might ask, why does he even like bring up the fact
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.880]   that the end is near here?
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.900]   He's commanding us to do these everyday things
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.660]   that we're supposed to do all the time.
[00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.360]   We're called to love each other all the time,
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.920]   we're called to serve each other all the time.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:29.040]   And I think that's really kind of the point here.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.560]   The end of all things is to be expected.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.480]   The fact that the end of all things is at hand
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.200]   shouldn't catch us off guard or surprise us.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.280]   As people of hope, we should be living at all time,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.000]   looking forward to the hope of Christ's return.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.840]   Moving on to verse 10, as each has received a gift,
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.700]   use it to serve one another as good stewards
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.420]   of God's very grace.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.860]   Whoever speaks as one who speaks oracles of God,
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.740]   whoever serves as one who serves
[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.440]   by the strength that God supplies.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.520]   Peter reminds us here of the grace
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.740]   that God has graciously given us.
[00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.860]   He has firstly saved all of us Christians by his grace,
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.940]   but also God has given us various gifts.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.580]   We are one body in Christ with many members
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.320]   and the members don't all have the same function.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.700]   Think for a bit, what gifts has God given you?
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.700]   Maybe you're good at connecting with others, welcoming them,
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.060]   or you're good at teaching or at leadership,
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.700]   encouraging others.
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.100]   Some are generous givers.
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.560]   How has God gifted you?
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.420]   Whatever the way, whatever his very grace is,
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.500]   he has given you grace for a reason.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.520]   That is that we may love and serve one another
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.300]   and be good stewards of his grace
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.260]   in light of the fact that the end of all things is at hand.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.900]   And also in everything we do,
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.740]   we should be relying on God's grace.
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:01.380]   Verse 11 says, whoever speaks as one who speaks oracles
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.140]   of God, whoever serves as one who serves
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.140]   by the strength that God supplies.
[00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.340]   We should love and serve one another
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.260]   and we should do this, we should do everything
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.700]   by relying on God's strength, on his grace.
[00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.740]   And what's the reason that's given for that?
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.980]   In verse 11, in order that in everything,
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.860]   God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:26.780]   God deserves the glory, right?
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.780]   To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever, amen.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.900]   So we should love and serve by the strength
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.320]   that God supplies, by his grace, so that God gets the glory.
[00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.860]   By glory here, I mean the display
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.540]   and recognition of God's worth.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.180]   He deserves to be regarded as holy.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.300]   As we saw earlier, it is God who gave us every good thing.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.980]   He created us, he's the only eternal one
[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.540]   and he saved us through Christ.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.460]   He brought us out of darkness and into his marvelous light.
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.860]   And he equipped us by his grace to do the good works
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.940]   that he prepared for us to do.
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.980]   And so it's only fitting, it's only right
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.620]   that we see reality as it truly is
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.060]   and acknowledge him as our creator and sustainer
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.180]   because he is the one who has given us this grace.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.140]   How do we glorify God?
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.020]   How does what we do as humans
[00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.620]   result in God glorified through Christ?
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:26.100]   One way is we glorify him by relying on him.
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.380]   God is not served by human hands as though
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.220]   he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.180]   life and breath and everything as it says in Acts.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.020]   But rather Isaiah says,
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.100]   the Lord waits to be gracious to you
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:42.060]   and therefore he exalts or glorifies himself
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.220]   to show mercy to you.
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.340]   God is not served by human hands
[00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.820]   and he's not honored when we try to obey him
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.980]   by our own strength or when we try to fight sin
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.220]   and love others by our own works.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.380]   But God glorifies himself by showing grace and mercy to us.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.940]   God designed everything so that he would get the glory.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:05.660]   Salvation is by faith in Christ so that no one can boast.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.500]   If we can earn our own righteousness by works,
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.460]   the credit or the glory would go to us.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.860]   But we are saved by faith so that God gets the glory
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.260]   through Jesus Christ.
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.540]   And in the same way, when we continue to live by faith
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.020]   and to serve by the strength that God supplies,
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.060]   he also gets the glory.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.860]   He gets the praise and glory for saving us
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.260]   and for continually working his grace in us.
[00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.420]   And he is also honored and glorified when we rely on him,
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.580]   when we have faith in him
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.220]   and count him as worthy to be trusted.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.060]   Also, why would we even want to rely on our own strength?
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:42.740]   Remember how we were once slaves to sin?
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.540]   Remember all the times that we failed to love others?
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.020]   Even now, when we sought our own interests to love
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.420]   and serve ourselves rather than to serve others.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.340]   So would we rather rely on our own weak strength
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.340]   or by the strength that an all-powerful,
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.420]   omnipotent God supplies us in Christ?
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.580]   God's strength is better than our strength.
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.260]   And so we should love and serve one another
[00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.780]   by relying on God so that God gets the glory
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:08.780]   and we get the help.
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.940]   As John Piper puts it,
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.940]   the beauty of the gospel is we get the help
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.940]   and God gets the glory.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.260]   We are freely given grace, God's riches at Christ's expense
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:22.340]   and God gets all of the honor and praise.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.780]   When we trust in God, we get the strength
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.340]   and God gets the glory.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:29.660]   So we should love and serve one another
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.300]   by relying on God's strength, by faith.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:37.020]   Now, the third thing that Peter calls us to do
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.180]   is to endure suffering,
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.460]   to endure suffering through joyful faith,
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.180]   endure suffering through joyful faith.
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:49.620]   Verse 12 says, "Beloved, do not be surprised
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.780]   "at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you
[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:55.780]   "as if something strange were happening to you."
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.140]   Let's stop here and first note that suffering
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.020]   should not take us by surprise, right?
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.900]   We should not be surprised at the fiery trial
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.740]   when it comes upon us to test us.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.540]   It's not strange.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:10.340]   And one reason that's given for why suffering is expected
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.660]   is because Christ also suffered, as we saw earlier.
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.820]   Christ suffered because of his obedience to God.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.300]   And we will share in Christ's suffering as well
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.260]   when we live in obedience to God.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.100]   If Christ had to suffer, we should also expect to suffer.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.220]   Second Timothy says, "Indeed, all who desire
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.100]   "to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.700]   And Jesus said in John 15,
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.880]   "A servant is not greater than his master.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.420]   "If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you."
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.700]   We should expect suffering.
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.180]   It shouldn't take us by surprise.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.940]   God never promised us ease and comfort in this life.
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.820]   He never promised us wealth and health in this age.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:54.580]   Rather, he promises that we will be hated for his namesake
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.260]   and maybe to briefly digress,
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.340]   if we're fitting in perfectly with the world,
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.220]   if we're not really ruffling any feathers, so to speak.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.260]   Maybe we should reflect a little on why that really is.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.300]   But anyways, God doesn't promise that life will be easy.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.260]   But what he does promise to us,
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.020]   even though it might be difficult,
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.740]   is that all our suffering,
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.380]   all the trials of this life will be worth it.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.500]   Verse 13 says, "Rejoice insofar
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.180]   "as you share Christ's sufferings,
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.740]   "that you may also rejoice and be glad
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.380]   "when his glory is revealed."
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:32.020]   We may rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.220]   So why should we rejoice in suffering?
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.260]   We should rejoice knowing that our suffering has a purpose.
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.900]   Notice it says, "We are to rejoice in suffering,
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.700]   "so that with the purpose and result that
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.840]   "we can also rejoice in Christ's glory
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.460]   "as revealed at his second coming."
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.900]   We can rejoice in suffering because we trust
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.900]   that our suffering has a purpose.
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.420]   God is testing our faith.
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.540]   He is refining us through trials.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.380]   This points back to chapter one.
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.380]   "We rejoice in our living hope,
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.820]   "though now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.320]   "you have been grieved by various trials,
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.300]   "so that the tested genuineness of your faith,
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.060]   "more precious than gold that perishes,
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.060]   "though it is tested by fire,
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.620]   "may be found to result in praise and glory and honor
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.460]   "at the revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.700]   So we can rejoice in suffering
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.160]   because we can hold fast to the hope that we have.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.900]   When we consider Christ more precious
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.680]   than anything the world has to offer,
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.020]   when we're looking forward to this reward,
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.020]   this eternal joy that awaits us,
[00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.180]   then we can rejoice in suffering,
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.020]   knowing that God is preparing that for us through our trials
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.660]   and even with tears in our eyes,
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.540]   whatever trials or sufferings that come our way,
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:42.540]   we can rejoice.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.080]   We can rejoice because our souls are full
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.820]   because of the eternal glory that awaits us
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.220]   on the day of Christ,
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:50.300]   even if it hurts right now,
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.400]   even if there's pain right now.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:57.420]   More than that, we can also count ourselves blessed.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.700]   Verse 14, "If you're insulted for the name of Christ,
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.220]   "you are blessed because the spirit of glory
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.700]   "and of God rests upon you."
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:08.500]   We are blessed for one, because our faith,
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.460]   our perseverance in suffering is a mark
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.460]   that we are God's people,
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:16.220]   that we will inherit the hope that awaits us.
[00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.820]   Also, we are blessed now in the present
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.240]   because the spirit of glory and of God rests upon us.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.340]   We are blessed because God is with us
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.260]   even now in our suffering.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.380]   He didn't leave us out to dry.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.660]   Christ didn't just go to heaven,
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.980]   but he also, he did return to heaven,
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.460]   but he also sent a helper who is with us,
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:38.080]   the spirit who empowers us.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.900]   He's watching over us, disciplining us for good,
[00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.220]   and he empowers us by his spirit
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.620]   to persevere by the strength that he supplies
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.980]   so that God gets the glory.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:54.260]   So people with hope endure suffering through joyful hope.
[00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.260]   We have joy because we hold onto our hope
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.900]   when we look to the reward
[00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.820]   that we will live for the rest of time
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.620]   in the presence of God with no more pain,
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:04.660]   no more suffering,
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.180]   where he will wipe every tear from our eyes,
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.740]   where we will be his people and he will be our God.
[00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.020]   When we have that hope, we can rejoice
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.340]   because we are blessed, because God's spirit is with us.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.740]   And so Peter sums all this up in verse 19.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.540]   It says, "Therefore, let those who suffer
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.300]   "according to God's will and trust their souls
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.900]   "to a faithful creator while doing good."
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.900]   So let us endure suffering, trusting in God while doing good.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:34.500]   That's what people with hope do.
[00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:38.300]   People with hope endure suffering through joyful hope
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.000]   while trusting God and doing good.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.060]   We endure suffering through joyful hope.
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.300]   So again, today we set out to answer the question,
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.180]   what attitude drives the life of a people with hope?
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.360]   We saw that Peter commanded a few actions.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.340]   We're to fight sin, love and serve one another,
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.600]   endure suffering.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   And behind the commands, he gives some attitudes,
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.080]   some motivations behind them.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:08.320]   We should follow Christ, follow Christ's example.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.920]   We should rely on God's grace,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.480]   looking forward to the future
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   and endure through our joyful hope.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.180]   Those are the attitudes that people with hope live by.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.600]   And actually, everything that we've looked at today
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.560]   can be summed up in one word, and that is faith.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.760]   Everything that we've seen today can be distilled in this.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.460]   People with hope live by faith.
[00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.720]   See, we live by faith
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.200]   when we follow Christ's example in suffering.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.360]   Jesus obeyed God with faith that God would judge justly
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.800]   and that God's will, that God's plan was good
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.160]   and that it would be worth the pain.
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.800]   We live by faith when we rely on God's grace
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.720]   and live by the strength that he supplies.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.960]   We serve and love one another
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.480]   by the strength that God supplies.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.120]   And we live by faith when we endure suffering
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:01.080]   with hope, with this joyful faith
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.840]   that God has prepared an inheritance for us
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.140]   that is imperishable, undefiled and unfading.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.960]   We live by faith with our eyes fixed on the reward,
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.360]   persevering for the joy that is set before us.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.400]   People with hope live by faith.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.160]   That's the attitude of a people with faith.
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.600]   It should be clear from this chapter,
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.360]   from what we've seen so far,
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.080]   that Peter calls us to persevere by faith.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.440]   Also, the statement in itself should be kind of obvious,
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.240]   that people with hope live by faith.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.360]   You see, faith is having confidence in hope.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.840]   Hebrews 11 says,
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.600]   "Faith is the assurance of things hoped for,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.920]   the conviction of things not seen."
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.840]   Faith and hope are not the same thing,
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.200]   but they are very closely related.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.300]   Faith is the assurance of hope.
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.600]   So all we're really saying here,
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.640]   by people with hope live by faith,
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.680]   is that people with hope will live by
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.700]   that same joyful, soul-satisfying assurance
[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.360]   of their hope in Christ.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.140]   And that's what we call faith.
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.560]   People who are confident of their hope
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.700]   live by that same assurance of their hope.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.260]   This is pretty straightforward stuff
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:10.880]   that people with hope live by hope.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.600]   It's not really a groundbreaking discovery.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.520]   It's kind of like singing, singers sing.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.200]   That's what singers do, they sing.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.080]   Or dancers dance.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.000]   This isn't like 200 IQ stuff.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Like even the great philosopher Taylor Swift once said,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.800]   "The player is gonna play, play, play, play, play.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.220]   And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate."
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.880]   And in the same way, people with faith live by faith.
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.160]   Hopers gonna hope, hope, hope, hope, hope.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.160]   It's pretty simple, right?
[00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.960]   God's people who have been saved by faith
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.480]   live by that same faith.
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.840]   As it's written, "The righteous shall live by faith."
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.000]   People with faith live by faith.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.440]   And the question for us all today is,
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.600]   are we living by faith?
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.720]   Do we live by faith?
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.760]   And by that, I don't just mean,
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.340]   have you believed that Jesus has died for the cross?
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:12.920]   That is an essential part of a faith.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.560]   But faith doesn't just stop there looking back, right?
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.840]   The faith that Jesus, that Peter describes,
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.200]   isn't stuck with its head in the past.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.800]   It believes that God is at work both here and now
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.680]   and in the future, just as he was in the past
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.440]   when Christ died on the cross.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.520]   Peter calls us to look forward
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.200]   to God's final judgment in our fight against sin.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.800]   He directs us to look forward to the end of all things
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.000]   in our love and service.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.600]   And he points us to the hope of Christ's return
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.520]   as we endure in suffering.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.160]   And the hope that Peter presents us
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:49.100]   is that God will continue to do good to us in the future.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.600]   See, true faith believes in the cross,
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.720]   but not just as a historical fact.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.000]   Faith believes that Christ has bought for us on the cross
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.300]   all of God's promises and all of God's blessings,
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.720]   that they all find their yes in Christ.
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.920]   True faith believes that the cross guarantees
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.040]   that God will always be good to us
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.920]   both now and for the rest of eternity.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.800]   And if you have this kind of faith,
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.480]   it will necessarily change your life.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.000]   You can't have true faith and be unchanged, right?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.120]   If you truly believe that sin brings death,
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.840]   but God's will is life, then we will fight sin.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.640]   When we find Christ more precious
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:30.000]   than all the riches of this world,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.160]   than anything this world has to offer,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.140]   when we truly believe that this light momentary affliction
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.500]   is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.440]   beyond all comparison,
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.140]   we won't even be able to stop our souls from rejoicing.
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.100]   If we lose sight of that hope,
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.820]   if we try to obey God by our own strength
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.200]   rather than the strength that he supplies,
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.060]   that's how we will be discouraged.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.220]   We'll be shaken and discouraged
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.980]   whenever we face any kind of trials
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:57.600]   because we're working on our own strength.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.700]   And that's why Peter calls us to set our hope fully,
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.940]   our hope completely on the grace that will be brought to us
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.200]   at the revelation of Jesus Christ,
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.900]   so that we would live every day by faith,
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.900]   by the strength that God supplies.
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.580]   So are we living by faith?
[00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.380]   And if you can answer yes to that question, honestly,
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.240]   if the spirit is truly filling your hearts
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:22.060]   with hope and joy, then praise God.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.180]   That is truly a work of God.
[00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.500]   That is his grace in you.
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.460]   And if that's the case,
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.060]   I encourage you brothers and sisters to press on in faith
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.180]   with the joy that's set before you.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.620]   But if you're here feeling discouraged,
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:38.140]   thinking falling God really is tough.
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:39.640]   Christian life is exhausting.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.140]   I don't know if I can do it.
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.660]   God's commands feel like a huge burden on me, a huge weight.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.040]   If that's the case, then fix your eyes on Christ
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.040]   and he will give you rest.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.580]   God's demands will seem heavy
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.860]   if you try to obey on your own strength.
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.620]   But when you trust God and when you love him,
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.420]   then his words will be sweeter than honey
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.380]   and more precious than gold.
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.940]   If you live by faith,
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.180]   then we will understand what Jesus meant when he said,
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.260]   "His yoke is easy and his burden is light."
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.380]   Seek him with all your heart today.
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:11.740]   God is waiting to be gracious to you
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.540]   and he exalts himself to show mercy to you.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.820]   So are we living by faith?
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.280]   Does the hope of Christ guide our thoughts
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.540]   and mold every inch of our life?
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.020]   Does it compel us to obedience to good works,
[00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:30.020]   to boldness, for greater love and service to each other?
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.320]   Do you have that faith?
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.820]   I'll close by reminding us again
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.480]   of our hope from chapter one.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.180]   On us all to reflect on this.
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.340]   Does this hope fill our hearts with inexpressible joy?
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:48.380]   Does it stir us to live boldly in obedience to God?
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:50.820]   I pray that this all will be an encouragement to us,
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.980]   that this hope, this reminder of this hope
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.200]   will spur us on to live by faith.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.220]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.940]   According to his great mercy,
[00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.060]   he has caused us to be born again to a living hope
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.220]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.700]   to an inheritance that is imperishable,
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.940]   undefiled and unfading,
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:15.420]   kept in heaven for you,
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.980]   who by God's power are being guarded through faith
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.220]   for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.260]   In this you rejoice, though not now for a little while,
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.500]   if necessary, you've been grieved by various trials,
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.140]   so that the tested genuineness of your faith,
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.320]   more precious than gold that perishes,
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.400]   though it is tested by fire,
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.200]   would be found to result in praise and glory and honor
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.480]   at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.360]   Though you have not seen him, you love him.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:46.160]   Though you do not now see him, you believe in him
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.680]   and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:49.920]   and filled with glory,
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.280]   obtaining the outcome of your faith,
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.320]   the salvation of your souls.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.500]   This is the true great grace of God.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.800]   Let us stand for a minute.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.620]   Let's pray.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.560]   Father, we thank you that we have this hope
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.200]   that you have blessed us in Christ.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.220]   Lord, we believe in you.
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:10.920]   Help our unbelief.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.700]   Help us to fix our eyes firmly on the hope
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.860]   that is set before us in Christ.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.580]   Lord, we are weak, but you are strong.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.340]   Lord, you have saved us in Christ.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.060]   You empower us by your spirit.
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.620]   We pray that you would have us follow Christ
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:29.560]   in his suffering, that we would endure by faith.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.740]   Lord, we can't do this on our own,
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.940]   but we trust you that you are good,
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.820]   that in Christ, all the promises of God find their yes.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.220]   So Lord, we pray this with confidence
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.060]   in the cross of Christ.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:42.900]   Amen.
