[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.800]   Yes, I know that I use the expression "I am excited" a lot.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:22.440]   And I understand that there is a danger of this that you don't take me seriously.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:34.120]   But when I say I'm excited about One 2022, I'm going to ask you to take me at face value.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:42.040]   I mean, why wouldn't I be excited when an idea that started here in this church has
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.000]   spread to around 500 churches in our city alone?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.760]   Why wouldn't I be excited when an idea that started here in this church has spread to
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.760]   32 cities worldwide with over 10,000 churches involved?
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.280]   Why wouldn't I be excited when this week I've had the opportunity to be a speaker on behalf
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.040]   of Godfrey Church to address both the global launch and the Hong Kong launch?
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.400]   Why wouldn't I be excited when all around the world Christians will be listening to
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.480]   John's Gospels and the epistles together in their mother tongues?
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.640]   Why wouldn't I be excited when churches all around the world will be preaching the seven
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.600]   I am's of Jesus at the same time?
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.440]   Why wouldn't I be excited when small groups like our clans all around the world will be
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.760]   studying the seven I am's at the same time?
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.560]   Why wouldn't I be excited when Christians all around the world will be watching the
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.840]   seven miracles of Jesus from John's Gospel over the next seven weeks?
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.640]   And I'm not the only one excited.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:17.840]   I'm going to show you now a clip from Pastor Randy Frazee from Westside Family Church in
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.760]   Kansas City where I preached last year who is spearheading this global initiative.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.280]   And I apologize in advance for any sound quality, but it'd be good for us to hear this.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280]   Thank you, Anthony.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.160]   Well, hello, Pastor John and Sandra, the beautiful people of Kong Fok Church and the amazing brothers
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.040]   and sisters in Hong Kong.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.980]   Randy Frazee here.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.680]   You know, it was your vision that created one.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.160]   Yeah, several years ago, you guys created this vision that the churches in your city
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.040]   would unite together to make the name of Jesus more famous.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.560]   You also probably know this, that that vision you created, you birthed, has spread now worldwide
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.280]   to 32 major cities around the world, including Kansas City, where I'm at.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.120]   And for that, we are very grateful.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.920]   This is not just year one for us.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.740]   This is year two.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.840]   It was actually Pastor John's vision that we would go through the Gospel of John together.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.960]   And on Sunday mornings, we would all teach around the world through the seven powerful
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.280]   I Am statements of Jesus, in addition to collecting in small watching groups and this amazing
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.600]   listening plan.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   So we're super excited and honored to partner with you in this journey.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.360]   And please know that the believers in Kansas City are praying for you, that God would go
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.200]   before you and behind you on either side of you to make this journey together very successful
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.160]   for the sake of the kingdom.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.500]   Blessings and Godspeed.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.680]   Pastor Randy, that's exciting.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:00.320]   And tonight I get the excitement, the privilege of kicking it off here in Hong Kong at KFCI
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.840]   by preaching an introductory sermon.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:12.760]   Now because of our time zone and because we have service on Saturday and not Sunday, we
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.680]   will be the first of the 10,000 plus churches to hear this message.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   This is a rose.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.920]   Well, I imagine it's a rose because there's a famous line in a play by William Shakespeare,
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:37.560]   Romeo and Juliet, and it's said by Juliet, she says this, "What's in a name?
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:48.720]   That which we call a rose by any other name would still smell as sweet."
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:57.680]   She is suggesting that if we were to call a rose, say a rock, it would still smell as
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.680]   sweet.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.440]   But we are not defined by our names, that our names are meaningless.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.960]   Now what do you think about that?
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.040]   Well let me tell you my story.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.880]   I've mentioned this before.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.240]   My name was not originally meant to be John.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.160]   It was meant to be George.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.880]   I was born on what is known in the UK as St. George's Day, April the 23rd.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.880]   Now St. George is a highly celebrated saint in both the Western and Eastern Christian
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.640]   churches.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.120]   And George is the patron saint of England.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.160]   If you look at the English national flag, it is actually the St. George's cross.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.280]   And that features within the Union flag of the United Kingdom and other national flags
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.000]   that contain the Union flag, such as Australia and New Zealand.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.280]   But in the 14th century, the saint had been declared both the patron saint and the protector
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.760]   of the royal family.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.400]   The legend around him was that he had slayed a dragon.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.240]   But George wasn't to be my handle.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.640]   The meaning of George is actually farmer.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.360]   Farmer.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:31.440]   Sorry to our George Barlow, who is a perfectly respectable radiologist, and any other Georges.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.600]   But I mean a connection between me and farming just does not exist.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.480]   I mean farmers can be stung by dangerous insects.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.560]   Farmers can work with heavy machinery which can kill or injure them.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.720]   And farmers can establish muscle and joint pains from repeated work.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.720]   I say no thanks.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.960]   Back to George.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:01.680]   My dad, my father, who was 51 at the time, and ecstatic about having his first and only
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:11.200]   son decided to have a drink or two or more, and promptly went out to name me John Henry
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.840]   Snelgrove, the same as him.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.400]   I guess if I was American, I'd be John Henry Snelgrove the second.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:27.320]   And just let me say the name of John has nothing to do with a toilet or a male visitor to a
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:36.680]   house of ill repute, but actually means God is gracious.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.880]   How about that?
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   However, research seems to suggest that your name does have some impact on your life.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.080]   Let me just share a few.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:08:00.400]   They tell me that if your name is easy to pronounce, people will favor you more.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:10.040]   I found that Snelgrove has confounded most people in Hong Kong for 35 years, which is
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:20.880]   why almost everybody calls me John or Snelly, or even uses my Chinese name of Snelgrove.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:27.760]   Apparently if your name is common, you are more likely to be hired.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:33.080]   Maybe that's why I've only managed to have three employers in my lifetime.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:39.320]   They tell me if your name is closer to the beginning of the alphabet, apparently you
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.440]   can get into a better school.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:50.120]   On the other hand, if your last name is closer to the end of the alphabet, they tell me that
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.120]   you're more likely to be an impulsive shopper.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.960]   I don't know about that.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.960]   But we do judge people by their names.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.120]   Let me give you an example.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.320]   If you got dumped by a boy called Michael or a girl called Tammy in high school or college,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:16.880]   you will cast a negative judgment on every Michael or Tammy you meet.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.360]   So why am I telling you this?
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.160]   What is in a name?
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:30.880]   Well today as we begin this new series, Jesus is going to reveal his name.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:39.640]   And what we will see is this, that some people are definitely going to judge him for it.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:47.680]   For others of us, this name means good news.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:55.000]   Let's turn to our Bibles and to John chapter 8.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.080]   The Jews answered him, "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.160]   demon?"
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:13.760]   Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon, but I honor my father and you dishonor me.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.160]   Yet I do not seek my own glory.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.360]   There is one who seeks it and he is the judge."
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:33.720]   "Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.520]   The Jews said to him, "Now we know you have a demon.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.680]   Abraham died, as did the prophets.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.880]   Yet you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.'
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.640]   Are you greater than our father Abraham who died?
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.480]   And the prophets died.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.240]   Who do you make yourself out to be?"
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:07.240]   Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:14.720]   It is my father who glorifies me, of whom you say he is our God.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.120]   But you have not known him.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.640]   I know him.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:26.240]   If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be like a liar to you.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.800]   But I do know him and I keep his word.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:38.740]   Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:43.360]   He saw it and was glad."
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.880]   So the Jews said to him, "You're not even 50 years old.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.200]   Have you seen Abraham?"
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   Jesus said to them, this is the key line, "Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.960]   was, I am."
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:17.040]   So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.400]   temple.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.760]   Let me tell you the story.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:30.240]   Jesus has just gotten up into all the business of the Jewish religious leaders.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.120]   He has challenged them that they belong to the devil and don't believe in him because
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.280]   they don't believe in God.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.000]   Ouch.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.800]   Now Jesus has definitely not read Dal Carnegie's bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.360]   People.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:58.320]   And in John 8, 48, they answered him, "Are we right in saying that you're a Samaritan
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:03.040]   and have a demon?
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.500]   That's a punch below the belt.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:11.960]   You know, we've had this before, that Jews despised the Samaritans and looked down on
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   them.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.560]   You know that Jesus was not a Samaritan.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:25.040]   A Samaritan was a half-breed, half-Jewish, half-Greek, but Jesus was full on Jewish and
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.780]   he is certainly not demon possessed.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.200]   So Jesus denies their claims.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:41.380]   And then he says this, "Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.960]   see death."
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.940]   Now they respond to that.
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:52.300]   Now we know, now we know that you are demon possessed.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:58.060]   Abraham died and so did all the prophets.
[00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:03.660]   But if someone believes in you, they will not see death.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.380]   That's pure craziness.
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:14.500]   Then they pose this question with the attitude, "Who do you think you are?"
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.180]   And Jesus responds, listen carefully to what he says.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:23.500]   Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:29.620]   It is my father who glorifies me, of whom you say he is our God.
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.620]   But you have not known him.
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.140]   I know him.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.140]   If I were to say that I did not know him, I would be a liar to you.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.900]   But I do know him and I keep his word.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:47.900]   Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day.
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.340]   He saw it and was glad.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.220]   Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:55.460]   He saw it and was glad."
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.420]   This blows their minds.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:04.220]   He is saying that Abraham saw Jesus.
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.120]   Now what does he mean by that?
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:13.980]   He means that when God came to Abraham and promised that the Messiah would come from
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:27.140]   his seed, his family, that he believed God and saw it by faith, Jesus is that promised
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.820]   Messiah.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.620]   These guys are starting to catch Jesus' drip and challenge him.
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:42.860]   They say Abraham has been gone for over 2,000 years and yet Jesus is not even 50.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:48.340]   He was actually 31 or 32 years old at this point.
[00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.140]   And they make a good point.
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:56.620]   Then Jesus lays it on them in verse 58.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.940]   Let's read it together.
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:13.100]   "Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.'"
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:21.380]   Now according to my calculations, Jesus would have needed to have been born more than 2,197
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.020]   years ago to be here before Abraham.
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.780]   But Jesus is not saying he was there before Abraham.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:34.220]   Otherwise, he would have said, "Before Abraham was, I was."
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:42.940]   No, he said, "Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:49.380]   It means that Jesus wasn't born but has always existed.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.180]   He has no origin.
[00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.500]   He has always been.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.900]   So what was their response to this statement?
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.940]   Check out the next verse.
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:11.420]   So they picked up the stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.460]   temple.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:24.460]   Okay, what was it that Jesus said that made them want to stone him?
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:32.340]   Now to discover this, we have to go back into the second book of the Old Testament, Exodus
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:37.020]   chapter 3.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.020]   This is Moses.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:45.460]   Moses said to God, "Who am I that should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel
[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.460]   out of Egypt?"
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:58.500]   He said, "But I will be with you, and this shall be a sign for you that I have sent you.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:06.900]   When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."
[00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:13.820]   And Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:21.460]   fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?'
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.580]   What shall I say to them?"
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:33.780]   God said to Moses, "I am who I am."
[00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.420]   And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:44.180]   I am has sent me to you."
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:46.660]   So let's go back to the Exodus story.
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:53.340]   Israel, the Hebrew people, have been in Egypt now for 400 years.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:19:02.260]   They currently find themselves in a horrific, demoralizing state of slavery.
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:05.980]   Moses had been gone from Egypt for 40 years.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.020]   Remember he had killed an Egyptian.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:17.220]   He is hanging out in the desert as a shepherd with his family, minding his own business.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.820]   And then God visits Moses and speaks to him from a burning bush.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.220]   I mean, that would certainly get your attention.
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:35.660]   God tells Moses that he wants him to trek back into Egypt and to tell Pharaoh, to say
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:41.220]   to Pharaoh, "You can say it with me, 'Let my people go.'"
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:51.280]   And Moses says back to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.900]   of Israel out of Egypt?"
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.580]   I mean, he's saying, "Who am I?"
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:02.020]   He was given the name Moses by Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.940]   And that literally means, Moses means pulled out of the water.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.540]   You remember he was taken out of the river Jordan as a baby.
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:11.940]   But what's in a name?
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.220]   I'm going back to the beginning now.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:22.300]   Moses is saying to God, "My name means pulled out of the water, which I was.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.580]   And I'm grateful because it saved my life.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.980]   But I don't think that's going to do it with Pharaoh."
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.780]   And God says, "I will be with you."
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:36.860]   I love Moses' response.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:42.820]   Then Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:49.140]   of my fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?'
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.340]   What shall I say to them?"
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:56.300]   Now listen carefully to God's response back to Moses.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:06.180]   God said to Moses, "I am who I am."
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.380]   God said to Moses, "I am who I am."
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:21.980]   And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'I am has sent me to you.'"
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.940]   Now what kind of name is that?
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.740]   What it means is this.
[00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:31.140]   God has always existed.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:37.100]   That he doesn't come from someone else like we do.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:43.260]   He has always been, always is, and always will be.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:48.780]   The uncaused cause, self-existence.
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:53.700]   I am is present tense.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.420]   God has no past, present, or future.
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:01.060]   This is mind-blowing.
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:07.420]   Everything we think about God is now.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:14.540]   Everything that God is prophesying for the future, we are waiting on, but he is not waiting
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:17.180]   on anything.
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.020]   It means that God is eternal.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:26.500]   He has no beginning, and he has no end.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:34.460]   And God repeats himself, but shortened his title by simply referring to himself as "I
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.460]   am."
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.820]   "Tell them I am has sent you."
[00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:46.580]   Now interestingly, "I am" in Hebrew is just four letters without vowels.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.740]   They're all consonants.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:56.580]   The Hebrew language didn't add vowels until the 10th century by a group of people called
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.540]   the Mazarites.
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.060]   It makes learning this language very, very difficult.
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:13.900]   It's what we call a tetragrammaton, which means that YHWH is a four-letter word.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:21.460]   In Hebrew, it looks like this.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:30.180]   In English, it looks like this.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.500]   Does anyone recognize this?
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:41.140]   Out of the nearly 1,000 names for God in the Bible, this is the one that stands out above
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.820]   them all.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.820]   YHWH.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.340]   We just sang it, didn't we?
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.380]   YHWH, YHWH, we love to hear your name, oh Lord.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:55.980]   It is also pronounced Jehovah.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:02.860]   Throughout the Old Testament, whenever YHWH appears out of respect for the loftiness of
[00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:14.020]   his name, Jewish tradition typically replaces YHWH or inserts the name Adonai.
[00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.420]   It appears in our Bibles as Lord.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:22.380]   If you read the Bible, you'll see that Lord is usually in capitals.
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:26.820]   YHWH, his name.
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.140]   I just got a small observation here.
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:34.180]   Moses created all this trouble before God about the name.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:39.180]   Actually, when he goes to the Hebrew people, they never even ask for his name.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.660]   Okay, heading back to Jesus.
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:54.300]   Jesus is saying that he is the great I am.
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.880]   That's why they picked up stones to kill him.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:02.860]   This was in keeping with the Old Testament law found in Leviticus 24.
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:08.380]   It says this, "Take the blasphemer out of the camp.
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:15.260]   All those who heard him lay their hands on his head and let all the congregation stone
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.260]   him."
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:21.860]   So, the punishment for blasphemy was stoning.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:26.620]   But it's not blasphemy if it's true.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:30.180]   But it is true.
[00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:36.100]   Jesus is I am.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:41.600]   I want to finish this afternoon by looking at what it means for us.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.140]   What does it mean for us today?
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.540]   What is his application?
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:51.620]   I think at least four things come to mind.
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:57.820]   One is this, is that Jesus is God.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:01.100]   Jesus is not mere man.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.100]   And that's important.
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.100]   Now, why is it important?
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:15.720]   Well, if Jesus was born of the seed of Joseph, we are in big trouble because we are still
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.220]   in our sin.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.220]   Why?
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:24.660]   Because Joseph, like you and me, are born of Adam and Eve's sin nature and it's automatically
[00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:27.780]   passed down to us.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:33.460]   Jesus' sacrifice upon the cross, while noble and thoughtful, would not have paid for our
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.020]   sins once and for all.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:46.260]   That's why Jesus had to be born of a virgin from the seed of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:57.900]   He knew no sin and therefore his sacrifice is perfect and sufficient to remove our sin.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.700]   So that's number one, Jesus is God.
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.980]   Secondly, Jesus saves.
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:12.660]   Back in Exodus, Yahweh kept his promise and led the children of Israel out of slavery
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:18.980]   across the Red Sea and ultimately into the Promised Land.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:25.100]   Jesus' name in Hebrew is Yeshua.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:30.980]   In Hebrew, Yeshua means Yahweh saves.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:39.300]   Can you see this progression from Jesus to Yeshua to Yahweh saves?
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:47.940]   Yeshua leads us out of slavery to sin and ultimately into the Promised Land of eternity
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:55.140]   in his new kingdom, where we will be with him forever and ever.
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:59.380]   Thirdly, Jesus is present.
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.020]   Jesus is not a character we read about in a history book.
[00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:06.380]   The I Am is forever present.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.820]   He is with you.
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:15.500]   He is with us right now.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:24.660]   The best time to experience the I Am-ness of Jesus is when life is not making any sense.
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:33.660]   I've got to say in a week like we've just had, it is the best time for us to experience
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:43.300]   the I Am-ness of Jesus when you've lost a sense of who you are.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:51.580]   And lastly, point number four, is that Jesus will give us his name.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:58.180]   In Revelation 22, is given a vision of our life in the new kingdom.
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:11.380]   John says this, "They will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads."
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:16.460]   It looks like I don't have to walk around anymore trying to make something out of my
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:22.820]   name meaning God is gracious, John, and not Father George.
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:35.100]   The truth is, I will have the name of Jesus proudly tattooed across my forehead and it
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:49.100]   will signal to everyone, including myself, that I belong here.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:55.420]   The name Jesus is powerful.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.740]   He is the great I Am.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:05.500]   And tonight, he wants to do a tattoo job on you.
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.180]   I'm going to pray for you now.
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.380]   And I'm going to be praying that you would know, that you would know, that you would
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.380]   know this.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:19.420]   That you would know the great I Am, that Jesus is God, that Jesus saves, that Jesus
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:29.940]   is present, and that Jesus is willing to give you his name.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:36.460]   Are you willing to receive his name this evening?
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:44.780]   Are we willing to receive his name and take it to the world, to be hope for the world
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:49.380]   at a time like this?
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:54.540]   Let me pray for you and then what we're going to do together, we're going to declare that
[00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:59.700]   he is the great I Am.
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.340]   Let's pray together.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:09.780]   Jesus, we thank you that you are the great I Am.
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:15.820]   As we go through this Lent time together, as we study the I Am statement, I pray that
[00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:20.580]   tonight Lord, that you would write your name on our foreheads.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.820]   And Lord, we open ourselves now.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:29.220]   Maybe just take this time, just hold your hands in front of you and say, "Lord, I receive
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.820]   your name.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:42.820]   I receive the name of Jesus Christ, my Savior, my King, and my God, in Jesus' name.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.740]   Amen.
