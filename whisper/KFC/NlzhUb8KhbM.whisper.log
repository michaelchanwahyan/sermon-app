[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.340]   - Wasn't expecting that, but good evening, church.
[00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.360]   I'm excited to dive into God's word with you all today.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.000]   Yeah, as a church in preparation for Easter,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.380]   we've been going through the parables of Jesus.
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.640]   And we're not only doing this as KFCI alone,
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.840]   our local church, but we're joining along
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.080]   with other churches in Hong Kong and around the world
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.500]   as part of the One Campaign.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.480]   And now today we'll continue on with the parable
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.760]   of the rich fool in Luke 12.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.760]   We'll be discussing a topic that's maybe on everyone's mind,
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.160]   and as you can tell by the name,
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.300]   the parable of the rich fool,
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.240]   today we'll be talking about money.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.100]   Now money really needs no introduction.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.860]   We're all very familiar with money.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.520]   It's something we use, whether we have lots of it
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.320]   or not much of it at all.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.360]   Money is often front of mind for lots of people.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.840]   It's why some of us go to school or we go to work
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.400]   or we want our kids to go to good schools
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.240]   so that we can find a good job and then make lots of money.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.460]   Or for some, money can be a big criteria
[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.300]   when looking for romantic partners or making friends.
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.560]   That's just how it is sometimes.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.220]   So today we're talking about money.
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.640]   But notice that this is the parable of the rich fool.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.560]   It's also a parable about foolishness.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.400]   Now foolishness also needs no introduction.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.840]   We're all very familiar with foolishness,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.320]   some of us more than others.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.080]   But this is the parable of the rich fool.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.560]   It's a parable about both money and foolishness.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.720]   It's a story teaching us about foolish attitudes
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.600]   towards God and money.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.220]   It prompts us to ask ourselves the question,
[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.060]   are we fixated on money in a foolish way?
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.940]   Have we become fools in our love of money?
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.740]   And now before we get into the parable,
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.940]   I want to set the stage a little bit for the story.
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.540]   Because what we read today isn't just a standalone story.
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.980]   It's not just one parable.
[00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.660]   It's only a small section of the book of Luke,
[00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.740]   which in itself is only a small portion of the entire Bible.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.900]   And if we flip to our Bibles
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.060]   and we only look at verses in isolation,
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.400]   picking out a few verses at a time,
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.060]   we might overlook something that is communicated
[00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.300]   as part of the bigger picture,
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.900]   something that we'd only see with more context.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.260]   And there's something important that I'd like us to notice
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.580]   from the events leading up to this parable today.
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.100]   There's a reason why Jesus told this particular parable.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.740]   Right, in verse 13, we learn that someone in the crowd
[00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.460]   said to Jesus, "Teacher, tell my brother
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.700]   "to divide the inheritance with me."
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.340]   And then Jesus tells this parable in response to his request.
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.380]   Now what's the setting behind this request?
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.180]   In Luke 12, Jesus was preaching to his disciples
[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.960]   before a large crowd.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.800]   Look at verse one.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.260]   It says that when so many thousands of the people
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.100]   had gathered together that they were trampling one another,
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.340]   he began to say to his disciples.
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.020]   Right, so from this, we see that there was a large crowd
[00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.060]   of many thousand people trampling over one another
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.940]   to get to Jesus and to hear him speak.
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.380]   And in the middle of all that, Jesus speaks to his disciples
[00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.680]   but we know that the crowd was listening in
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.020]   because if we skip forward to verse 41,
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.820]   Peter, one of Jesus' disciples, asks him,
[00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.980]   "Lord, are you telling this parable for us or for all?"
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.460]   And if the crowds weren't there listening,
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.500]   then there'd be no reason for Jesus,
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.340]   for Peter to ask this question to him.
[00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.260]   If there was no crowd, there'd be no one else
[00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.400]   that Jesus was addressing.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.180]   So this question suggests that the crowds were listening
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.160]   in on Jesus as he was teaching his disciples.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.460]   The crowd, including the man in verse 13.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.760]   So we know that the crowd and the man
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.980]   was listening to Jesus teach.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.040]   And so we ask, what was Jesus preaching about?
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.620]   If we look at chapter 12,
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.860]   we'll see that he was talking about some pretty big stuff.
[00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.180]   In chapter 12, the thrust of his teaching
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.780]   is a call for us to open our eyes
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.680]   and expand our line of sight and see God.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.880]   Sometimes we're so laser focused
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.500]   on the details right in front of us,
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.520]   like my hand looks really big right now,
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.620]   but that we miss the bigger picture of who God is
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.460]   and God's purpose for us in all of this.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.120]   We can't go through the whole chapter right now,
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.580]   but here's a few snippets of Jesus' teaching.
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.860]   It's actually quite radical.
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.780]   Verses four and five, he says,
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.180]   "Do not fear those who kill the body.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.740]   "Don't fear those who kill the body."
[00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.160]   He's saying, "Gun to your head, don't be afraid."
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   'Cause what can that guy do?
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.680]   Just pull the trigger?
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.260]   All he can do is kill your body.
[00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.220]   That's it, kill your body.
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.180]   Now that's some pretty extreme stuff.
[00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.140]   It's quite jarring, but that's not all.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.200]   He goes on and says,
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.780]   "Don't fear those who kill the body.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.440]   "I'll tell you who to fear.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.860]   "Fear him who after he has killed
[00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.040]   "has authority to cast into hell.
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.700]   "Yes, I tell you, fear him."
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.220]   Are you worried about your life?
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.320]   He says, "If that is the case, I'll tell you who to fear.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.620]   "Fear God who not only can kill your body,
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.060]   "but sentence you to eternal conscious torment in hell.
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.460]   "Yes, I tell you, fear God."
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.180]   That's some heavy stuff.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.940]   Verses six and seven, "Fear God and then fear not."
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.160]   This great God who you should fear
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.520]   is also a God who loves you deeply,
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.260]   who knows you intimately,
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.800]   even he who counted all the hairs on your head.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.520]   He holds all of creation in his hands,
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.560]   and he cares for you.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.660]   So behold your God, fear him, and then fear not.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.100]   Verses eight and nine, he says,
[00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.400]   "Everyone who acknowledges me before men,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.360]   "the Son of Man will also acknowledge
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.660]   "before the angels of God.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.260]   "But the one who denies me before men
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.620]   "will be denied before the angels of God."
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.100]   Now this sounds hugely important too.
[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.580]   Jesus says that everyone who accepts him
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.420]   will be accepted before God and his angels,
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.220]   but everyone who rejects him
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.820]   will also be rejected on the last day.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:05.940]   The eternal state of your soul
[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.980]   depends on whether you confess Jesus as the Son of God.
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.340]   He goes on, but for all,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.460]   this is all heavy and weighty stuff.
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.900]   He's dropping major bombshells over this whole crowd.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.780]   So far, we see he wasn't talking about money at all,
[00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.020]   not at all.
[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.260]   There were bigger things at stakes,
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.380]   things that belong to salvation, right?
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.580]   And with that, we come to verse 13.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.860]   With all that hanging over us,
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.700]   right, look at what happens.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.620]   This is pretty crazy.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.780]   Someone in the crowd said to him,
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.260]   "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.460]   "Tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.500]   In the middle of all this,
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.620]   in the middle of all that Jesus was saying,
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.580]   somebody had the gall to interrupt and demand,
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.460]   "Tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me."
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.340]   Like what?
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.860]   This request comes out of nowhere.
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.460]   It's a complete non sequitur.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.300]   It's so weird.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.300]   It's like, what are you even talking about?
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.940]   The situation at hand is fear him
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.860]   who has authority to cast into hell.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.020]   And this guy raises his hand and says,
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.620]   "Teacher, my brother won't give me his inheritance."
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.820]   Like imagine sitting next to this guy.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.700]   I'd wanna kick him, like, "What are you doing?
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:17.780]   "Like read the room.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.380]   "Now's not the right time, not the time.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:20.260]   "Come on, man."
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.540]   Right, in the context of what Jesus taught,
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.900]   this request, this demand really comes out of nowhere.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.060]   It's so out of place.
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.380]   It's so silly.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.260]   We might even call it foolish, right?
[00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.620]   It was a foolish demand.
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.100]   It was a foolish thing for him to ask.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.340]   This man made a foolish request for money.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.220]   Why was this so dumb?
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.620]   Let me elaborate.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.740]   From this man, we learn an important point.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.300]   A foolish love of money both comes from not seeing God
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.900]   and also results in us not seeing God.
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.100]   We love money because we don't love God.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.100]   And conversely, when we love money, we don't love God.
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.420]   Right, this man was foolish
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.220]   because he completely missed the point of what Jesus said
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.780]   and who Jesus really is.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.500]   In verse 14, Jesus rebukes the man saying,
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:16.500]   "Man, who made me a judge or arbitrator over you?"
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.140]   Now, at the time, it was custom for Jewish teachers
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.100]   or rabbis to mediate or arbitrate in disputes.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.700]   And this man came to Jesus,
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.260]   seeing him as just one of the other teachers
[00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.980]   that he could use to settle his disputes.
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.020]   Right, he didn't seem to listen to Jesus or learn from him.
[00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.660]   Otherwise, he wouldn't have jumped in
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.220]   in the middle of Jesus' teaching this way.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.540]   He missed the point.
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.100]   His dispute wasn't Jesus' purpose.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.900]   It wasn't his mission.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.260]   Jesus came to us, God as man,
[00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.140]   to proclaim the kingdom of God,
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.900]   to call people to repentance,
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.740]   and then die on the cross for our sins
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.260]   in order to reconcile us to God and to each other.
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.860]   Right, this man didn't recognize Jesus.
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.540]   He was blinded from seeing what God
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.260]   was literally doing right before his eyes.
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.860]   And that's the root of his foolishness.
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:03.940]   He didn't know God.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.060]   He didn't know Jesus.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.060]   And what's also foolish is how light
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.660]   and trivial his request really was.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.820]   Right, he could have asked Jesus for anything,
[00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:14.940]   anything that he wanted,
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.700]   and what he wanted most was his brother's inheritance.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.140]   He wanted money, but not only that.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.740]   He wanted his brother's money.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.500]   He wanted Jesus to take money from his brother
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.060]   and then give it to him.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.500]   He wanted Jesus to intervene
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.740]   and finalize this dispute with his brother,
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.940]   to put a nail in the coffin
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.300]   and put this relationship beyond reconciliation.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.100]   And he did this because he was covetous.
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.020]   He was greedy for money.
[00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.820]   And out of all the things he could have asked for,
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.180]   we see what comes out top in his heart.
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.100]   Out of all the things he could have asked for,
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.740]   seeing Jesus, God face to face, he asked for money.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.180]   It's foolishness, right?
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.700]   Jesus had just said earlier in verse eight,
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.060]   "Everyone who acknowledges me before men,
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.100]   "the Son of Man, will also acknowledge
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.660]   "before the angels of God."
[00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.940]   The man asked Jesus for an inheritance,
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.580]   but he asked for the wrong inheritance.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:09.300]   He could have asked Jesus for an inheritance
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.660]   that is imperishable, undefiled, unfading,
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.540]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.340]   He could have asked Jesus to acknowledge him
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.740]   on the last day.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.820]   He could have done that, but that wasn't his top priority.
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.660]   Instead, it was money.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.580]   Money and not God is what he wanted.
[00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.620]   Now that's foolishness, that's foolishness.
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.580]   But I wonder if we also do this, right?
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.660]   Let us examine ourselves as well.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.100]   If put in the same situations, would we also be fools?
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.820]   Now maybe if you never heard of Jesus,
[00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.980]   it's your first time at church,
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.980]   or never believed in him,
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.740]   and quite naturally, you take the money.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.420]   If that's you, keep listening,
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.140]   because I have good news for you.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.740]   That's better than all the money in the world.
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.420]   But first, I'll address the church, right?
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.260]   I'm speaking to you, church.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.460]   We know God, we have his word.
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.420]   We know God's plan, that we are sinners
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.980]   and we couldn't save ourselves,
[00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.180]   but that God made us alive together with Christ.
[00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.700]   We know that people from every tribe, nation, and tongue
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.380]   will bow down and worship our Lord.
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.900]   We know that there's this hope of glory that awaits us.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.740]   These are big, heavy, glorious things,
[00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.780]   things like what Jesus was talking about.
[00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.140]   But sometimes don't we also get fixated at our problems,
[00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.660]   the cares of life right in front of us here and now?
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.380]   It's quite understandable because we spend so much time
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.300]   in the rhythms of daily life.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.580]   We live in the world, we go to school, we go to work,
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.020]   we have families, we're dating, we have hobbies,
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.100]   the baby's crying, the toilet's clogged.
[00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.700]   We live in the world and we're surrounded
[00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.540]   by the cares of this world.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.140]   And so I ask you, church,
[00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.980]   do we act like this man sometimes
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.220]   with our eyes off the ball, distracted,
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.700]   forgetting who God is,
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.460]   forgetting the truth that we confess?
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.020]   What's the top thing on our mind right now?
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.460]   Are you anxious about your life, what you'll eat,
[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.740]   what you'll wear, where you'll live, where you'll work,
[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.540]   who you will marry?
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.540]   But if God so clothes the grass of the field,
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.620]   which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,
[00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.260]   how much more will He clothe you, O you of little faith?
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.660]   All the nations of the world seek after these things
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.620]   and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.420]   So instead, let us seek His kingdom
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.220]   and all these things will be added to you.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.300]   Let us remind ourselves of the God who loves us,
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.540]   that we should fear who cares for us
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.420]   and fix our gaze on Him,
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.220]   'cause it's foolish to do otherwise.
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.220]   Let's keep this idea in mind as we move on
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.900]   to Jesus' response and to the parable at hand.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.340]   Let's look at verse 15.
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.620]   "And He said to them,
[00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.460]   "'Take care and be on your guard against all covetousness.
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.100]   "'For one's life does not consist
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.620]   "'in the abundance of his possessions.'"
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:54.460]   Right, this is important
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.300]   because this is the focus of the parable today.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.140]   This is Jesus' main idea.
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.860]   And He uses this parable to illustrate this point,
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.580]   what He means, right?
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.540]   And if you look at it, there's a command given.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:10.420]   "Take care and be on your guard against all covetousness."
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.260]   Now let's look at what covetousness means,
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.700]   since it's not a word that we use too often these days.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.460]   I would describe covetousness here
[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.540]   as an insatiable desire for more and more,
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.500]   and especially for more material possessions.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.420]   It's a never-ending compulsion to have more and more,
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.860]   and especially of more stuff, right?
[00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.820]   The original work for covetousness in Greek is pleonexia,
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.340]   but thankfully, as English speakers,
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.500]   we don't need to be experts in Greek or Hebrew
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.580]   to understand God's word, right?
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.740]   We're blessed to have an abundance of English translations
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.820]   that faithfully preserve God's word for us.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.020]   And what technique we can use when studying scriptures
[00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.860]   to compare different translations to see what it means.
[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.900]   And if we do that, we'll find that most English translations
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.860]   render the word covetousness here, pleonexia,
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.380]   instead as greed, right?
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.260]   "Be on guard against all greed" is another way of saying it.
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.220]   Guard yourselves against this compulsion
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.820]   for more and more, this greed.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.660]   The second half of verse 15 also elaborates on covetousness.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.820]   It says that, "One's life does not consist
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.420]   "in the abundance of his possessions."
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.660]   So we see that covetousness or greed,
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.980]   pleonexia relates to the desire
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.300]   for an abundance of possessions.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.540]   And that today is what this parable is about.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.660]   It warns us against this covetousness.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.380]   There's a command, "Take care,
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.180]   "be on your guard against all covetousness."
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.860]   And with the command, there's a reason given for it.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.500]   Do this because one's life does not actually consist
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.700]   in the abundance of his possessions.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.580]   Your life isn't about money.
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.180]   It'd be foolish to think that way.
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.380]   And for the rest of our time today,
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.260]   we'll be unpacking how this parable explains this command
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.060]   and the reason for the command.
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.220]   All right, let's start from verse 16.
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.020]   "And Jesus told them a parable saying,
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.380]   "the land of a rich man produced plentifully.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.780]   "And he thought to himself, what shall I do?
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.340]   "For I have nowhere to store my crops.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.620]   "And he said, I will do this.
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.820]   "I'll tear down my barns and build larger ones.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.500]   "And there I will store all my grains and my goods."
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.020]   Now let's observe a few things, right?
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.460]   First, this man was rich.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.780]   He's said to be a rich man.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.860]   He owned land and the land produced plentifully.
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.140]   It was a good year for him.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:28.220]   But even before the harvest, he was already rich.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.100]   He was rich enough to have barns built up
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.660]   before this massive harvest.
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:36.340]   Now let's face it, some of us here in this room are rich.
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.540]   Some of you are rich and can identify with this rich man.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:43.620]   There's some of us here that God has entrusted
[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.340]   with abundant material possessions.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.380]   Maybe you worked hard for five, 10, 30 years,
[00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.900]   saved up quite a bit of money.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.620]   Or you bought like one stock this one time
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.500]   and now it's up 10 or 100 times in value.
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.140]   You're rich, you got lucky,
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.820]   and this parable feels quite relatable to you.
[00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.820]   But some of us here wouldn't consider ourselves rich.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.260]   You're sitting here thinking,
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.740]   how does this parable actually apply to me?
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.460]   Like my Octopus card might even have
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.500]   a negative balance right now.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.100]   How's this applicable?
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.380]   Well, keep listening because this parable
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.460]   isn't primarily about being rich or poor or having money.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.260]   It's not a how-to guide on what to do if you're rich.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:27.380]   Again, Jesus's main point is take care,
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.900]   be on your guard against all covetousness.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.580]   And we can be covetous or greedy
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.500]   while being either rich or poor.
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.700]   So be on your guard against greed and covetousness.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:40.660]   The parable gives us two reasons why.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.380]   Number one is that covetousness or greed
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.860]   is ignorantly self-centered.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.500]   It is covetousness or greed is self-centered.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.900]   And to see that, let's do something a bit interactive.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.140]   I'll need some audience participation.
[00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.460]   So I'm going to read the parable again
[00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.580]   with some minor edits, my translation.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.820]   But as I read, I want you to count
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.340]   the number of uses of the first person,
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.860]   the number of times this guy is referring to himself.
[00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.900]   So it could be pronouns like I, me, my, so on,
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.020]   but count the number of times he's thinking
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:14.620]   or talking about himself.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.460]   All right, you guys ready?
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.700]   Let's do this.
[00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.540]   Okay.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.500]   "The land of a rich man produced plentifully.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.200]   "And he thought to himself, 'What shall I do?
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.860]   "'For I have nowhere that I may store my crops.'
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.380]   "And he said, 'I will do this.
[00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.220]   "'I will tear down my barns and I will build larger ones.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.620]   "'And there I will store all my grain and goods.
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.820]   "'And I will say to my soul,
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.900]   "'Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:45.140]   "'Relax, eat, drink, be merry.'"
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.860]   How many did you guys count?
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.620]   All I know is that I ran out of fingers.
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.200]   But the point is that the rich man in this parable
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.540]   is totally absorbed with himself.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.180]   All right, the purpose of his money is himself.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:00.380]   It's all about him.
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.740]   Right, we counted how often that he refers to himself,
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.780]   but let's do another exercise.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.380]   Let's repeat this, counting the number of times
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.280]   that he refers to others or to God.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.380]   I'll tell you, that game is a lot easier.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.460]   You can try it on your own, but I'll give you the answer.
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.460]   How many times does he bring up God or others?
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.060]   Zero, zero, right?
[00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.300]   He makes no mention.
[00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.540]   He has no care or concern for any others.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.980]   The reason for his money,
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.820]   the thing that's fueling his greed or covetousness
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.480]   is so that he can say to himself,
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:38.620]   "Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years.
[00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.940]   Relax, eat, drink, be merry."
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.980]   That's his ultimate goal, his ultimate purpose.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.740]   It's himself, right?
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.500]   But there's also something worse than not caring for others.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.300]   Pastor Johnny preached last week on the Good Samaritan.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.500]   It was prompted by this.
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.100]   We learned that the greatest commandment
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.780]   is to love the Lord your God
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.900]   with all your heart, soul, mind, strength,
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:01.060]   and then to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.700]   The rich man's love for money, his covetousness,
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.620]   led him not only to no love for his neighbor,
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.420]   but even worse than that, to no love for God.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.980]   Right, sure the man was rich.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.820]   The land produced plentifully,
[00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.100]   but he failed to recognize that all of it was from God.
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.500]   God created everything.
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.820]   He created us and gave us life and breath.
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.820]   He provides for all of us.
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.420]   Right, Psalm 24 says,
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.220]   "The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof,
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.500]   the world and all who dwell therein."
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.980]   All of creation belongs to God.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.460]   It's all his.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.820]   The man's harvest is God's.
[00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.620]   His riches are God's.
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.140]   And in the same way, all our money,
[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:43.100]   everything that we have also is God's.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.300]   God is the one who brought him the massive harvest.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.420]   Psalm 104 says, "You cause the grass to grow for livestock
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.580]   and plants for man to cultivate,
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:56.380]   that he may bring forth food from the earth."
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.580]   God is the one who brought him the harvest.
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.340]   And in the same way for us, when we go to work every day,
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.220]   yes, we work hard and we earn our salary,
[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.220]   but it's not all from us.
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.740]   God is the one who provides.
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.220]   He's the one who holds us in his hands.
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.660]   And one way that he does this is through giving us jobs,
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.260]   meaningful work for us to do.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.900]   And maybe the rich man, he worked the fields.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.340]   We don't know that, it doesn't say,
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.180]   but either way, even if he did, God brought the harvest
[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.140]   and God provides for us through our work as well.
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.460]   And so we see that against covetousness is self-centered.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.140]   Greed makes us fools because it prevents us,
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.700]   it blinds us from seeing God's goodness to us.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.660]   A love of money blinds us from seeing God.
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.700]   We might think that the money is ours, it's for us,
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.340]   it's from us, but it's not.
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.940]   It's a work of God.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.620]   So we see covetousness is foolishly self-centered.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.620]   Secondly, covetousness puts its faith in money.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.340]   Greed puts its faith in money.
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.780]   Look at this parable.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.780]   This guy is totally dependent on his money.
[00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.820]   That's why he wants more and more and never has enough.
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.380]   To him, life is entirely about the abundance
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.140]   of his possessions, how much he owns.
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.420]   And so he wants bigger barns so that he can store up more.
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.420]   That's what his life depends on, how much stuff he owns.
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.900]   It's what his life is all about.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.300]   We see this heart in verse 19.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.940]   And I will say to my soul,
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.300]   you have ample goods laid up for many years.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:30.660]   Relax, eat, drink, be merry.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.820]   The thought process is that money is my comfort.
[00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.020]   Money is my security.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.500]   And if I have money, then I will be happy.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.820]   Like if I have money, nothing can hurt me.
[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.180]   I can live a good life for many years.
[00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.780]   Money lets me relax, eat, drink, be merry.
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.580]   I have money, I can live now.
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.300]   That's the rich man's attitude.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.540]   And I wonder if we sometimes share that as well.
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.380]   Is there anything that we're looking forward to?
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.340]   Is there something that you think
[00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:05.260]   that if I finally get this one thing, then I'll be happy?
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.100]   I've definitely had some of these thoughts before.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.100]   Maybe you're working hard trying to save up
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:12.300]   for your dream home for retirement.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.420]   And you're thinking, once I have that one thing,
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.420]   then I can relax, eat, drink.
[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.660]   Or aside from money, it could be dating, marriage, family.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.620]   Let me find a beautiful wife or a handsome husband,
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.540]   two kids, and then once I have that,
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.860]   then I can say to my soul, be merry.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.340]   And what's the problem with this?
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.700]   Those things in and of self aren't bad things.
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.980]   They are gifts from God.
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.620]   The problem is that we weren't meant
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:39.860]   to place our faith in them.
[00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:42.700]   They can't bear the weight of our expectations.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.620]   Let's look at verse 20.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:48.620]   God said to him, "Fool, this night your soul
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.380]   "is required of you, and the things that you have prepared,
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.500]   "whose will they be?
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.700]   "And so is the one who lays up treasure for himself
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.700]   "and is not rich toward God."
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.820]   He was a fool at the end of the day.
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.660]   A rich fool, but a fool, and also a dead fool.
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.340]   His money wasn't trustworthy, it wasn't dependable.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.380]   It wasn't worthy of his faith.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.420]   You think that money could save you?
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.420]   No, what can man give in exchange for his soul?
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.140]   Nothing, we're a mist that appears for a little time
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.540]   and then vanishes.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.900]   We can't control the day we were born
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.500]   and the day we die, no matter how rich we are.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:28.180]   Even if you had it all, you could just die.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:32.420]   Or when life gets rough, you have your dream home,
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.820]   but now the housing market's down 20, 30%,
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.540]   or there's problems in your marriage.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:40.500]   Now you're tripping and falling,
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.780]   you reach out and try to grab the rope that will save you,
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.220]   only to discover it was just wind.
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.900]   There's nothing there.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.500]   We were chasing after the wind
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.220]   like we learned in Ecclesiastes.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:55.380]   Money, the thing we covet, nothing can satisfy our souls.
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.260]   We can't put our faith in these things,
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.460]   they're not dependable.
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:03.220]   We were meant to put our faith in God instead,
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:06.380]   a God who never changes, who keeps his word,
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.260]   who loves us and cares for us.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.780]   And church, we have access to such a God
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.420]   through faith in Christ.
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.020]   Let us not be like the man in verse 13.
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.940]   Who went to Jesus, who had the chance
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.140]   to see Jesus face to face,
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:23.380]   and all he could ask for was money.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.660]   We have all the riches of God through Christ.
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.820]   Don't throw it all away for money
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.340]   that's here for a little while and gone tomorrow.
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.140]   It's foolish for us to put our faith in money.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:38.180]   The third thing is that covetousness is foolish
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.340]   because covetousness will kill us.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:43.660]   Covetousness will kill you.
[00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.140]   How does it do that?
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.300]   Setting aside God isn't just foolish,
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:50.820]   it's offensive to God.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.940]   It's sin, and the punishment for sin
[00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.260]   is death that God prescribed.
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.060]   Ephesians 5:16 says, "You may be sure of this,
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.820]   that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure,
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.740]   or who is covetous, that is an idolater,
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.460]   has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God."
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.900]   Note that it says that covetousness,
[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:17.380]   everyone who is covetous is an idolater.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.820]   Covetousness is idolatry.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.020]   It's the worship of something that is not God.
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.940]   The love of money robs God.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.300]   It robs God of the glory that he's due,
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.580]   the recognition and honor that he deserves.
[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.740]   And when we seek money instead of him,
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.780]   God won't stand for that.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.540]   We saw how covetousness worships the self.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.220]   A love of money says that everything is from myself
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.980]   and for myself.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.860]   Romans 11 says of God, "From him and through him
[00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:47.700]   and to him are all things.
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.540]   To him be the glory forever."
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:54.740]   Instead, covetousness and greed says, "Me, me, me, not him."
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.900]   Covetousness is also the worship of money.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.900]   It says that I want money the most.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.540]   I'll put all my security in money.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.380]   Greed makes us look away from God,
[00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.060]   to the God who works all things
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.420]   for the good of those who love him,
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.620]   who gives life to the dead,
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:11.220]   who calls to existence things that do not exist.
[00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:14.140]   The God in whose presence is fullness of joy
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.420]   and life forevermore.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.940]   The God who sits enthroned with angels
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.700]   and seraphim praising him,
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.780]   surrounded by flash of lightning.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.980]   They're all singing, "Holy, holy, holy
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.540]   is the Lord God almighty, who was and is to come."
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.180]   But covetousness, greed looks at such a God
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:34.340]   and instead says, "No, I'll take the money instead."
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.900]   It makes a joke out of our holy God.
[00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:41.180]   And God can't tolerate our idolatry.
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.020]   He is passionate for his glory,
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.700]   that he is recognized as God and recognized as worthy.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.380]   He says through Isaiah, "I am the Lord, that is my name.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.540]   My glory I give to no other,
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.460]   nor my praise to carved idols."
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:56.980]   And that's why Ephesians 5 says
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:27:00.700]   that those who are covetous are idolaters
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.460]   and also that they will have no inheritance
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:06.820]   in the kingdom of Christ and God.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.780]   Greed is the worship of self and money rather than God.
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:14.340]   And God can't tolerate us praising such worthless things.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.060]   And so we are cut out from the kingdom of God
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.220]   and sentenced to death.
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.700]   We saw this happen to the rich man in verse 20.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:26.220]   He says, "Fool, this night your soul is required of you
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.780]   and things that you have prepared, whose will they be?"
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.740]   And those words weren't directed at him alone.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.220]   Jesus leaves us a warning in verse 21.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.580]   He says, "So is the one who lays up treasure for himself
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.420]   and is not rich toward God."
[00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:46.420]   So if you are covetous, the same will also happen for you.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.820]   You will also die.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.860]   And if we're honest with ourselves,
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.540]   we'll discover that we are all a little bit
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:57.300]   like the rich man in the parable, right?
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.420]   In our attitudes towards God and money.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.180]   How many of us can truly say
[00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.780]   that we've trusted God perfectly?
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.300]   That he has always been our greatest joy
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.740]   and that we have never looked elsewhere for satisfaction.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.340]   We're all a little bit like the man
[00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.380]   who demanded his brother's inheritance, right?
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.940]   Who of us can honestly say, "I always put God first.
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.820]   I see him as he truly is.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.300]   I love him perfectly."
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:26.380]   None of us love and worship God as we ought to.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.620]   And so all of us deserve death.
[00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.660]   We all deserve death because of our sins.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:34.340]   And that's why we all need Jesus, right?
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:35.660]   Jesus was a good teacher.
[00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.580]   He spoke to the crowds and he taught in parables,
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.820]   but he is so much more than that.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.380]   Jesus is righteous in a way that we are not.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.660]   Jesus also was tempted by money.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.100]   He was sent by the Holy Spirit to the wilderness
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.740]   where he was tempted by the devil
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.500]   with all the riches in the world,
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.420]   if only he would bow down before him and worship.
[00:28:55.420 --> 00:29:00.100]   But he overcame temptation and chose to worship God instead.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.420]   Jesus valued God.
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.020]   He considered God more worthy
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:04.620]   than anything else in the world.
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:09.380]   And also Jesus died on the cross for our sins
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.340]   so that all who believe in him
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.900]   will be forgiven of their sins.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:16.460]   And not only are we forgiven, but also given new life
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.380]   just as Jesus also rose from the dead, right?
[00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.140]   Jesus died not only to pay the penalty for our sins,
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.740]   the penalty that we deserve,
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.700]   but Jesus came to give us new life, right?
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.300]   Jesus came to set us free from sin also.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.500]   In Christ, we are no longer slaves to chase,
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.900]   to covet after money.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.500]   Jesus took away our foolishness
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.900]   and became to us wisdom from God,
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.180]   righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:51.260]   Life does not consist of the abundance of one's possessions.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.860]   Life is found in knowing God, glorifying him
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:56.620]   and enjoying him forever.
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.420]   And Jesus died to give us this life.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.580]   He died the righteous for the unrighteous
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:05.620]   in order to bring us to God.
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.500]   He died to set us free from our sins.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.500]   We saw this earlier in verse eight, right?
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.500]   "Everyone who acknowledges me before men,
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.740]   "the Son of God also will acknowledge
[00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:17.940]   "before the angels of God."
[00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.380]   The only way to God is through Jesus.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.500]   And we ask, what should we do?
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.180]   Maybe some of you in this room
[00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:29.780]   only heard about Jesus for the first time today.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.060]   You haven't yet put your faith in Jesus
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.420]   or aren't following him yet.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:38.660]   Or some of you here have gone to church for many years,
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.900]   but when you'd call yourself a Christian,
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.820]   but when you examine your life,
[00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.060]   when you look into your hearts, there's a nagging feeling.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.900]   I'm still worshiping money.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.980]   I don't really trust God.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.980]   Maybe I still have tunnel vision on the cares of this world.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:57.180]   I care so much about my job, my work, money,
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:58.740]   rather than the kingdom of God.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.140]   If that's the case with you,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.500]   then today's the day for salvation.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.780]   Today's the day to turn to Christ and be saved.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.340]   If that's the case with you,
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:11.300]   please find me or one of the pastors after the service.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.460]   We'd love to pray with you to tell you more
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:15.260]   about what it means to follow Jesus.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:20.300]   And after you do that, or for the church,
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.420]   remember there's a command given in verse 15.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.340]   Jesus says, "Take care and be on your guard
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.820]   against all covetousness."
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.100]   He doesn't just say do not covet,
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.900]   but it's a positive command as well.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:37.580]   He says, "Take care, be on your guard, watch out.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.900]   Don't get anywhere even near covetousness."
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.740]   How can we do that?
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.060]   How can we take care and be on guard?
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.540]   There's two things.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.580]   The first is that we need the church.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.980]   You can stay on guard, you can watch out on your own,
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:54.660]   but it's a lot easier when done in community
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.380]   with the rest of the church.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.500]   It's so hard to fight greed and covetousness
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.020]   because the sin is so insidious.
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.580]   We live in the world, in a world that doesn't love God.
[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.700]   We're surrounded every day by covetousness,
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.380]   by greed, a love of money.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.060]   All around us, especially in Hong Kong,
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:15.180]   people are stressing out about money, talking about money.
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.100]   I work in finance.
[00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.420]   I go to work and surrounding me is just money.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:22.140]   So the temptation towards success and wealth
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.260]   is there every day.
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.500]   And that's why we need the church.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.860]   We need brothers and sisters fighting alongside,
[00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.460]   side by side with us, watching our backs,
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:34.900]   to take notice when sin is crouching at the door
[00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.820]   and to point us back to Christ day by day.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.020]   When we're living life together in a clan
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.780]   or gathering together on Saturdays,
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.540]   we can see each other's lies.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.660]   We can gently correct each other's sin,
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.940]   confess our sin to one another
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.900]   and encourage each other to follow God.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.700]   If people don't see me and don't know me,
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.460]   how can they say to me, how could they know me and say,
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.820]   "Hey man, I've noticed that this thing
[00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.180]   "has been consuming your attention.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.420]   "You're always talking about it.
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.820]   "Is this really what's the most important thing at stake?"
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:12.780]   So if you're making a habit of only watching online
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.700]   or slipping in late on Saturday and leaving early,
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.660]   ask who is watching over you?
[00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.620]   Who's got your back to gently correct you from sin?
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:26.380]   It's easy to live life on our own
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.340]   if we're chasing the cares of the world.
[00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.700]   That's easy, I can do that on my own.
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.740]   But if our hearts are set on God,
[00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:35.780]   if we're serious about pursuing holiness,
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.260]   now that's tough.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.060]   That is hard to do alone.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.140]   Why would you want that?
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.900]   Why would you want to do it on your own?
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.340]   You wouldn't.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:47.140]   We need the church in order to guard us,
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.220]   to encourage one another,
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.220]   exhort one another to follow the living God,
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.820]   to guard against covetousness.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:57.660]   Secondly, we need to replace our love of money
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.540]   with the love of God, with a greater love.
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.900]   It's great to recognize that money won't satisfy us,
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.020]   but if we don't replace that craving with a love for God,
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.220]   we'll just end up craving something else.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:11.740]   If it's not that apartment, maybe it's that new sports car.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:14.860]   If it's not that job, maybe it's your girlfriend.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.580]   The way to fight covetousness
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.660]   is to be filled with joy in God,
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.420]   and then there'll be no room to worship other things.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.380]   That's why it's written in Hebrews,
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.980]   "Keep your life free from the love of money
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.060]   "and be content with what you have.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.560]   "For He has said, 'I will never leave you or forsake you.'
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.740]   "So we can confidently say, 'The Lord is my helper.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.160]   "'I will not fear.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.400]   "'What can man do to me?'"
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.040]   We need to fill our hearts with the promises of God.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.560]   He says, "I will never leave you or forsake you."
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:51.280]   God is abundantly enough for us,
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.500]   and when His promises ring in our ears, in our hearts,
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.640]   then we can confidently say, "The Lord is my helper.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.820]   "I will not fear.
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.800]   "What can man do to me?"
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.920]   When God is the greatest cry of our hearts,
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.200]   then the love of money fades away, it decreases.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.220]   And lastly, once our hearts are filled with God,
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.860]   then go, use your money as you wish.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.820]   Give as you have decided in your hearts,
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.120]   not reluctantly or under compulsion,
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.000]   because God loves a cheerful giver.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.380]   And if we love God, then we'll be rich toward God.
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:32.280]   And that heart, that heart is only possible through Christ.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.960]   So church, let us not be foolish.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.760]   Let's not be foolish like the man who went to Jesus,
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.400]   asked for his brother's inheritance,
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.560]   like the rich man in the parable.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.160]   Let's be wise and make Christ our greatest treasure.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.240]   Let's pray.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:54.800]   For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father,
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.540]   from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
[00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.400]   that according to the riches of His glory,
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.080]   He may grant you to be strengthened with power
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.680]   through His Spirit in your inner being,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.780]   so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith,
[00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:09.120]   that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.920]   will have the strength to comprehend with all the saints,
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.880]   what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.900]   and to know the love of God that surpasses knowledge.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.360]   Lord, we pray, open our eyes
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.920]   that we may behold the beauty of your Son.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.200]   We pray that we'd be struck by your majesty,
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.800]   that we'd be so struck by your glory
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.280]   that we could do nothing else
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.640]   but fall on our knees and worship you.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.440]   We ask that you would turn our eyes upon your Son,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.740]   so that the things that were so big and important to us once
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.800]   would pale in comparison to knowing you.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.120]   And we ask that you'd help us do this practically,
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.240]   day by day, as we go back to the rhythms of our daily lives,
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.360]   that your Spirit would remind us constantly
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.120]   of your surpassing worth.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.040]   Help us to be a church that loves one another,
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.200]   who knows one another,
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.760]   and is constantly pointing one another back to you.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.880]   And to Him who's able to do far more abundantly
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.240]   than all that we ask or think,
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.640]   according to the power at work within us,
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:05.680]   to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus,
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.800]   forever and ever. Amen.
