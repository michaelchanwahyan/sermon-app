[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.960]   Welcome those of you who are on Zoom and those who are on YouTube.
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.400]   And as you may know, I'm speaking to you from Thailand.
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.240]   And I was stuck here because of a travel ban.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.400]   I'm your first Thai speaker, or speaker from Thailand, I guess.
[00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.000]   And it's great to be with you.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.120]   And we thank you, Pastor John, last week, he started us off this great series on the
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.920]   seven I am's.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.680]   And he introduced to us what the I am originally comes from.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.240]   And it comes from the name of the Lord, Yahweh, from the Old Testament.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.680]   And it is great to see also the connection from the Old Testament to the New Testament,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.680]   where Jesus himself claims to be the I am.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.400]   He says in chapter eight, verse 58, Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.240]   before Abraham was, I am.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.480]   Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:16.240]   And so we kick off this story, actually a couple chapters before in John chapter six.
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.480]   And it's the story of the feeding of the 5,000.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.840]   Has anybody heard of the story of the feeding of the 5,000?
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.080]   It should be a very familiar story.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.880]   And what happens is that Passover was actually right around the corner.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:41.600]   And Jesus says to them, "Where should we have by bread to feed all these people?"
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.640]   And once again, they were in the city of Tiberias, near the Sea of Galilee.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.200]   And Jesus says to them, "Where should we buy bread so that these people may eat?"
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.680]   He said this to test them, for he himself knew what he would do.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:08.640]   And Philip answered him, "200 denarii worth of bread would not be enough to feed them,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.920]   to get a little."
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.560]   A denarii was a person's daily wage at that time.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.600]   And so obviously Jesus was testing his disciples.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.800]   Passover was right around the corner.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.720]   And he was questioning them, "Where should we buy bread?"
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.120]   And the scripture says to us that there was 5,000 men.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.960]   And so probably it was almost double the amount of people that needed to be fed there.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.920]   And Jesus performed a miracle.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.000]   He prayed to heaven.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And the Father fed them.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.720]   And they had more than enough.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.560]   And it says in the scripture that they gathered 12 basketfuls of bread and of fish that were
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.360]   left over.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:11.280]   And the video made it very clear to us that afterwards Jesus isolated himself to the mountaintop
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.680]   because these people saw the miracle that Jesus performed.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.560]   And they were about to crown him king.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:29.600]   And so before they were able to do that, in order to not speed the coming of the crucifixion,
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.760]   Jesus fled.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.440]   Jesus isolated himself.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.520]   And the disciples got on their boats and they were waiting for Jesus on the boats.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.640]   And then a storm came.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.920]   It became very dark.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.120]   And the winds picked up.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.560]   And what happened was Jesus walked on water.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:58.840]   And so when Jesus walked on water and arrived at their boat, what happened was that they
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.600]   went to another city, the other city, unto the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.440]   And so the next morning, as the video showed us, they were looking for Jesus.
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.280]   They couldn't find him.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.980]   They couldn't find him in their town.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.600]   And so they got on their boats and went to, through the Sea of Galilee, onto the other
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   side.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.640]   And this is where we see the passage.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:33.040]   When they found him on the other side of the Sea, they said to him, "Rabbi, when did you
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   come?"
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.360]   And Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.760]   I say to you, you are seeking me not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.000]   of the loaves.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.560]   Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.260]   Son of Man will give to you.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.600]   For on him, God the Father has set his seal."
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.080]   And first thing that Jesus points out is that these people were seeking not after Jesus.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.560]   They were seeking after the loaves of bread, which filled their bellies.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.760]   These people were seeking a temporary physical satisfaction.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:31.880]   And Jesus questions them and instead says, "Don't just look for food or bread that satisfies
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:42.400]   temporarily, but look for something spiritual that only I can satisfy, that leads to eternal
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.320]   life."
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.440]   And isn't it the same?
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:57.760]   That today, sometimes we seek after Jesus because he gives us the things that we want.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:04.320]   We want Jesus because he can offer, even at this time, we are praying for healing in the
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.320]   midst of COVID.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.960]   We are praying for protection, yes.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.360]   But the question is, are we truly seeking after Jesus himself, not just what he can
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.160]   provide us?
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.920]   There's this song and it's called "More Than Anything" by Natalie Grant.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.260]   Help me want the healer more than the healing.
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.180]   Help me want the savior more than the saving.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.020]   Help me want the giver more than the giving.
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.120]   Help me want you, Jesus, more than anything.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.440]   Jesus is claiming here that he is enough.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:58.040]   It's not just about what he can give you, but that he himself is enough.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.640]   And so the question we have to ask ourselves is, are we truly seeking Jesus?
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:10.840]   Are we truly seeking him and not just what he can provide us?
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.680]   Before being in Thailand, I was visiting my family who I haven't seen for two years.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.680]   And Canada is really cold right now.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.320]   It's like negative two or below zero.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:26.520]   And I had a great time there just spending time with people at church.
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.060]   And I got really close to some of them and we would go work out or we would go snowboard
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.560]   every other day or something like that because Omnicom was pretty bad at that time and there
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.260]   wasn't that much to do, right?
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.160]   All you could do was go work out and go snowboard.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.700]   But as soon as I left Canada and Toronto and I started continuing messaging some of these
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:55.160]   friends who I was really close to, they would ignore me.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:01.680]   And I felt like, wow, as soon as I left Toronto, it's as if I can't snowboard with you or I
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.220]   can't work out with you anymore.
[00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:07.780]   So you don't even bother messaging me anymore.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.720]   And this is sort of what Jesus was saying.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.540]   You're only coming to me because I can provide you bread.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.200]   I can provide you healing.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.540]   I can provide you protection.
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.540]   But are you truly seeking after me?
[00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:32.060]   It's as if I left Toronto and my friends didn't care about me anymore because I couldn't snowboard
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.260]   with them or I couldn't work out with them anymore.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.980]   That's sort of how I felt.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:45.460]   So the question for you, for us today is, are we truly seeking Jesus?
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:50.740]   Not just after what he can give us.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.380]   These people continue.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:58.660]   And so they say to him, what must we do to be doing the works of God?
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.180]   You know, they're genuinely seeking Jesus.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.180]   They want to genuinely seeking God.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.380]   They genuinely want to know God.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:15.380]   And Jesus answered them, this is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.740]   sent.
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:22.620]   And so they said, then what sign do you do that we may see and believe you?
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.320]   What work do you perform?
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.900]   Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness as it is written.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.100]   He gave them the bread from heaven to eat.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.860]   And Jesus said to them, truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.820]   bread from heaven, but my father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
[00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:50.420]   For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.
[00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:57.220]   Jesus is saying here that he is proven.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.100]   He is proven.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:09.380]   Now these people who were chasing after Jesus, they were caught in their own religious, religiosity,
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.260]   religiousness.
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:16.260]   They believed in their set ways of going to the father.
[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.620]   And that was to them, the old covenant.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:25.980]   They were trying to gain their salvation by works, right?
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.840]   Their question was, what must we be doing?
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:35.740]   What must we be, what must we do to be doing the works of God?
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.700]   They counted on their own works to save them.
[00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:48.340]   A lot like the Pharisees who have memorized the scriptures, who are living the high life.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:53.460]   But Jesus is saying, what must you do?
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:11:00.380]   All you must do is believe in the one whom he has sent.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.580]   And Jesus makes a very special claim here.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:10.500]   That it is not Moses who gave you the bread, but it is my father.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.580]   My father.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.580]   And they would be saying, isn't this the son of Joseph?
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.540]   Jesus, the son of Joseph?
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.020]   What do you mean it's your father?
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:26.660]   Jesus is claiming that him and the father are one.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.700]   God and him are working together.
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.740]   And it is he, the father, who sent him.
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.980]   Jesus is proven.
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.620]   Jesus is the new covenant.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:49.940]   Jesus is greater than Moses because God sent the manna.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:55.300]   It is not Moses who sent the manna.
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:03.860]   And so the second question we need to ask ourselves is, are we working for our own salvation?
[00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:07.780]   These people were caught up in the old covenant.
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:12.660]   These people were caught up in their own religious thoughts.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:22.620]   Their religion was preventing them from accepting Jesus as their personal savior.
[00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.060]   And a lot of times we might be working for our own salvation.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.580]   This is a picture of us doing good works.
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:34.860]   We were handing out lunch boxes before the fifth wave.
[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.580]   You see Betty there and Carmen and one of our tightest kids.
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.220]   We were handing out food.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:47.140]   And a lot of the times, even as us Christians today, we may feel like we need to do more
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.940]   so that we could be gaining our own salvation.
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.380]   And I've shared this many times because I'm a doer.
[00:12:54.380 --> 00:13:00.900]   A lot of the times I feel like, oh, the more I do, the more God would love me.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:08.780]   And that's not true because our salvation comes through our faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:15.460]   And so the second question we need to ask ourselves is, are we working for our salvation
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:23.380]   instead of placing our faith wholeheartedly in who Jesus is?
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:31.020]   And the last thing we want to look at, they said, sir, give us this bread always.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.380]   They were interested.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:34.780]   They want this bread, right?
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.100]   That would lead to eternal life.
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.700]   And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life.
[00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:46.620]   Whoever comes to me shall not hunger.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.500]   Whoever believes in me shall not thirst.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:55.060]   That I say to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:02.140]   All that the father gives will come to me and whoever comes to me, I will never cast
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.940]   out.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:11.860]   Jesus is saying here that he alone saves.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.020]   He is proven.
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.820]   He is enough.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:22.040]   He is the bread of life that saves.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.700]   Whoever believes in him, he promises several things in these scriptures.
[00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.320]   You shall never hunger again.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.780]   And that doesn't mean physically we won't hunger.
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.700]   I still eat like a growing teenager, right?
[00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.500]   I still order several meals.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:49.860]   He's saying that we who receive Jesus Christ will be satisfied spiritually because he is
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.980]   enough.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:57.180]   He believes, he promises that we shall not thirst.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:02.820]   He will satisfy the deepest conscious of our thirst.
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.180]   That as the father sends us to Jesus, we will never be cast out.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.580]   That we will have eternal life.
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.780]   And when he returns on the last day, we will be raised with Christ.
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:23.540]   We are a new creation because we have been baptized with Christ.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:28.700]   We will be saved when we confess with our mouth and believe in our heart that Jesus
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:34.220]   Christ died and rose again.
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.660]   And so once again, Jesus is making his claim here.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.320]   That he is the bread of life.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.600]   He is enough.
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.740]   He is proven.
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:51.400]   We don't have to go look for anything else or anyone else.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.180]   He himself is proven.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.540]   He and the father are one.
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:02.420]   The father sent him so that he could save us.
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:06.860]   And so Jesus is the bread of life.
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.980]   He is authentic.
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:09.980]   He is sufficient.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:18.740]   And he is constantly supplying us with the strength we need to go through these tough
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.780]   times.
[00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:24.020]   Jesus alone saves.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:31.140]   And so there are several questions we need to reflect on as we listen on this message
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.260]   of the bread of life.
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:38.500]   The first is, are we truly seeking after Jesus?
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:44.340]   Yes, we need to pray to Jesus for protection for our loved one.
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:48.460]   Yes, we need to pray to Jesus for healing in the midst of COVID.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.140]   We need to pray for Jesus to give us mercy.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:57.140]   Yes, he can provide all those things because he is all powerful.
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.100]   He can feed the 5,000.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.620]   He can calm the storm.
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.780]   He can walk on water.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:13.220]   But Jesus' questions, are we truly seeking after him or just what he can provide?
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:22.540]   Today, as we go in our quiet times, are we truly seeking after Jesus?
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:30.580]   It's so easy for us to just get caught up in the world and neglect Jesus himself.
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.260]   Are we truly seeking Jesus?
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:43.540]   And the second thing is, for those who are saved as well, are we working for our salvation?
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:49.780]   Instead of placing our faith, our belief fully on him.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:51.500]   We can gain the whole world.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.380]   We can gain all the money in the world.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:59.300]   But we will not be able to go to heaven because that is not the key to heaven.
[00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.220]   Jesus is the key to heaven.
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.020]   He is the bread of life.
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.060]   Only he can save us.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:12.220]   And lastly, have you been saved?
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.940]   Have you been saved?
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:21.060]   Have you prayed and asked Jesus Christ to be the Lord and Savior of your life?
[00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.940]   Have you received the bread of life?
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.460]   Back to the story of the feeding of the 5,000.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.660]   It was around Passover.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:41.780]   Passover was remembering when God saved Israel from the Egyptians, from Pharaoh.
[00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.300]   And what happened was the angel of death was going to come.
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:57.860]   And Jesus and God said, if you paint your door as a sign that the blood has been shed
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:07.180]   and you paint your door, the angel of death will cross over, will pass over, and you will
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.380]   be saved and you will be spared.
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:18.460]   And Jesus said to these people as they were thinking about Passover, where will we buy
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.740]   bread and what does it cost?
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:33.180]   And Jesus probably when he was speaking this, he himself knew that the cost would be himself
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.820]   on the cross.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:42.340]   The lamb that was shed, the blood that had to be painted on our doors, he himself is
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:45.460]   the one that saves us.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:49.460]   He took the punishment on the cross.
[00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:57.580]   And so I want to invite you today, maybe you've come on this service for the first time or
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:05.020]   maybe it's the hundredth time, but you haven't asked Jesus into your life to be your Lord
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.960]   and Savior.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.580]   Would you come to the altar of the Lord and receive him now?
[00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:18.460]   I'm going to say a prayer and it's going to ask Jesus into your life.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:26.020]   It's going to ask Jesus to help you to become who he has made you to be.
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:34.300]   And it's also a prayer that will confess Jesus as the Lord and Savior, the bread of life,
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:38.340]   who died and rose again for our sins.
[00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:44.900]   If you would like to pray this prayer, close your eyes and let's pray this prayer together.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:49.900]   And then we will respond with the song, Come to the Altar.
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:50.900]   Repeat after me.
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:21:00.740]   Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for Jesus Christ.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:06.340]   I thank you that he is the bread of life.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:14.740]   I thank you that Jesus is proven enough and that he saves.
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:22.500]   And that on the third day, he rose again to conquer death.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:34.360]   I now invite Jesus to come into my life, to be my source of bread, living bread, the bread
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.860]   of life.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:44.820]   Wash me of my sins and make me the person you want me to be.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.380]   In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:57.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
