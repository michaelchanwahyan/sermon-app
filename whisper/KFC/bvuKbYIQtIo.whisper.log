[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.040]   Once again, it's been an amazing series, hasn't it been?
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.520]   The Women of the Old Testament.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.280]   And we went through so many different women.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.480]   And each of them have their own struggle.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.160]   Each of them have their own story.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.320]   Each of them have their own faith in God
[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.800]   and sometimes some doubt.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.360]   And so today we are gonna go through the book of Ruth.
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.560]   And so read with me as we read the first verse,
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.200]   first verses together.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.360]   One, two, three.
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.720]   In the days when the judges ruled,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.000]   there was a famine in the land.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.680]   And a man of Bethlehem and Judah,
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.840]   who sojourned in a country of Moab,
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.080]   he and his wife and had two sons.
[00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.640]   The name of the man was Elimelech,
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.320]   and the name of his wife, Naomi.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.640]   And the names of his two sons were Malon and Chilion.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.280]   They were Ephratites from Bethlehem in Judah.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.320]   They went to the country of Moab and remained there.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.680]   So the story starts off.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.360]   And the writer tells us, what time is it?
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.780]   What's happening during this time?
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.120]   These are the times of judges.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.180]   And so Israel had not had kings yet.
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.880]   They had something called judges.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.760]   And these were leaders that were appointed by the Lord
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.560]   to lead them sometimes in times of battle,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.880]   sometimes to lead them spiritually and with prophecy.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880]   And so we see this family here,
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.560]   Elimelech and his wife, Naomi.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.120]   And something happens, right?
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.800]   They move to a different country.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.360]   They move to Moab.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.380]   And their intention, it says here, sojourn.
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.360]   It means that they didn't intend to stay there permanently,
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.200]   but they tended to just stay there for a while.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.280]   And so I'm gonna explain this story in seven episodes.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.160]   And the first episode is this, the famine menace.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.100]   There's a threat, a famine has appeared.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.620]   Why would you leave from your home to another country?
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.280]   It must have been so bad to a point where you said,
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.680]   we can't stay here any longer.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.080]   We can't survive here.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.440]   We gotta leave.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.280]   And so they made this decision.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.780]   And so they left the promised land.
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.600]   But isn't it that God said this was the land
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.920]   flowing of milk and honey?
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.780]   It's interesting.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.720]   It's quite interesting.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.600]   And so we see here this family moves from Bethlehem
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.480]   across the Jordan River to Moab.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.080]   And some people think, well, maybe they're disobeying God.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.400]   Right, maybe they're disobeying God.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.800]   How could you go out from the promised land,
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.140]   the will of God for your people?
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.500]   When it also mentions in the Bible that the promise is
[00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.280]   if Israel obeys the Lord,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.840]   then this land would prosper.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.200]   And so possibly Israel was disobeying God at this time,
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.200]   and that is why the Lord was punishing them with a famine.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.780]   And we see this throughout the world, right?
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.680]   When there is something happening in your country,
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.360]   could be a famine, it could be a war,
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.400]   what happens to these families?
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.840]   They move.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.000]   And we're seeing that.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.520]   Syria, there's a huge war, and these people think
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.080]   we can't survive here any longer.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.360]   And they move.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.240]   And this is what happened to this family.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.080]   The head of this family was Elimelech,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.160]   and his name meant God is king.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.280]   And yet, does he live as if God is king of his life?
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.940]   As if he's trusting in God to provide?
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.840]   That's one of the questions the commentaries sometimes pose
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.640]   and question whether they're leaving God's plan.
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   And we see here Naomi, her name means pleasant or lovely.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.040]   And so episode one, the famine menace.
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.040]   Episode two, tragedy strikes back.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.880]   Read with me.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.680]   But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi died,
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.680]   and she was left with her two sons.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.520]   These took Moabab wives, and named one of them was Orpah,
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.840]   and the name of the other was Ruth.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.280]   And they lived there about 10 years.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.320]   Both Malion and Chilion died,
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.680]   so that the woman was left without her two sons
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.880]   and her husband.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.320]   Wow.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.480]   Famine strikes, you move.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.680]   You're hoping for a better place, right?
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.560]   This must be a better place.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.640]   But what happens?
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.300]   Your husband dies, the head of your family.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.360]   And then what happens after that?
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.540]   Your two sons die as well.
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.300]   They were just gonna stay there for a couple years, right?
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.860]   It ends up to be 10 years.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.100]   10 years.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:56.060]   And what happens is that these women are childless widows.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.900]   Childless widows.
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:06.860]   What do you think it meant to be a childless widow
[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.940]   in the ancient Near East?
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.700]   Was it a position of power and wealth, or was it?
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.380]   No.
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.020]   Women didn't have the same rights you guys do
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.100]   to buy property and all that good stuff, right?
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.100]   Back then, widows, they depended on a male.
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.180]   A male to help them, right?
[00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.140]   To have land, to have protection.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.660]   And so because they didn't have that,
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.700]   these childless widows were considered the poorest people
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.380]   in the ancient Near East.
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.100]   They depended on the generosity of others.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:55.060]   And we see here Orpha, her name means back of the neck
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.260]   or stiff neck, and Ruth, it means friend.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.280]   It means friend.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.220]   What would you do if you were Naomi?
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.420]   Imagine yourself in her shoes.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.700]   You've basically lost everything.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.100]   You're like Job.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:18.460]   Imagine the people you love most in your life,
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.860]   and they've died.
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.420]   What would you do?
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.940]   What would you do?
[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.500]   You've hit rock bottom.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.500]   You're without your treasured family members.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.460]   You're considered poor, without protection.
[00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.900]   What would you do?
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.540]   Has anybody been rock bottom before?
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.660]   Have they?
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.060]   Yeah, some people, good.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.100]   Not good, I mean.
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.220]   Good that you understand me, I mean, yes.
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:06.540]   Episode three, the faith awakens.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.740]   The faith awakens.
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.060]   Read with me.
[00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.140]   Then she arose with her daughters-in-law
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.860]   to return from the country of Moab,
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.180]   for she had heard of the fields of Moab,
[00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.980]   that the Lord had visited the people and given them food.
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.060]   So she set out from a place where she was
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:27.700]   with her two daughters-in-law,
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.660]   and they went on their way to return to the land of Judah.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.300]   But Naomi said to her daughters-in-law,
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.020]   "Go, return each of you to her mother's house.
[00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.400]   "May the Lord deal kindly with you
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.540]   "as you have dealt with the dead and with me."
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.340]   So she hears, you know, and I don't know
[00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.500]   what she was doing in the field.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.660]   Maybe she was working the field.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.140]   Maybe she was gathering some wheat,
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.540]   leftover wheat or whatnot.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.980]   But she hears, "The Lord is doing something.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.820]   "I've lost everything in this land.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.980]   "What are my options?"
[00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.500]   Well, maybe there's no option left.
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.720]   It's time to go home.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:12.900]   It's time to go home.
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:17.900]   And so she takes sort of a step of faith to go home.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:23.740]   She's walking on her way, right,
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.340]   with her two daughters-in-law.
[00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.700]   You know, when you walk in the streets of Hong Kong,
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.860]   it's very safe, right?
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.080]   Do you fear for your life?
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.660]   You don't.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.540]   You don't.
[00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.840]   Hong Kong is one of the safest places to be at.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.380]   You know, I've traveled a lot,
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.060]   and I've gotta say, I don't worry about, you know,
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.720]   my bag getting stolen or whatnot.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.340]   I feel safe in Hong Kong.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.020]   Imagine three childless widows
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:00.020]   traveling back along the way by themselves.
[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.820]   We've heard Jesus' parable before, haven't we,
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.460]   of the good Samaritan, right?
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.700]   People robbed.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.460]   You know, there's no real borders like we have today
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.940]   and protection of laws and whatnot.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.540]   Who knows what could have happened?
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.740]   So she took a step of faith.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:22.820]   I hear God is doing something.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.020]   Let me go.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.220]   And as she goes along the way,
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.140]   she stops and she's like,
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.300]   my daughter's-in-law.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:38.860]   There's no point for you to follow me.
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.420]   It's better for you to just go back.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.380]   And this was her reasoning, right?
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.940]   You can go back to your home.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.860]   You belong in Moab, right?
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.500]   These are your people, your family,
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.660]   and you can go and find a new husband.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:53.780]   And that'd be great.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.140]   You know, you have somebody to protect you,
[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.380]   provide for you.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.300]   It's gonna be awesome.
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.820]   Go find another husband.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.940]   And she's like, why are you following me?
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.300]   I'm too old to find another husband, right?
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.500]   If I got married today, you know,
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.940]   maybe she's like 60,
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.140]   and I get married today and I have a child,
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.780]   you know, God blesses me on my wedding night, you know?
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.860]   Careful, careful, John says.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.980]   60s young, sorry, 60s young.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:27.060]   I mean, yeah, who knows with technology nowadays?
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.220]   Maybe they had better technology back then.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.940]   If God blesses me and I have a child tonight,
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:36.220]   you know, are you gonna wait for my child,
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.180]   my sons to grow up?
[00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.980]   And then you're gonna marry them?
[00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:43.700]   That's her reasoning, right?
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.380]   It's just like, there's no point for you to follow me.
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.980]   You have a family and you have potential
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.020]   to restore your lives.
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:12:01.940]   And so what would you do if you were Orpha and Ruth?
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.700]   Go talk to the people beside you.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.100]   What would you do if you were Orpha or Ruth?
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.020]   Would you follow Naomi?
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.060]   Go back or would you go back home?
[00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.620]   Go, discuss, come on, couple seconds.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.660]   30 seconds.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.260]   Life decision in 30 seconds, go.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:32.220]   Okay, all right.
[00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.020]   If you were these daughters-in-law,
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.620]   who would go back home?
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:39.220]   Raise your hand.
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.740]   Who would go back home?
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.580]   All right, I see maybe 1/3, 1/3.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.900]   Are you sure?
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.540]   Final answer?
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.220]   Final answer, okay.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.580]   You win a million dollars, I'm joking.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.540]   Honestly, if I was the daughter-in-law,
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.500]   it would logically make more sense for me to go back.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:05.820]   Yeah, go back, head back, yes, head back.
[00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.220]   Right, that's where my family is.
[00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.540]   They can offer me some protection.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.340]   They can maybe provide and arrange another marriage
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:15.700]   or whatnot.
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.380]   That would make sense.
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.380]   And in fact, that is what Orpha decides to do.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:25.900]   Orpha decides, oh no, no, I'll go with you, Naomi.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.540]   Ruth says, I'll go with you too.
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.540]   But then Naomi insists, no, no, go, go.
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:32.460]   It's better.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.020]   And so Orpha leaves.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.020]   And then Ruth is just still standing there.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:42.820]   And Naomi's like, Ruth, what are you doing?
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.900]   Go follow.
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.300]   Follow Orpha, go back, just like her.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.980]   But she says this.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.100]   Let's read it together.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.020]   She says this.
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.460]   It's a very famous God, famous quote here.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.860]   Not famous God.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.740]   Verse 15, see, your sister-in-law has gone back
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.260]   to her people and to her gods.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.860]   Return after your sister-in-law.
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.220]   But Ruth said, do not urge me to leave you
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.660]   or to return from following you.
[00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:15.340]   For where you go, I will go.
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.140]   And where I lodge, I will lodge.
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.900]   Your people shall be my people.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.500]   And your God, my God.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.060]   Where you die, I will die.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.260]   And there will I be buried.
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:32.180]   May the Lord do to me and more also to anything
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:37.020]   that put death apart, parts, death parts me from you.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:38.940]   Wow.
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.980]   This is the statement Ruth makes.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.700]   Your God will be my God.
[00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.620]   Your people will be my people.
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.660]   This woman leaves everything.
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:15:01.260]   Her family, her friends, her home, her religion,
[00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.700]   her chance of remarriage because her faith awakens.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:15.300]   There's a supernatural awakening of her faith.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.180]   She had no reason to believe this other religion,
[00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.700]   this other gods.
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.820]   She's probably never been to Israel or to Bethlehem.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:30.780]   But somehow there's a faith that awakens inside of her
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:32.900]   and potentially what happens is,
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.700]   you know, Naomi has set such a great example
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.660]   and they have such a great relationship
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.260]   that she doesn't want to leave her.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:46.140]   We don't know exactly,
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:50.180]   but we can maybe take an educated guess.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:55.180]   And so these two women go back to Jerusalem,
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.420]   to Bethlehem.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.420]   And it's like seeing old friends after 10 years.
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.980]   Have you seen your high school friends
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.220]   after a couple of years?
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.500]   Oh, what are you up to?
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:11.860]   You know, what's going on?
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.340]   And they're the talk of the town, right?
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.380]   It says here the whole town was stirred
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.380]   and they say, is this Naomi?
[00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.420]   Is it you?
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:26.420]   Maybe she's 10 years, you know.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.300]   Who knows what I'll look like in 10 years,
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.580]   maybe younger, I'm joking.
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:40.460]   I'm growing my hair.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:47.100]   She changes her name.
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.580]   Why does she change her name?
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.860]   She says, don't call me Naomi.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:01.860]   Call me Mara, for the Lord has dealt bitterly with me.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:05.380]   What did her name mean before?
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:12.620]   Lovingly, pleasant, and now it's turned purple.
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.580]   And green to bitterness.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.700]   So dramatic.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.820]   I mean, I didn't even set that up myself.
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.500]   Back then, they would only change their name
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.180]   from Abram to Abraham,
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:37.660]   from Jacob to Israel.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:42.660]   After they had a great change of experience
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.620]   or an encounter with God.
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:51.700]   And so you can imagine the state that she was at.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.620]   Rock bottom.
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:18:00.180]   Episode five, a new hope.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.260]   A new hope.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.100]   And we're gonna see that they're gonna devise a plan.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:13.700]   Trust God's providence and end with praise.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.180]   Read with me.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.220]   Now Naomi had a relative of her husband's,
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.140]   a worthy man of the clan of Elimelech,
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.100]   whose name was Boaz.
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.020]   And Ruth and the Moabite said to Naomi,
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.260]   let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain.
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.020]   After him, whose sight I shall find favor.
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.540]   And she said to her, go, my daughter.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:45.220]   So they go back?
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.220]   They could have just sat there and begged for food
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.780]   and no, they didn't.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.060]   Ruth was hardworking.
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.460]   She was like, I'm determined.
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.460]   I wanna do something about it.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:19:00.060]   We may be poor, we may be rock bottom.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.140]   Nobody is protecting us, standing up for us,
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.100]   but no, I wanna do something about it.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.580]   And so she was willing to give up her time
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.940]   for her mother-in-law.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.020]   And so she goes and gleans in the field.
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.140]   Gleaning is what?
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.900]   We can see in this next picture,
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.700]   it's picking up the extra pieces of wheat or barley
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.380]   that the reapers didn't get.
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:32.380]   And in fact, that was actually an instruction from the Lord
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:38.140]   that you should help the poor and the widows
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.300]   by allowing them to glean in your fields,
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:43.340]   pick up the scraps.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.500]   And so she's, you know, la la la la la,
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:47.540]   I'm gonna go glean.
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.380]   You know, I love barley.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:50.780]   You know, she's, I don't know,
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.500]   like just hopping around.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.660]   There's a bounce in her step.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.340]   You know, she sees the fields.
[00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:59.140]   It's like, it's harvest time, wow.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.780]   Let's go pick up some barley.
[00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:05.860]   Gleaning, you know, is her new hobby.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.740]   You know, she goes and she stumbles upon the field
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.140]   of this man named Boaz.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.060]   It just so happens.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:16.340]   Like, wow.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.260]   Providence.
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.260]   And who is this man?
[00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.020]   Well, Boaz is actually a relative,
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.980]   a relative of Elimelech.
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.780]   And so here we see a classic story.
[00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.020]   Boaz, boy meets girl.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:41.340]   Who's this new girl in my school?
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.300]   Oh, where is she from?
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.620]   Oh, she's from, I don't know, Toronto.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.580]   I don't know.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:56.700]   Oh, what's her family situation like?
[00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.540]   Ah, I see, I see.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.500]   Okay, that's interesting.
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.420]   Let's invite her to a meal.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:08.340]   I'm interested in this new girl, right?
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.780]   And then what does Boaz do?
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.020]   Boaz tells the reapers, oh, just by the way,
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.900]   leave some extra barley along the way
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.900]   so that this girl could be provided for.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.900]   Boy meets girl.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:29.900]   Boy meets girl.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:35.020]   And so, you know, Ruth is so excited.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:36.420]   You know, she goes back home,
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.620]   she brings some of the barley she's collected
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.740]   and some of the extra food that she's got
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.300]   from the meal with Boaz.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.020]   And Naomi, you know, she's been, I don't know,
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.700]   cleaning up the house the whole day.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.940]   And she's like, hey, Ruth, what are you up to?
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:56.300]   You look like God has blessed you.
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.300]   Who have you met?
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.820]   Where have you gleaned?
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.780]   You know, it's like your mom, you know?
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.380]   When you come home, oh, where did you go today?
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.540]   How you doing?
[00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.380]   How's school?
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.260]   How's work?
[00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.340]   That's like your mom, right?
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.980]   And this is what Naomi does.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.940]   And Naomi learns that she's gleaned where?
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.900]   In the fields of Boaz.
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.300]   And then they are like, wow, that's so cool.
[00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.540]   This man is a close relative of ours.
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.820]   Whoa, that's so cool.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.260]   What are the chances?
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.580]   I mean, I live in Bethlehem.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.260]   There can't be that many people, right?
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.260]   And he's one of our redeemers.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.260]   And they're like, wow, Naomi's like praising God.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.100]   Wow, it's amazing.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.300]   Plan, providence, praise.
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.740]   And we see here, what is a redeemer?
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.740]   Any ideas what a redeemer is?
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:55.180]   Anybody have a redeemer in their life?
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.180]   It's a trick question.
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.380]   You should all say yes, but yes, yeah, I know.
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.340]   What are the responsibilities of a redeemer back then?
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.940]   Firstly, avenging the death of a murdered relative.
[00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:12.940]   Next, you're supposed to marry a childless widow
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.940]   of a deceased brother.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:20.940]   So if your brother is married and he dies,
[00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:26.220]   you have sort of the responsibility or the privilege
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.580]   to marry your brother's wife.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.140]   Anybody would like to do that?
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.660]   George?
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:34.140]   No, I'm joking, George.
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.220]   Redeemer.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.180]   Redeemer.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:45.340]   You also had the privilege of buying back land
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.380]   that had been sold.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.460]   Maybe you sold it for whatever reason,
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.700]   and this is what the redeemer does.
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.180]   And also, buying back a member who has been sold to slavery.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.180]   And also, you're to take care of the needy and the helpless.
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:03.980]   This is the responsibilities of a redeemer.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.460]   And they, Ruth just so happened
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.700]   to go into the fields of Boaz, a wealthy man,
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:17.180]   honorable man, upright, generous.
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.020]   Wow.
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:24.340]   Episode six, the return of Ruth.
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.860]   The return of Ruth.
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:31.740]   Once again, we see this same strategy,
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.740]   or same sequence.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:42.740]   They make a plan, we see providence,
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:45.500]   and then we wait for the praise.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.820]   So let's read together.
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.020]   One, two, three.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.020]   Then Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her,
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:56.300]   "My daughter, should I not seek rest for you,
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.200]   "that it may be well with you?
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:03.080]   "Is not Boaz our relative, with whose young women you were?
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.640]   "See, he is winnowing barley tonight at threshing floor.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.600]   "Wash, therefore, and anoint yourself,
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.160]   "and put on cloak, and go down to the threshing floor.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.460]   "But do not make yourself known to the man
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.180]   "until he had finished eating and drinking.
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.920]   "But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.920]   "then go and uncover his feet and lie down,
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.120]   "and he will tell you what to do."
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.940]   And she replied, "All that you say, I will do."
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:35.280]   So they make a plan.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.480]   Somehow, Naomi has this plan.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.680]   Instead of wearing your widow clothes,
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.680]   now get dressed up, right?
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.360]   Put on this cloak, put on this new dress,
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.680]   and then anoint yourself.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.360]   It's just like, put on makeup.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.660]   Instead of saying you're a widow and you're mourning,
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.600]   say, "Now you're available.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.980]   "You're single, and you're ready to mingle.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.960]   "Let Boaz know.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.560]   "Let George know.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.120]   "Let George know."
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:21.040]   And so where does this happen?
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.320]   Well, it happens in a place where they're
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:30.240]   separating barley from the straw.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.860]   What a romantic place.
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:38.680]   So somehow there's a plan
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:44.000]   that Boaz is gonna drink and eat,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.400]   and he's gonna fall asleep.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.640]   We don't know why he's there.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.360]   Usually, you know, upright, you know, not upright.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.080]   I mean, usually rich people,
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.560]   they have other people doing this.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.440]   Why is he doing it?
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.640]   We don't know.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.680]   But somehow, it's providence.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.920]   And he's there, he drinks, he eats,
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.000]   and he falls asleep, and here comes Roof.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.560]   Is he asleep?
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.560]   We don't know.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.760]   He's asleep now, yes.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.720]   We don't know.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   ♪ Da da da da da da ♪
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.280]   And he's sleeping, maybe he's snoring,
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.240]   and he uncovers, she uncovers his feet.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.500]   I don't know, maybe they get cold feet back then.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.940]   Or maybe, I don't know, cold feet.
[00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:39.880]   And so they have cold feet, and he wakes up.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.200]   You know, wow, my feet is so cold.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.120]   What's happening here?
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   Who is this woman?
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.640]   It's pitch black, who are you?
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.000]   And then Boaz is like, who are you?
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.040]   You know, what are you doing here?
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.160]   And Roof is like, I am Roof.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.960]   I need a redeemer.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.680]   Will you be my redeemer?
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.800]   It says here, who are you?
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.000]   And she answered, I am Roof, your servant.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.880]   Spread your wings over your servant,
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.480]   for you are a redeemer.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.520]   She's saying, I need help.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.840]   Will you redeem me?
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.120]   And what does Boaz say?
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.640]   May you be blessed by the Lord, my daughter.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.780]   You have made this last kindness greater
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.660]   than the first that you.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.040]   Have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich,
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:32.440]   and now, my daughter, do not fear.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.040]   I will do for you all that you ask,
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:39.900]   for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a worthy woman.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.600]   And now, it is true that I am a redeemer,
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.760]   yet there is another redeemer nearer than I.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.040]   Remain here, I'm gonna sort it out tomorrow.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.480]   Boaz blesses her.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.880]   May the Lord grant you favor.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:04.820]   Roof is a worthy, upright, honorable woman.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:10.160]   And he says, I'm willing to redeem.
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.880]   Take up this task.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.620]   Get ready, George.
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:22.080]   Episode six, the rise of the redeemer.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:24.200]   The rise of the redeemer.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.440]   So what happened back then?
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.200]   Well, they would usually go to the town gate
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.560]   or something like that, and they would meet, right?
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.160]   And they would have 10 witnesses,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.720]   'cause that's how things are passed officially,
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.960]   with witnesses.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.280]   And so Boaz goes and meets the redeemer
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.720]   that is closer to Limelech and Ruth,
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.080]   and they're compromising.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.040]   Hey, how you doing?
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.720]   Good to meet you, handshake.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:52.360]   And hey, let me tell you, there's Naomi and Ruth,
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.080]   and they're back, and you are the closest relative.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.000]   Congratulations.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.520]   Do you wanna redeem them?
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:04.120]   And the guy's like, yeah, I wanna redeem them.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.360]   You know, it's awesome.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.180]   I can help them restore their land
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.900]   and also help protect them.
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:10.800]   It's gonna be great.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.160]   I will redeem it.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.120]   And then Boaz is like, bet, if you redeem them,
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.560]   you will also have to marry a Moabite.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:23.200]   And he's like, I cannot redeem.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:27.240]   This I cannot do, for whatever reason.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.760]   We don't know exactly.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.040]   Maybe he was already married,
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.580]   or he had other things going on.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.000]   And so I can't redeem it.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.120]   You redeem it.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.420]   And so they had this, I don't know,
[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:45.420]   sandal flipping contest to say, it's official.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.500]   Instead of signing, they just throw sandals
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.580]   at each other or something.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.420]   I don't know.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.100]   That was, it's official.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.720]   I threw my sandal at you.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:31:01.300]   And so Boaz becomes the redeemer for Ruth and Naomi.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.340]   Let's give a hand.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:07.340]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.340]   (audience applauding)
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.300]   She's redeemed.
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:14.140]   And we see in these times of judges,
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.640]   you know, this whole story,
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.600]   the famine that came, the tragedy that struck,
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.120]   the faith that awakens, the hope that comes
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.020]   when they meet Boaz, the return of Ruth
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.420]   as she goes and sort of proposes.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.300]   And then the rise of the redeemer.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.100]   And it all leads towards this one last thing.
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:42.860]   The last redeemer.
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:45.940]   The last redeemer.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:47.140]   JP's loving it.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.940]   JP's loving it.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.660]   Let's read together.
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.820]   So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.700]   When he made love to her, the Lord enabled her to conceive,
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.220]   and she gave birth to a son.
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.820]   The woman said to Naomi, praise be to the Lord
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:10.740]   who this day has not left you without a guardian redeemer.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:14.220]   May he become famous throughout Israel.
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.500]   He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.660]   for your daughter-in-law who loves you
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:25.660]   and who is better to you than seven sons has given birth.
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:31.040]   Then Naomi took the child into her arms and cared for him.
[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:36.180]   The woman living there said, Naomi has a son.
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.580]   And they named him Obed.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:43.580]   And he was the father of Jesse and the father of David.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.860]   Wow.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.940]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.340]   The first thing that's amazing
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:56.700]   is that God uses a Moabite woman
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.000]   to accomplish his plan.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   A widow, poor, looked down upon in society.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.880]   And God uses her to accomplish his plan.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:16.360]   And what is his plan?
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.440]   His plan was not just for us to be redeemed
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.200]   in our poor situation,
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.040]   in our tough trials,
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:34.520]   but God's plan was for us to be redeemed.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:41.520]   And God's plan was for us to be redeemed.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   And God's plan was for us to be redeemed.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:53.520]   And God's plan was for us to be redeemed.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.520]   And God's plan was for us to be redeemed.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.000]   He sustains the world.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.440]   And he had in mind that this Moabite woman
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:12.520]   would be part of God's overarching plan
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:15.680]   for the redemption of mankind.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:23.320]   And we know God made a covenant with David
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:30.760]   that his descendant would be on the throne forever.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.080]   His throne would be established forever.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.440]   And that was accomplished by the last redeemer.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:44.360]   The redeemer that we need, who saves us.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.960]   God has a plan.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.800]   This story started with death and tragedy.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.200]   And it ended with life and birth.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.800]   It was empty hopelessness.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:02.080]   And it turned full and hopeful.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.120]   Naomi thought she was going back to die.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.200]   That God gave her new hope.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.600]   And this last redeemer
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.680]   doesn't just redeem us from our poor situation
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.520]   or whatever trials we go through.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   He redeems us from spiritual death to spiritual life.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:32.920]   From sin and slavery to becoming slaves of righteousness.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:38.800]   From spiritually poor to now we are spiritually rich.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:45.480]   Because we share in the inheritance with Jesus Christ.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:50.080]   What an amazing father.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.960]   God is an amazing father.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:56.720]   His plan for us is amazing.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:00.400]   It's Father's Day.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.000]   And I wanna talk about my father.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.880]   My father is a pastor in Toronto.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.520]   He's a good friend of Pastor Lamb.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.160]   That's how we met.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:17.240]   And that's how I came to be here.
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.240]   My dad is an amazing person.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.920]   He's so disciplined.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.320]   He runs every morning.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.840]   He's super disciplined.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:29.960]   He's so passionate in sharing the gospel.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.960]   He's so hardworking.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.680]   But what I love most about my father
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:43.880]   is that he is always there for me when I need it the most.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.000]   In the darkest of times when I went through
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.080]   some big trials and struggles on my own,
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:57.040]   he embraced me in his arms.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.440]   In the midst of really hard times
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   and maybe even some mistakes I made,
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.080]   he stood up for me.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.160]   He was there.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:14.680]   He was there for me.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.280]   He was there for me.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:24.280]   Always dependable, always there.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.200]   A man of his word.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:33.280]   I'm blessed to have a father like him.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:40.000]   And maybe all of us don't have such a father,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.760]   but let me tell you something.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.840]   There are people in this congregation
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:49.760]   that love you, that care about you,
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.200]   and are there for you.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:58.200]   And we, we are here for you.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:03.080]   And we can only do what God allows us to do
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.720]   to the best of our ability.
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:12.040]   And so I wanna conclude with these three things
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.320]   that God really wants us to work on.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.640]   God uses all people.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   Jew, Gentile, women, men, widows, rich.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:28.320]   God uses all people.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.360]   And we need to find our identity in him.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   Not in what the world says,
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.040]   not in what the world says we should be
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.920]   or could be or shouldn't be.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.480]   We need to find our identity in Christ.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.080]   We need to have faith in his plan.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.040]   Do you have faith in God's plan?
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.600]   Do you have faith in God's plan?
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:59.680]   That not only does he want what's best for you,
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.000]   but he wants to save you for eternity.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.240]   He wants to save you for eternity.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.360]   You know, this life, it's temporary.
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:16.360]   This world has been corrupted by sin.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.280]   But God's plan is that one day in eternity,
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.520]   we will be with him forever.
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:26.160]   That is his plan, and that is our hope.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.240]   And during this time when we trust Jesus
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.800]   and we ask him into our life,
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.560]   he's working on our character
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.000]   so that we can become more like him.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:43.080]   More like Ruth and her trust in a God that is unknown.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.960]   Her hardworking attitude,
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.200]   laying herself down like a servant.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.200]   Boaz, Joe, who is generous, upright.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:59.440]   God wants to build our character
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.400]   to become more like Jesus, more like him.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.280]   Let's close our eyes as the band comes up.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.880]   And we're gonna sing this song.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:18.160]   It's called "Good, Good Father."
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.560]   Oh, not "Good, Good Father."
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:25.760]   The goodness of God.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:31.440]   Very good song.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.280]   And as we sing it,
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:39.800]   let's be reminded that God is here for us.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.040]   No matter what circumstance we are.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:49.320]   In poorness, in rich, in trial, in blessing,
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.160]   God is here.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.880]   Trust him that he has a plan.
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:59.600]   That he is good.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.840]   Let's stand and worship together.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:05.260]   together.
