[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.680]   Welcome to KFC Online.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.880]   It's great to have you with us.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.960]   And we haven't much in terms of notices tonight,
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.960]   but what we can tell you is that next Saturday the 24th,
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.480]   we will also be online and live streaming.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.640]   And obviously what we'll do is we'll keep you posted,
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:57.280]   we'll keep you in touch with developments here.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.080]   Basically everything this week is happening online,
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.380]   whether it be Bridge or Summer College Program,
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.240]   and indeed our service next Saturday.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.760]   Please stay safe, won't you?
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.720]   And now we're gonna pray for Hong Kong.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.440]   And I'm gonna ask Pastor Johnny to come and to pray for us
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.760]   and to introduce Michelle.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.640]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:24.040]   Let's take some time to just quiet our hearts
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:29.300]   and come before God and ask him for our help.
[00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:35.520]   That we could pray for our city and pray for Hong Kong.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.660]   Lord, we come before you and we know
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.080]   that there is this third wave in Hong Kong right now,
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.220]   that the infections are getting worse and worse,
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.060]   but we believe that God, you are with us,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.220]   that you are sovereign.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.180]   Lord, we ask that you would be with the medical staff
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.120]   and the team in the hospitals,
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.300]   that you would give them wisdom
[00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.140]   to know how to take care of the patients,
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.860]   you'd give them energy,
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.360]   give them knowledge of the virus and how to help people.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.540]   Lord, I pray that you give our leaders in this city
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.540]   wisdom to know how to contain it,
[00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:19.000]   the rules and the regulations that will follow
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.540]   to help slow the curve down.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:27.020]   Lord, we pray for the people in this city, Father,
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.700]   that they would be able to, yeah,
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.500]   be vigilant to wash our hands and keep our masks on
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.980]   and stay at home so that we can prevent this virus
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:40.000]   from getting worse and worse.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.460]   Lord, amongst, even though all these things are happening
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.260]   in the midst of this storm,
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.300]   we still want to praise you and worship you,
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.580]   that you are God over this virus,
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.020]   you're God over our city,
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.580]   you're God over our hearts.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:00.140]   And we want to acknowledge that you are God, Father.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.660]   And Lord, we want to pray for Michelle
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.500]   as she comes up and speaks your word.
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.020]   Lord, empower her through the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:13.580]   Bless her that the words that comes out
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.240]   will not go back void, Father, according to your word.
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.420]   Bless us, Lord, tonight as we listen to your word
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.740]   in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:32.260]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.660]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.700]   It's so glad, I'm so glad to be here
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.200]   to be speaking with you tonight.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.080]   Now, I just want to show you this.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.700]   I was gonna wear this tonight
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.700]   when you were all here to prevent the virus from spreading,
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.180]   but apparently you are now one screen away,
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.040]   so this will not be needed.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.020]   I will just put this on the side.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.640]   This is a situation where we're least expected,
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.820]   but we're glad that everybody is taking precautions.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.020]   So I'm really glad tonight to be speaking with you
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.140]   on a message on how we can partner with God.
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.700]   Now, I don't know about you,
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.580]   but I've been facing problems every now and then,
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.300]   and I think it's just part of life
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.340]   that we have problems and troubles.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:25.340]   But the thing is, how is it that we can partner with God
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.100]   so that he can help us in those situations?
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.760]   And for some of us, we might be going through a hard time
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.540]   because we have a relationship problem,
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.820]   or we might not be able to find a job,
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.660]   and we're having a financial problem.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.820]   And for other people,
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.440]   we might be having problems in our family,
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.900]   and every now and then we might come into a crisis,
[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.740]   and we just want to call out to God.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.900]   But how is it that we can work with God
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.080]   so that God can work through us
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.920]   and that we can see his miracles?
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.960]   So today, we're gonna find out the secrets
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.300]   on how to do that.
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.140]   Now, we're gonna be studying Judges,
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.300]   chapter four and chapter five.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.620]   Now, chapter four and five,
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:10.740]   they're actually telling the same story,
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:13.500]   except in chapter four, it's a narration.
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.200]   So it tells us a victorious battle
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.360]   that God has fought for the people of Israelites.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.600]   Now, chapter five is where Deborah, the judge at that time,
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.620]   sings a song of victory
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.200]   because of this great battle that God has performed.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.040]   So today, we're gonna look at both of them
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:34.520]   so that we can draw the details from both chapters
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.840]   and get the full picture.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.280]   Now, so it all started in chapter four,
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:43.740]   where we find that Israelites, again,
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.640]   the people there were doing things
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.120]   that were evil in the sight of the Lord.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.360]   And so the Lord gave them over to their enemies,
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.320]   the Canaanites.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.340]   And now there was a king called King Jabin,
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.280]   and he lives, now I think I'm gonna try to use this,
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.520]   he lives right here at Hazar, okay?
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.760]   He lives very north.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.000]   And now he has a commander, a military commander.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.800]   His name is Seseira,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.480]   and he lives right here in Haroshi Hagumi.
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.980]   And so what we find is that they are powerful
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:20.360]   because they have 900 chariots of iron
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.220]   and a very, very great army.
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:24.520]   Now, the Israelites,
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.900]   because the Lord has given them over to their enemies,
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.560]   has been oppressed by them for over 20 years now.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.680]   And so there were cruelties and they were oppressed
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.440]   in such a way that the roads all along here,
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.920]   they were robbers and that people would just take plunders
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.120]   from the Israelites.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.080]   And at the same time, the villages were no more,
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:51.520]   meaning that they were unwalled villages
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.920]   and people had no crops and had no agriculture at all.
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.760]   So that was a time of great oppression.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.600]   And what we find is that God has Deborah being the judge,
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.600]   and she sits here, there is a palm tree named after her.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.680]   It's called the Palm of Deborah.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.200]   And it actually is situated between Bethel and Ramah.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.960]   We're gonna find that these will actually come into play
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.980]   where the geographic of things are.
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.320]   So we're just gonna learn a little bit
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.480]   about where everything's happening.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.360]   So now in this situation,
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.800]   we find that for some reason, a woman was the judge.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.320]   And so she calls out to the Israelites military commander,
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.880]   and his name is right here.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.800]   So what is it that we, so Deborah here,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.200]   she calls out and she says,
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.240]   "Barak, you are our military commander, come.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.400]   "Come because I have a word that I need to tell you."
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.760]   And so let's read it together.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.920]   Here it says, "She sent and summoned Barak,
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.920]   "the son of Abinoam, and from Kadesh, Naphtali,
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.140]   "and said to him,
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.640]   "Has not the Lord, the God of Israel, commanded you?
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.720]   "Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor,
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.280]   "taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.000]   "and the people of Zebulun.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.140]   "And I will draw out Seseira, the general of Jabin's army,
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.460]   "to meet by the river Kishan
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.520]   "with his chariots and his troops.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.960]   "I will give him into your hands."
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.180]   Now from these two verses,
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.400]   we can see that it was all God's plan
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.520]   to deliver the people of Israelites.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.160]   And there was a great game plan.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:44.760]   I mean, if we look at this,
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.080]   we see that this area is where the battlefield would be.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.920]   And what we find is that Deborah tells him,
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.600]   "This is the game plan, okay?
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.680]   "God has it all written out for you.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.960]   "All you need to do is carry it out
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.880]   "because God already said
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.080]   "that he will give your enemies into your hands."
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.760]   And this is what they were supposed to do.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.320]   They were supposed to gather men from Naphtali and Zebulun
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.520]   and then travel to Kadesh.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.820]   And then they're gonna go to Mount Tabor
[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:17.400]   where they're gonna fight with Seseira,
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.040]   the general of the enemy,
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.640]   and they're gonna come here to this point
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:26.640]   where the Lord will give them over to the Israelites.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.320]   Now this all sounds great, right?
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.000]   So now if you are Barak, what would you be thinking?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.400]   "All right, I just got a word from God
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.040]   "and now I even got a confirmation from the judge, Deborah,
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.120]   "and she's also a prophetess.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.160]   "So I think it's gonna be a sure win.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.160]   "But somehow, Barak didn't really react like that.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.160]   "So let's read and see how he reacted."
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.480]   And he said, "If you will go with me, I will go.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.280]   "But if you will not go with me, I will not go."
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.680]   And she said, "I will surely go with you.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.240]   "Nonetheless, the road on which you're going
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.060]   "will not lead you to glory,
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.560]   "for the Lord will sell Seseira into the hand of a woman."
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.760]   So Deborah rose and he went with Barak to Kadesh.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.040]   Now what we find is that for some reason,
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.840]   even after the confirmation from God,
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.760]   it was not enough for Barak to take actions.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.780]   Now there is something very, very different
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.520]   about Deborah and Barak, right?
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.220]   We can find a few differences.
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.520]   One is a male, one is a female,
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.960]   and one is a military general,
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:38.920]   while the other one is a prophet and a judge.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.480]   And we find that there's also something very critical
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.440]   that sets them apart.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.080]   And do you know what that is?
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.100]   I can't really hear you from across the screen,
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.800]   but I'll give you the answer.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.780]   It is faith.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.360]   It is faith that sets them apart.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.960]   So I wanna bring us to a very first point,
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.600]   is that if we want to partner with God,
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.200]   if we want Him to be in our lives
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.160]   and help us with the situation that we're going through,
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.800]   we must have faith in God.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.620]   Now as we said earlier,
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.480]   we found out that Barak actually realizes
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.240]   what God's word was,
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.000]   but he thinks that it's not good enough.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   God's word alone for Barak was not good enough.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.120]   He needed more,
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.720]   and even a confirmation was not enough for him.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.520]   He needed even more.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.920]   What did he need?
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.000]   He needed something that he could see with his eyes.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.560]   He needed visual evidence.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.560]   Now on the other hand,
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.540]   we see that Deborah believes in God
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.520]   and believes in His words alone.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.600]   And she also risks her life,
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.280]   because when Barak says,
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.200]   "Will you go with me?"
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.060]   She said, "Okay, I'll go with you,
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.640]   "but you just won't get the glory."
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.920]   So she puts her life at risk for God's word.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:06.920]   And also, she doesn't need physical evidence.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.280]   Now what we notice is that there are these two people,
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:15.200]   one with faith, that's Deborah,
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.240]   Barak without,
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.440]   and we're asking ourselves,
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.440]   why is it that these two people
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.360]   under the same circumstances,
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.560]   they've been oppressed in the same ways,
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:28.080]   but one has faith and one doesn't?
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.800]   Because if we find out why,
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.160]   maybe it will also help us have faith.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.560]   'Cause we hear people talk about
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.520]   have faith in God all the time,
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.560]   but how is it that we can do it?
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.920]   Now the Bible doesn't specify,
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.440]   but we can look at the clues and find out
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.560]   what makes Barak not courageous
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:51.000]   and what makes Deborah having all this faith.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.400]   Now let's have a look,
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.280]   because in previous verses,
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:00.040]   we already saw that it said that the people of Israel,
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.760]   how did they do?
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:05.560]   They did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.920]   What else did they do?
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.080]   Because they did evil,
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.040]   the Lord sold them to their enemy, King Jabin.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.320]   And when the new gods were chosen,
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.160]   war was at gates.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.440]   So what is it that we realize is,
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.800]   Barak, who is part of the Israelite,
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.160]   has gone through this experience,
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.400]   where yeah, they prayed to God,
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.760]   but they were doing evil at that time.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.560]   And because they did evil,
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.720]   God gave them into their enemies.
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:38.200]   And so they've been experiencing this God
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.040]   that's not fighting for them,
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.600]   but they've been experiencing a God
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.160]   that seemed to be distant and leaving them alone.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.840]   And so what we find is that,
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.240]   Barak, having done evil,
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:56.560]   experiences a Lord that sells them to their enemies.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.160]   And because of that,
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:03.120]   they have no faith in God and his words.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.520]   Now on the contrary,
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.400]   we're gonna find that Deborah is not the same,
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.140]   even though they were under the same situation.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.080]   But remember, Deborah,
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.480]   she is actually a prophetess and a judge.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.640]   What that means was,
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.560]   she had access to the book of laws,
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.360]   and she would know what is it that God likes,
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.240]   and she would live by them.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.680]   Now how do we know that she lived by them?
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.340]   Well, let's see,
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:32.800]   remember how Barak reacted?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.840]   He actually said that,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.640]   "If you go with me, I will go."
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.360]   What is that saying?
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.760]   That's saying that Deborah has such a good reputation
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.520]   of God's presence with her,
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.280]   that he's willing to even risk his life.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.480]   So her reputation is telling us
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.400]   that she has been following God,
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.640]   and God's presence was apparent in her life.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.880]   And at the same time,
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.780]   we also saw from scripture
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.880]   that it actually told us
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.560]   that she was able to judge the men of Israel,
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.960]   and men and people of Israel were actually going to her.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.440]   So it means that because of the presence of God in her life,
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.440]   she was also able to teach people about who God was,
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.360]   and how they should live their life.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.340]   So in here, we also see that in chapter five,
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:29.340]   it says, "I, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel."
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.880]   Now what do mothers do?
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.640]   Mothers discipline their children,
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.520]   they bring them to the right path.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:39.100]   And so here we see that the reason that Deborah
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:43.240]   has so much faith is because she has been doing good,
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.200]   she has been doing things the way
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.320]   that God wanted the people to do.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.160]   And not only that,
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.320]   she teaches other people to do that
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.860]   when she judged for them.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.900]   And we also see because of that,
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.800]   the Lord has been with her,
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.760]   and it was apparent, so apparent,
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.160]   that people saw the presence of God in her life.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.600]   And because of that, she has faith in God.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.220]   And so faith is like a muscle that we have,
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.880]   that we can exercise.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.320]   And if we are also like Deborah,
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.480]   if we choose to be like her,
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.800]   we can also exercise our faith muscle.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.000]   And we can do that by following what God says.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.520]   And whenever we follow what God says,
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.600]   and God's goodness comes into our life,
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:33.360]   we actually gain more faith.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.000]   And if we store up so much faith,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.720]   that when crisis come into our lives,
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:43.720]   we would have enough faith to just believe in God's word.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:48.360]   And so from this we see the very first thing
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.120]   that we as partners of God need to do
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:54.780]   is to have faith through doing good.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.760]   Now, another thing that we looked at is,
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.600]   we haven't looked at,
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.080]   we're going to look at now,
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.400]   is that as they were moving north,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.240]   because Deborah was going with Barack,
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.480]   to north to have this battle.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.040]   We realized that in chapter five,
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.160]   it actually tells us that she calls on
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.480]   to the different tribes.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   Because as she moves from here, Ifram,
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.040]   all the way up to where the battlefield is,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.560]   that along the way,
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.960]   they were singing a song to let people know,
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.680]   come on out, come on out,
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.760]   because the Lord is fighting for us.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.880]   We need you, come on out.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:36.160]   But we realized that not all of them responded to God.
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   And not all of them responded to Deborah and Barack's song.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.680]   So I have highlighted for us
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.200]   that all of the one in Magneta,
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.520]   they're the ones that responded to their calling.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.440]   And the ones in blue are the ones that didn't.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.840]   And they were too busy tending their flocks,
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.200]   too busy fighting off other enemies,
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.800]   and or just simply for no reason.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.320]   And the Bible tells us so.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.280]   And so it brings us to our second point.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.680]   If we want to partner with God,
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.640]   the very thing that we need to do
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:16.000]   is we need to also take on our responsibilities.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.520]   Now we have responsibilities just like these tribes.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.880]   When God is fighting for us,
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.160]   we have a responsibility to react.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:30.160]   We have a responsibility to respond to his call of action.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:33.680]   Now, I know that a lot of times,
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.240]   we just want to sit on our couch
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.440]   and wait for God to do things for us.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.000]   But God is not here.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.240]   He's not in the business of cultivating
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.360]   a lot of lazy Christians.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.320]   But he is in the business of partnering with us.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:48.200]   Think about this.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.080]   I mean, God can just send a plague down,
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.020]   and immediately, all the enemies would be gone.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.640]   Why spend so much time gathering people?
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.000]   And it's not even a lot, it's 10,000 people.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.760]   So why is it that he's doing so much?
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.080]   It's because he wants our partnership.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.320]   How easy it would be for him to just do that.
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.520]   Now we have a Cantonese saying that
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.720]   when you go to someone for dinner
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.280]   and you want to bring something,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.840]   we usually bring a chicken or something
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.440]   for the dinner buffet, right?
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:26.280]   So there's a saying that someone will bring the chicken
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:29.100]   and I will bring the soy sauce, okay?
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.520]   Which means that this is pretty much what's happening.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.480]   Even though this is a partnership that we have with God,
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.280]   but really, he's bringing the chicken.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.760]   He's doing all the work,
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.480]   but he just wants us to participate, bring the soy sauce.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.480]   And so when we partner with him,
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.880]   it's important that we take on our responsibilities.
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.880]   And if we do that, we're gonna see God acting out for us.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:56.960]   And so this is a saying I really like,
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.960]   which is we can't do anything if God is not here,
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.880]   but God won't do anything if we're not here.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.120]   Okay, I'm gonna say that again.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.820]   We can't do anything if God is not here,
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:16.520]   but God won't do anything if we're not here,
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.440]   because God wants our partnership.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.800]   This is a relationship that we have with him.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.880]   And so the third thing that I wanna tell you
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.120]   is that while we partner with God,
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.920]   this is my favorite point, by the way.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.840]   My favorite point is the third point,
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.920]   because I get to see the salvation of the Lord.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.840]   This is the part where after we've put in our faith
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.320]   in what God said, and this is the part
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.880]   where we even took on our responsibilities
[00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.080]   and did what we were supposed to,
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:54.040]   God has the battle, and he's gonna deliver us,
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.720]   because he knew how the ending would be
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.140]   even before anything happened.
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:03.520]   So the third part for us to really partner with God
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.120]   is just to see how he's gonna save us,
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.960]   and it's so awesome to watch that.
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.600]   And in this situation where the tribes were fighting
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.940]   at the River of Kishon, what we find
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.500]   is that all of a sudden, even though
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.200]   the River of Kishon in that time of the year
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.820]   was a small stream, okay, but all of a sudden,
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.260]   there was a cloudburst in a month
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.940]   that rain was unheard of, and all of a sudden,
[00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:36.860]   the heaven rained, and what we find
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.620]   is that in this verse we see,
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.500]   from heaven, the stars fought.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:46.680]   From their courses, they fought against Cicera.
[00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:49.640]   The torrent Kishon swept them away.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.640]   The ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon,
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.020]   marching on my soul.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:57.380]   And so what we see here is that
[00:37:57.380 --> 00:38:01.060]   the Lord actually opened up the sky,
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.260]   and it started to rain in a season
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.660]   that rain was impossible, and not only
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.860]   like a few drops of rain, it was a torrent.
[00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:13.300]   It was enough that the ground that the chariots were on
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.780]   became muddy, and that the wheels
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.000]   were all stuck in the mud, and it can no longer go.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.580]   And so the Israelites were able to take the lives
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.500]   of those army and their enemies.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.220]   And so what we find here is that God
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.500]   is here to fight for us, because he loves us,
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.260]   and in any situation, he wants to be a part of our lives.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.860]   He wants to take care of our problems,
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.440]   but it's not all the time that we
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.000]   are actually partnering with him.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.900]   A lot of times, we're just on our own.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.380]   So I just want to share a quick story
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:52.260]   about an event that happened last week.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.540]   So last week, I was told, at least my mom tells me,
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.660]   that there's some family businesses
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.020]   that I need to take care of.
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.460]   And I was like, okay, well, this is not something
[00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.220]   that I really am looking forward to.
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:08.560]   The reason being is because the task required
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:11.380]   that I would need to talk to much older men,
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.940]   and they were a lot craftier than I was.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:17.300]   And I was definitely not looking forward to it.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.380]   And so I actually sat down,
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.980]   'cause I have two sisters, and they're not in Hong Kong,
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.940]   and so it's just me and my mom, all females.
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.420]   And so I was thinking to myself,
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.440]   all right, what kind of guy friends do I have?
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.140]   Maybe I'll ask that person to help.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.100]   Nope, maybe that person, nope.
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:36.980]   And so I went through a list of people,
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:39.500]   and I realized they didn't quite fit,
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.620]   as in it wasn't quite right for them to help me.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:48.540]   And so I suddenly remembered these two chapters,
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.300]   because I was also preparing for this sermon.
[00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.880]   And I asked myself, Michelle,
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.700]   what is it that you're depending on?
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:03.600]   Are you depending on human beings, people?
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.300]   Are you depending on people
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.660]   who are more skillful than you are?
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:11.680]   Or are you gonna depend on God and God alone?
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.620]   And I just remembered, I said, yes,
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.700]   of course, God and God alone.
[00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:17.860]   And suddenly I just started to remember
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.100]   that God loves me so much.
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.500]   Not that I forgot, but it was a very deliberate thought
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.780]   that God loves me so much that he's gonna provide for me.
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.340]   He's gonna open the ways for me.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.980]   And so the next day, even though I was a little bit scared,
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:37.380]   I texted the people that I needed to talk to,
[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.220]   and 'cause I thought I need to fulfill my responsibility.
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:46.220]   I need to do, I need to act in a faithful way
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.280]   after I know and have faith in God.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.340]   I still needed to do something.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:55.480]   So I texted them and we had a chance to meet up
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.140]   and negotiated on some terms.
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.200]   And surprisingly, I have to say surprisingly,
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.060]   that God delivered.
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.260]   He delivered just like the way he delivered
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:11.820]   the Israelites because they were supposed to be
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:16.820]   these old fox, but then they were like sheep somehow.
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:20.540]   And at the same time, they agreed to pretty much
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.380]   all the terms that I wanted to,
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:24.700]   which is very, very surprising for me.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:29.820]   So you see, the story actually didn't end here
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:33.300]   for the Israelites, but I wanted to use my story
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.740]   to share with you that when we put our faith there,
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:42.740]   when we also act on it, that God will open doors
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.200]   in a way that we least expected.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.140]   And when I say least expected,
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:52.660]   want us to continue on the story where we see
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:56.860]   that Seseira was actually one of the only men
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:59.520]   that got away from that event,
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.980]   when God gave them a victorious battle.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.020]   And he was the only one that ran away
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.100]   and he went to a tent.
[00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.700]   And this tent was owned by a lady called Jael.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:13.140]   Now Jael was actually supposed to be a family ally
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:18.140]   of the Kenyanites, but God used her in a way
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:25.060]   that helped the Israelites to get rid of this general.
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.340]   Now, how did he do it?
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.880]   So he asked, he asked Jael if he could take cover
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.560]   in refuge in her tent.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.480]   And so she says, yes, and she says,
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.880]   "Turn around so I can cover you with this rug."
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.160]   And then he asked, "Could I have some water?"
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.320]   And she says, "Yes, have some milk."
[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:47.200]   They were curdled milk.
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.960]   And then he says, "If anyone asks for me,
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.400]   "just say that there's no one here."
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.920]   And she's like, okay.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.680]   So she goes to her toolbox and she actually takes out
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   a peg and also a hammer.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.960]   Because in those days, women actually put up
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.720]   and they took down tents.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.640]   So she had these tools in her female toolbox.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.260]   And so she took it over and actually while he was sleeping,
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:15.600]   she has assassinated him.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:22.320]   And so what we find is that who would have imagined
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.520]   that the outcome of Seseira would be
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.820]   in a woman's hand other than God?
[00:43:30.820 --> 00:43:34.560]   And who would have thought that this turn of events,
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:38.960]   which seems so unpredictable and impossible to happen.
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.680]   And that's the point that I wanted to get,
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:47.680]   is that when we look towards God for the victorious battle,
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:52.600]   he will open the skies like he did for the Israelites,
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.000]   just for you.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.960]   And he's gonna have a chain of events
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:58.800]   that doesn't even make sense and it's impossible.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.320]   How would a female kill an assassin, a general?
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.320]   That's impossible.
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:08.400]   And yet she just took out some random tools
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.620]   and completed the job.
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:14.320]   So I just wanted to say that God loves us
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:17.800]   and he wants to help us with every single situation.
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:21.840]   And if we too will fight alongside with God,
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.880]   and if we will partner with him,
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.880]   putting our faith in him, exercising our faith muscles,
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:33.480]   and if we will take on the part that we are responsible for,
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:38.320]   we will see God delivering us in our situations.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.300]   Now, those situations may not happen
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:43.620]   exactly the way that we have hoped or we'd like,
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.080]   but we do know that God is in charge.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.600]   And if he is in charge, he's able to bring us
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.240]   to an outcome that is for us and not against us.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.360]   And so what does that mean for us today?
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.160]   Well, if we wanna train up our faith muscles,
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:03.840]   we can start off by remember what Deborah did.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:05.440]   She did good.
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:08.800]   And when she did good, she saw God and she got more faith.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:12.840]   And so we can just read a passage from the Bible each day
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.920]   or even a verse and we'll say, you know what?
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.880]   Father, I'm willing to follow that passage.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.440]   I'm willing to live that out today.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.480]   If it says, forgive your enemy,
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.000]   and I have someone I really hate from work,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.020]   I'm willing to do that.
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.880]   And if you say to forgive, and I'm fighting with my spouse,
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.020]   I'm willing to reconcile that day and that moment.
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.880]   And the more we do it, the more faith we build up.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:43.560]   And so when things happen,
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.200]   like maybe we're facing coronavirus now
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.080]   and we're very nervous about it,
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:50.760]   or maybe you're looking for a job now and you look out,
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.520]   you're like, this is the hardest time to find a job.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.200]   What shall I do?
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.300]   And in those moments, if we also act on it,
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.020]   take on our responsibilities,
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.440]   maybe we'll send out a resume every day.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:07.820]   Maybe we'll even write a unique cover letter for each one.
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:12.320]   Or maybe for those of us who want to protect ourselves
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.720]   from the virus, then we're gonna take
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.120]   as much precautions as we can.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.920]   And this is a time where when we take on the responsibilities
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:25.020]   and we do our best, we're gonna see God fighting for us.
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:29.560]   So friends today, I just wanted to encourage you
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:32.160]   because I've had so many instances
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.560]   where God and I partnered together.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.480]   And again and again, he delivered me.
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.920]   And I just wanted to say that he's no longer a God
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.480]   that's far away that I can't reach.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:50.160]   Through all these things that God and I have been together,
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.680]   actually, he's very, very close.
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.760]   He's so close to me that in each of my day,
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.440]   I can tell him my struggles and he would guide me
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:05.120]   to do what is good, what is good for me.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.880]   And so I just wanted to encourage you.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.460]   If you took nothing away today,
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.000]   that if there's one thing that can build your faith muscle,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   and that would be read a passage a day and act on it.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.960]   Build your faith so that when that faith grows to be so big,
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.460]   that you're able to believe in God's word
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:29.200]   in whatever circumstances that you have.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.760]   Maybe the circumstances that you're facing
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:35.560]   is as big as the 900 chariots of iron.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:39.560]   And maybe that thing has been with you for over 20 years
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:43.200]   and you can't seem to get rid of that problem.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.440]   But you know what?
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.360]   Our God is much more powerful than that.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.240]   He can take care of all those things.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.680]   He can open up the skies for you.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:57.120]   And he's willing to have this unexpected chain of events
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.380]   just to help you.
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:02.160]   So friends, really want to encourage you
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:03.960]   that we'll take faith in him.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:07.000]   So let us pray together for the God of the universe,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.440]   our friend to help us.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.440]   - Dear Heavenly Father, just want to thank you
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:18.120]   for being a God that never forsakes us.
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:22.480]   Even when we did not follow your ways, Father,
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:25.800]   you were compassionate and you would find ways
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:27.960]   to reach out to us again.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.580]   You would give people like Deborah,
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.600]   you would give the Bible to us.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:36.360]   You would give friends and church to bring us back
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:40.880]   so that even if we fell away from you, Father,
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.400]   that you would bring us back.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:46.680]   And so Father, today we just pray that you would help us
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.960]   to build our faith muscle so that we have so much faith
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.960]   in you that whenever we're faced with crisis and troubles
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.800]   in our lives, that we will not look onto those trouble,
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:01.960]   but we'll look onto you, God, and say that
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.960]   you're always our help, you're always our friend.
[00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:10.040]   Father, help us so that we can partner with you.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:13.600]   We just can't wait to see the works
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.320]   that you will do for us.
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.480]   Thank you, Father.
[00:49:16.480 --> 00:49:19.220]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:24.880]   - Let's respond in song.
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.820]   Whom shall I fear?
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:35.020]   You hear me.
[00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:39.340]   You hear me when I call.
[00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:42.780]   You are my morning song.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.060]   Though darkness fills the night,
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.820]   it cannot hide the light.
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:53.220]   Whom shall I fear?
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:58.740]   You crush the enemy
[00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:02.500]   underneath my feet.
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.740]   You are my sword and shield.
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:08.780]   Though troubles linger still,
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:12.820]   whom shall I fear?
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:18.980]   I know who goes before me.
[00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:22.300]   I know who stands behind.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.780]   The God of angel armies
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:29.180]   is always by my side.
[00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:32.620]   The one who reigns forever,
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:36.060]   he is a friend of mine.
[00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.540]   The God of angel armies
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.180]   is always by my side.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:47.220]   My strength.
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:52.100]   My strength is in your name,
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:55.460]   for you alone can save.
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.780]   You will deliver me.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.060]   Yours is the victory.
[00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:05.940]   Whom shall I fear?
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:11.780]   Whom shall I fear?
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:18.900]   I know who goes before me.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:22.300]   I know who stands behind.
[00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.660]   The God of angel armies
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:29.020]   is always by my side.
[00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:32.340]   The one who reigns forever,
[00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:35.700]   he is a friend of mine.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:39.060]   The God of angel armies
[00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.540]   is always by my side.
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:48.980]   And nothing formed against me shall stand,
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:55.460]   'cause you hold the whole world in your hand.
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:01.460]   I'm holding on to your promises.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:05.460]   You are faithful.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:09.460]   You are faithful.
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:14.460]   And nothing formed against me shall stand,
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:21.460]   'cause you hold the whole world in your hand.
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:28.460]   I'm holding on to your promises.
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:32.460]   You are faithful.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:35.460]   You are faithful.
[00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:38.460]   You are faithful.
[00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:47.460]   I know who goes before me.
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:50.460]   I know who stands behind.
[00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:54.460]   The God of angel armies
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.460]   is always by my side.
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:01.460]   The one who reigns forever,
[00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:04.460]   he is a friend of mine.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:08.460]   The God of angel armies
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.460]   is always by my side.
[00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:14.460]   I know who goes before me.
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:18.460]   I know who stands behind.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:22.460]   The God of angel armies
[00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:25.460]   is always by my side.
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:28.460]   The one who reigns forever,
[00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:32.460]   he is a friend of mine.
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:35.460]   The God of angel armies
[00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:38.460]   is always by my side.
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:42.460]   The God of angel armies
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:47.460]   is always by my side.
[00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:52.460]   Let's just take a few moments
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:56.460]   as we draw our service to a close.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:58.460]   We've sung those words,
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:01.460]   "I know who goes before me.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:04.460]   I know who stands behind.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.460]   The God of angel armies
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:11.460]   is always by my side."
[00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.460]   As Pastor Michelle told us,
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.460]   it's a partnership.
[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:22.460]   I just sense as if God is reaching out
[00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:25.460]   his hand to you,
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:29.460]   as it were beyond the computer screen.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.460]   He's saying to you now,
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:38.460]   "Will you take my hand?
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:43.460]   Will you come in partnership with me?"
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:48.460]   I don't know what you're going through in your life,
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:52.460]   but what I do know,
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:56.460]   if you would just reach out your hand tonight
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:55:00.460]   and take the hand of the one
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:04.460]   who is the God of angel armies,
[00:55:04.460 --> 00:55:10.460]   he is faithful.
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:14.460]   He will be faithful to you as he was to Deborah
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.460]   and the Israelites.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:22.460]   So let's pray together as we close the service.
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:29.460]   Father, I thank you for meeting us tonight.
[00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:35.460]   Lord, meeting us in that difficult situation.
[00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:39.460]   Meeting us in the things that we have to face.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:45.460]   Father, would you take my hand?
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:53.460]   Would you lead me to your side?
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:59.460]   May I know your presence with me
[00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:03.460]   tonight and always.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:07.460]   May the blessing of God Almighty
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:15.460]   Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:19.460]   be upon us and our loved ones
[00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:26.460]   this night and for always.
[00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:30.460]   My friends, thank you for joining us tonight.
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.460]   God bless you.
[00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.460]   Just remember this week,
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:37.460]   everything will be online,
[00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:43.460]   whether it be Klans or Bridge or SCP.
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:48.460]   And next Saturday, we'll be back live streaming here again.
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:53.460]   Please join us as we start to look at the story of Gideon together.
[00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:55.460]   God bless you.
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:56:57.460]   Stay safe.
