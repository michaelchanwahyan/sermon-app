1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,780
 Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,940
 Today is a special moment for me.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,760
 This is my first time preaching at KFC, my own spiritual home.

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,780
 But this could be the last time and the only time if I'm doing a poor job tonight.

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,760
 So I would like to take one minute of your time just to share a few words from my heart

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,600
 first before my sermon.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,940
 I really have to praise and thank God for his grace.

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,480
 Without his grace, I couldn't go through my study at the seminary for the past four years.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,400
 And can I tell you more about it later?

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:54,000
 I also want to thank my family and then my brothers and sisters who are watching online

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,600
 and some of them are here from my school, from the marketplace, from my small group,

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
 everywhere in the church.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,120
 Without your support, I couldn't go through this past four years as I walked through what

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,720
 I learned is my half time, that learning and discerning what God's will for me for my second

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,720
 half.

16
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
 So thank you.

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,080
 And then Pastor John was saying, I also want to thank my family, in particular, my wife,

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
 my two kids.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:33,360
 I remember four years ago when I first told them, "What do you think about your father,

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:42,840
 your husband being the only breadwinner, taking a few years off to go to seminary to study?"

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:50,520
 I remember what they tell me, is that, "If God calls you to do it, go ahead."

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,520
 And today, Pastor John just said, "It's my wife's birthday and on her birthday, she comes

23
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,960
 here instead of going to party, she comes here to support me."

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,440
 So that's what my family is for me.

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,440
 Thank you and happy birthday, my love.

26
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,400
 All right, back to my sermon.

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,600
 Last week, Pastor John preached to us the first part of this sermon, "Faith in the Workplace."

28
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,320
 And he told us this division between secular and sacred.

29
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,500
 Next slide, please.

30
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:42,380
 He called for a new breed of disciple and asked us to break down walls, build bridges,

31
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,780
 and seek God's will in the workplace.

32
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:57,400
 In this tonight, in this second part of this sermon, I want to invite you into a space

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:02,240
 to reflect on this topic from a different perspective.

34
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,620
 Me, I'm representing a layperson perspective.

35
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:13,020
 So tonight, I invite you to come here to reflect on this topic from a layperson perspective.

36
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:22,740
 Specifically, how do you feel about responding to this call for a new breed of disciples?

37
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:30,600
 This is also a call for all of us to enter into God's will to join Him for His kingdom

38
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,400
 work in transforming our city.

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,200
 Most of us, we have a full-time job, and I also include those full-time mom and dad as

40
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,140
 well.

41
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:53,600
 We are already so tired from our work, meeting demands from our managers, dealing with company

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:02,400
 politics, trying to outperform to get the next raise or get the next promotion.

43
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,800
 When we come to church, I just want to take a break from my work.

44
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:17,360
 I want to gain some energy from worship, from singing, from the sermon.

45
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,520
 I don't want to connect anything back from work here to church.

46
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,800
 I'm already so tired.

47
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:34,800
 Besides, I don't think my work matters here in God's kingdom.

48
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,040
 I remember a few weeks ago when Pastor James talked to us about a community-based church,

49
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,040
 and he challenged us to know each other more from a different perspective, knowing our

50
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,080
 wives, knowing different things, remember?

51
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,440
 But when Lillian and I, we've been in this church for almost 16 years, I wonder if many

52
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,560
 people know what we do for a living.

53
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,840
 And look around you.

54
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,820
 You may know the name of the people sitting next to you, but do you know what they do

55
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,640
 for a living?

56
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,000
 It seems like we know what our pastors do.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,760
 We know what Pastor John do, or Johnny and Michelle, what they do here.

58
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
 And we know each other.

59
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,960
 We may know, "Oh, this is worship team, Florence worship team, and we have ambassadors, we

60
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,680
 have sound person, we have deacons here."

61
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,880
 We all know people, they're serving roles, but that's all.

62
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,600
 And other than that, we carry little roles in God's kingdom.

63
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:53,600
 In a sense, we are like nobody in God's kingdom.

64
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:02,400
 As a nobody, coming back to this calling, how can we answer to this call for a new breed

65
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,120
 of disciples in God's kingdom?

66
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,920
 That call may sound so remote to you.

67
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,000
 That certainly sound remote to me.

68
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,600
 It seems like there are already so many obstacles for everyone, not just Christians in the marketplace.

69
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:31,280
 And that is the state I want all of us to enter into the passage Bonnie just read to

70
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,400
 us, the story of Zacchaeus.

71
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,440
 Zacchaeus is a unique character in the Bible stories.

72
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,560
 He was not only a tax collector, he was the chief tax collector.

73
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,240
 He was a wealthy person and he was a high ranking government officials.

74
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,600
 Normally, people with that profile, you would expect he will receive VIP sitting on the

75
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,040
 first row and then in a popular event.

76
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,600
 But you know from the story, that's not the case.

77
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,640
 Zacchaeus was despised by his people.

78
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:21,320
 He was an outcast to his people because of his profession.

79
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:28,160
 Back then, as a tax collector, people despised people in the tax collector because what they

80
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,800
 do, they collect heavy taxes for the Roman Emperor.

81
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,440
 And specifically for Zacchaeus, he was a Jew working for a foreign government.

82
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,680
 That put him a traitor to his people of Israel.

83
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,520
 And in verse 7, we knew that he was considered to be a sinner among the crowd.

84
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:58,520
 And then in verse 3, the scripture also described him as a short man.

85
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:09,640
 So from socially speaking and physically speaking, he was a nobody in the crowd.

86
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:16,520
 Let's take a pause here and reflect that back to ourselves.

87
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:25,600
 Do we see ourselves so far from Jesus when we try to live out our faith at work?

88
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,700
 For those of us working in the office, we may already be overwhelmed with all these

89
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,120
 challenges at work.

90
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,520
 And even for those of us homemakers, and I know that.

91
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,120
 I've been at home for the past four years, easily can take up the full days just doing

92
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,320
 house chores or meeting needs for our family.

93
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:55,200
 And we say, how do we possibly answer to this call to break down walls, build bridges, and

94
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,120
 seek God's will in the workplace?

95
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,000
 That's just impossible.

96
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,920
 And in the Bible passage, it's equally, it's also the same case for Zacchaeus.

97
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:15,600
 Zacchaeus being a nobody, short and also despised by people socially and physically.

98
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,320
 He has so many people in the crowd, he wants to see Jesus, the most popular guy, to come

99
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,240
 into his way.

100
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:31,360
 That's just impossible for Zacchaeus to meet Jesus personally.

101
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,520
 But then, when people ask, in a few chapters earlier, when people ask Jesus about salvation,

102
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:50,120
 Jesus replied, "What is impossible with man is possible with God."

103
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,640
 Let me first highlight a key word in the passage.

104
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:02,480
 Next slide, please.

105
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,480
 In this passage, in verse three, Luke used a word to describe Zacchaeus, the nobody.

106
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,800
 He said, in the NIV version, he said, he wanted to see who Jesus was.

107
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,400
 Actually, it's clearer in the ESV version.

108
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:22,120
 He said, Zacchaeus was seeking to see who Jesus was.

109
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:29,400
 The key word here in Greek is seek, sateo.

110
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:36,440
 With this, his nobody status, Zacchaeus faced so many obstacles in trying to reach Jesus,

111
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,820
 but he didn't give up.

112
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,840
 He climbed up a tree and tried to find a spot to see Jesus.

113
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,680
 And then, here the story comes to a sudden turn when Jesus showed up.

114
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:55,520
 When Jesus arrived to the spot where Zacchaeus climbed up a tree, he called Zacchaeus out

115
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,280
 of the whole crowd and said, "Wait a second here.

116
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:08,800
 Why would Jesus, out of everyone here, when he stopped at a place and called out to Zacchaeus

117
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,200
 by his name, why?"

118
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,480
 Can I have the next slide, please?

119
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:23,560
 It is Zacchaeus' heart to seek Jesus despite all the challenges he faced.

120
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:32,520
 In Luke 11, verse 9, Jesus said, "Ask and it will be given to you.

121
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,320
 Seek and you will find.

122
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,640
 Knock and the door will be opened to you."

123
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,000
 And that promise goes all the way back to the Old Testament.

124
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 In the Old Testament, can I have the next slide, please?

125
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,920
 In Moses said to the people of Israel, "But if from there you seek the Lord your God,

126
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:06,880
 you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul."

127
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,400
 Because Zacchaeus sought Jesus with all his heart and all his soul, despite all the challenges

128
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:18,760
 he needed to face, he found Jesus.

129
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:27,200
 But then we need to ask, in this passage, who is seeking whom here?

130
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:35,640
 While Luke starts this passage by saying Zacchaeus was seeking to see Jesus, Luke ends this passage

131
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,880
 by saying – can I have the next slide, please?

132
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,640
 For the Son of Man comes to seek and save the lost.

133
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,920
 Zacchaeus found Jesus because Jesus is seeking the lost.

134
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,960
 It is the central theme of Jesus' ministry on earth.

135
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:10,480
 The lost are those who do not know God in person, but also include those of us who struggle

136
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:19,800
 to live up our faith in the workplace, feeling lost.

137
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:26,960
 If you are currently feeling lost in your life, or you feel powerless at work, remember

138
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,720
 this.

139
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,600
 Seek Jesus at wherever you are.

140
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:42,520
 In family, in the office, at school, you will be found.

141
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:49,160
 So now let's take a look at what does it mean to be found by Jesus.

142
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,200
 Let's take a closer look at Jesus' responses to Zacchaeus.

143
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:04,160
 Jesus is seeking us to restore our true identity by knowing us personally.

144
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,440
 Can I have the next slide, please?

145
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:16,800
 In verse 5, Jesus first responded to Zacchaeus and called him by his name.

146
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,720
 Just now we learned that Zacchaeus was a nobody.

147
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,760
 If you are nobody in God's kingdom, you may think nothing matters, so I don't need to

148
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,800
 do anything because I'm just a small potato.

149
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:42,560
 Or in the other extreme, we may try very hard to think that we are somebody.

150
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,600
 At work, we try to work very hard to prove that we are better than others.

151
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,400
 And even in church, we try to take key position to think that we matter here.

152
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:01,520
 We try different ways to gain recognition from other people.

153
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:09,080
 But I remember last December when Pastor John shared with us the true meaning of Christmas,

154
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:22,200
 that Jesus being somebody as God's only son came to the world as nobody so that humans,

155
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:31,360
 we are nobody, can be somebody as God's children in his kingdom.

156
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,720
 Instead of addressing Zacchaeus by his work title, say, "Chief Tax Collector," or his

157
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:47,880
 financial status, "Hey, Richie," Jesus called him by his name, Zacchaeus.

158
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:56,640
 Jesus saw Zacchaeus as a human being made in God's image, more than just his role or

159
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,520
 his wealth.

160
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:06,880
 Last week, you all know that President Xi Jinping was here in Hong Kong.

161
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:15,920
 Imagine if he stopped right in front of you and call your name in person.

162
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,960
 How would that make you feel?

163
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:27,880
 But what about Jesus, the God's only son, King of Kings, creator of the world, knows

164
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:44,240
 your name, Samuel, Wallace, Kelly, Ivan, Joseph, he knows your name.

165
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,480
 When we know that, when we hold that belief that Jesus holds our name, we have a firm

166
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,760
 foundation with our identity in Christ.

167
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,320
 And that foundation could be challenged by our changing roles in the world.

168
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:08,720
 Personally, I've experienced several changes in my life in the past few years.

169
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,280
 Let me tell you a bit more about myself now.

170
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,960
 In the marketplace, I used to lead a team of portfolio managers to manage $5 billion

171
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,280
 US dollar of money for institution.

172
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,640
 And then my whole team in Asia was made redundant and I was out of draft for a few months.

173
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,560
 And then I went back to work for a startup firm to launch an investment strategy from

174
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,020
 scratch.

175
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,800
 And now I'm a full-time student for the last four years.

176
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:50,600
 And even in church, when I first came to KFC in 2004, I didn't do anything because we

177
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,440
 just started having children.

178
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,800
 It's very difficult to serve.

179
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,440
 We're nobody.

180
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,760
 And then over time, we did babysitting, we teach Sunday school, we did youth mentors,

181
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,340
 and then group leaders and something else.

182
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,120
 And now I'm just an intern.

183
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:22,720
 So in...so Paul, Apostle Paul in Philippians 4, he said that he has found the secret of

184
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,000
 being content in any and every situation.

185
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I believe that secret lies with our identity in Christ.

186
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,440
 Through the ups and downs, I hold on to my relationship with Jesus that he calls me personally

187
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,560
 to himself.

188
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:56,840
 And in that moment, my heart was filled with love from God.

189
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:08,400
 And I'm also experiencing the secret of being content in every and any situation because

190
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:20,040
 Jesus knows my name and Jesus knows your name.

191
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:26,120
 He restored our identity as people made in God's image.

192
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:32,460
 We are all somebody in God's kingdom.

193
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,380
 But Jesus came here not just to restore our identity.

194
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:44,080
 He also empowered us by entering into our life.

195
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:52,260
 After Jesus called Zacchaeus by name, he invited himself to stay at Zacchaeus' house.

196
00:19:52,260 --> 00:20:01,080
 By staying in his house, Jesus wants to be in people's life, at home, in the office,

197
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,440
 at school, in church, wherever we go.

198
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,480
 He doesn't just stay here in church or anywhere and expecting people to come here to worship

199
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,600
 him.

200
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:21,000
 Instead, he wants to go out and be with you and be into your life.

201
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,840
 When our life is filled with Jesus, he promised that we can live our life to its fullness.

202
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,880
 And it's so full that we can share these blessings to other people around us.

203
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,680
 And that's exactly what Zacchaeus experienced.

204
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,400
 When Jesus said he wants to enter into his house, his heart was so filled with joy that

205
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,080
 he willingly and happily shared half of his possession to the poor.

206
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:58,040
 He also promised to give back four times to whoever he cheated in the past.

207
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:08,680
 When Jesus is in our life, in his life, Zacchaeus is empowered to participate in God's kingdom

208
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,960
 work by sharing the gospel with other people.

209
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,040
 And this good news is not just telling people to believe in Jesus.

210
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:28,880
 You may have heard a famous quote called "Preach the gospel, use words if necessary."

211
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,240
 That is a quote attributed to St. Francis of Assisi.

212
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,440
 But that is actually a misquote.

213
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,280
 A, St. Francis never said that.

214
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:48,760
 And B, St. Francis actually meant for his preachers to encourage them to practice what

215
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,180
 they preach.

216
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:57,200
 So the key here is we should share the gospel with both words and deed.

217
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,880
 And Zacchaeus shared the good news with others by sharing his wealth.

218
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,680
 Financial resources is usually a good way for us to share God's love, but it doesn't

219
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,440
 stop there.

220
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:17,120
 Remember a few weeks ago when we learned about the church series, the disciples in times

221
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,000
 of act, when they were filled by the Holy Spirit, they spoke in tongue and shared the

222
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,280
 gospel.

223
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:30,800
 In present time, when we are filled by the Holy Spirit, when we receive Jesus into our

224
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,400
 life, in the current context, we can speak the business language.

225
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:43,400
 We can speak the family language of love to share the gospel with others.

226
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:51,640
 Like having lunch with our colleagues or families to have authentic, build our authentic relationship.

227
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,880
 Like listening to others to go through struggles together.

228
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,800
 Or like doing business with love and justice from God.

229
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,080
 In fact, that reminds me, this mask here is from a Christian friend of mine.

230
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:16,120
 He is managing a mask, but also hiring a bunch of deaf and people cannot speak, cannot hear,

231
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,680
 to work for him and create a mask for the society.

232
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:27,520
 That's another, this all these other way to share the gospel with people around us.

233
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:35,200
 And last week, Pastor John said he was, he is, he still is an Alpha-holic and that would

234
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,040
 make me an Alpha-holic junior.

235
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
 And next slide please.

236
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 I've been doing Alpha in the marketplace for many years and here's one example here in

237
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,200
 the slide.

238
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,520
 And if you can see, yes, this is right above us on the second floor.

239
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,880
 It was an Alpha that we ran with KFC together with Central Gospel Mission and Alpha Hong

240
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
 Kong.

241
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,200
 We had over a hundred people upstairs to have lunch together.

242
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,400
 And generally in Alpha, we share meals with people, a casual meal with our colleagues

243
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,280
 or families or friends.

244
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:21,560
 And then during the meals, we also engage them with a topic to discuss our faith and

245
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:28,600
 life and that's a very authentic way to share the gospel with others.

246
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,800
 And in KFC, we plan to run a marketplace Alpha later this year.

247
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:39,280
 So stay tuned on how you can participate.

248
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:45,160
 In addition to utilizing our presence in the marketplace, we can also use our work experience

249
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:50,920
 to build the kingdom of God in church and in the family.

250
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,920
 One example is one of our brothers, David Wong.

251
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,160
 A few weeks ago, he was in the marketplace sharing his experience about cryptocurrency

252
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:08,000
 investment, a very hot topic investment, and then connected it to God's kingdom value.

253
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,120
 And then also Pastor Johnny, later on in the summer, he will organize several career forums

254
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,720
 for our college students.

255
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:25,920
 All of us, we can share our work experience, Pastor John earlier, to our next generation.

256
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,960
 We can contribute our experience in God's kingdom.

257
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,760
 God is seeking all of us, not just the pastors, but all of us to join his movement in the

258
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,920
 workplace and in the church for his work.

259
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:52,560
 But then in doing all this, don't forget, Jesus is with us to do all this work.

260
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:59,640
 Without Jesus, we can easily burn out or feel powerless when we do God's kingdom work.

261
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,160
 And then head back to this nobody statuses, "Oh, it's so difficult.

262
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,480
 I'm so powerless."

263
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:17,040
 But like Zacchaeus, when Jesus enters into our life, we are blessed so abundantly that

264
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:28,280
 we can share God's blessings with others just with our presence in the workplace.

265
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:36,320
 Our presence, including our work experience or spiritual gift, can be offered as a pleasing

266
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:46,880
 sacrifice to God for building up the family of God in church and in the marketplace.

267
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:55,440
 If we feel powerless in doing God's kingdom work, remember this, Jesus wants to enter

268
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:04,160
 into your life to empower us to join God for his mission.

269
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,880
 Next slide, please.

270
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:13,400
 Jesus not only restores our identity and empower us, he doesn't stop there.

271
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,920
 He wants to connect us to a community of faith.

272
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:27,360
 In verse 9 and 10, we just read, Jesus proclaims that salvation has come to the house of Zacchaeus,

273
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,480
 and he is also a son of Abraham.

274
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,040
 Remember earlier, we said that Zacchaeus was despised by his people.

275
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,880
 He was an outcast.

276
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:52,880
 By calling Zacchaeus a son of Abraham, Jesus is connecting him back to a family, not justified

277
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,840
 by faith and not by works.

278
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,280
 I know many Christians in the marketplace, when we share and pray and share love, I hear

279
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:13,720
 one common struggle we face, that we feel lonely, we feel alone in the marketplace,

280
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:20,880
 and we find no support to live out our faith in the workplace.

281
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,400
 Yes, Christians are minority in the workplace.

282
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:34,480
 And yes, the culture in the world is very different from the biblical values.

283
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,360
 And this loneliness experienced by Christians in the marketplace is caused by a misbelief

284
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:54,120
 that salvation is only a personal matter, and Christian faith is just a private practice.

285
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:04,460
 But in this passage, we see from Jesus' proclamation, saying that salvation is also communal in

286
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:11,680
 nature, and we belong to a family of faith.

287
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:19,040
 And that family of faith goes beyond these four walls of the church.

288
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:26,040
 Outside Cornfolk Church, I've been actively connecting with Christians in the marketplace.

289
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,880
 When I first came back to Hong Kong from Boston in 2004, I didn't know anyone in the church

290
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,000
 or in the office, but then I didn't wait.

291
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,220
 I started a Bible study group in my office.

292
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:44,000
 And then God slowly connecting me to other Christians working in the same building at

293
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,280
 IFC, and we prayed together for our workplace.

294
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,320
 And then things start to happen.

295
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,320
 Next slide.

296
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,560
 Here's some photos in the next few slides.

297
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:02,840
 The photo on the left is a choir made up by Marketplace in Christians.

298
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,000
 For a few years, we were able to sing Christmas carols at the IFC malls.

299
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:16,720
 This is such a great opportunity to praise God and testify our faith in our own workplace

300
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
 community.

301
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,600
 It also connects us from different churches, different companies, serving together for

302
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,040
 the same mission of God.

303
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:32,440
 And then the picture to the right, it's also happened in the same place, IFC mall.

304
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
 It's a bunch of leaders.

305
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,160
 We call it IFC Alpha, that we've run several years.

306
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,440
 These are just the leaders.

307
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,720
 And over the years, we were able to, just one location, we were able to reach over hundreds

308
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,280
 or even thousands of people at the IFC through Alpha.

309
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:55,900
 And through, again, having meals with others and chatting about topic about faith.

310
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,900
 Next slide.

311
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:01,720
 And, but God doesn't stop me just at Central or in my place.

312
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,160
 He also connect me to this citywide network.

313
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,840
 The photos here on the top is a core team of leaders.

314
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:17,680
 We call it the Alpha Spark Network, that we try to promote Alpha everywhere in the marketplace.

315
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,720
 And then another photo to the right is a small group, what we call a halftime network.

316
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,000
 This is a group of people organized, actually led by also David Wong, to help professionals

317
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:41,560
 or anyone, or even pastors to seek the significance of our vocation in our second half, like what

318
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,360
 I'm doing.

319
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,000
 And then the photos at the bottom is another movement, citywide movement, called Ecclesiastical

320
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,560
 Movement, that we pray every month through Zoom, over the phone.

321
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:59,880
 But then here, every year on New Year's Day, we went up to the peak and pray for Hong Kong.

322
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,160
 It's so exciting.

323
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,240
 But then this network, it also takes in different forms.

324
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,360
 Next slide.

325
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,120
 The photos on the left is a group of Christian parents trying to pray for the high school

326
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,440
 attended by my kids, Lucas and Charis.

327
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,600
 And then in that network, we got to meet teachers and pastors working in the school.

328
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:31,160
 We also get to meet Young Life, the organization James serves, and it's that citywide network.

329
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,000
 It's so exciting to pray for school with others.

330
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:42,640
 And then the photos on the right is a network that I started two years ago, called Marketplace

331
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,480
 Network for Christ.

332
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:51,180
 It is a network that we meet every week, even over the past two years, during COVID time,

333
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:58,080
 we meet every, we gather every week over Zoom and lunchtime, and we seek God in the marketplace

334
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,720
 together.

335
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,680
 And here in this photo, I want to highlight one person here.

336
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:12,440
 If you have good eyes, you will see that at the bottom and the center, that's Pastor John.

337
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:23,800
 I have to say that Pastor John is truly a pastor who practices what he preaches.

338
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:32,320
 Before I worked here at KFCI as intern, I must say, I see Pastor John more in the marketplace

339
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,000
 than in the church office or here in this fellowship hall.

340
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:43,960
 This man was just everywhere that we meet everywhere, like the Ecclesiastical Network,

341
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,320
 the YMCA, at Alpha, at Movement Day, everything, many other things.

342
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,040
 And even in places you wouldn't expect a Westerner to be there, some Chinese speaking worship

343
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,840
 conference, I also meet Pastor John there.

344
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:11,360
 He just dedicated his time to walk with Christians in building up this citywide network.

345
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:21,040
 But what I want to say here is that all this group has one thing in common, that God is

346
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,240
 called, is gathering Christians all over the city to come together and share a journey

347
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:37,480
 in building a faithful community to seek God's will at wherever we are in our presence, in

348
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,080
 places of our presence.

349
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,560
 Every week I come to KFCI to worship with you all, that's certainly a highlight of my

350
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,080
 week.

351
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,520
 But it doesn't stop here.

352
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:58,520
 I'm equally excited every week to meet Christians in the marketplace Monday to Friday.

353
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:05,800
 And we together, we have a mission mindset to seek God's work, God's will in the marketplace

354
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,360
 everywhere in our city.

355
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,500
 That is just so exciting.

356
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:19,660
 And that community in the marketplace keeps me excited every Monday morning to look forward

357
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:26,520
 to joining God's adventure with God in the marketplace.

358
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,080
 And all these years I have witnessed one truth.

359
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,320
 You have to remember one thing tonight.

360
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:43,040
 God is actively at work in our city, in the workplace.

361
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:52,300
 And He is calling Christians, all of us, at home, at school, in the office, anywhere we

362
00:35:52,300 --> 00:36:02,700
 go to join Him for this kingdom work and building a faithful community.

363
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:07,260
 Christians are not alone in the marketplace.

364
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:17,220
 God is with us and He has already put special agents, that is you and me, in the marketplace.

365
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,140
 At home, in the office, at school, everywhere we are.

366
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:24,920
 We don't need to wait for the church to come out.

367
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:31,420
 We just need to seek God at wherever we are.

368
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:40,140
 The Holy Spirit will connect us to a community in the marketplace.

369
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,260
 Let's have a summary of what I just did in this sermon here.

370
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,580
 Next slide, please.

371
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:58,180
 We are all called to join God to live out our faith in the workplace.

372
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:06,420
 And in times when we feel lost or when there are so many obstacles in the workplace that

373
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:11,420
 make us feel like we're so far from Jesus.

374
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:20,940
 Like Zacchaeus, we can seek Jesus with our hearts at wherever we are and we will be found

375
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,780
 by Jesus.

376
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:36,980
 In Christ, when we feel that we are nobody, Jesus comes to restore our identity as children

377
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,440
 in God's kingdom.

378
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,240
 Jesus knows our name.

379
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,780
 He knows everything in us.

380
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:55,820
 Our work Monday to Friday or our service at church, everything matters in God's kingdom.

381
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:06,360
 In Christ, if you feel powerless, Jesus enters into your life to empower us.

382
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:15,600
 He fills our life with his love so that we can live it to its fullness and share it to

383
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:23,800
 others and participate in God's kingdom work with everything we need from God, our gift

384
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,180
 from God.

385
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:39,700
 And in Christ, if we feel alone, Jesus, God will connect us to a community that's where

386
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:46,600
 we can belong and have someone to walk with us together in our life.

387
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:57,300
 So tonight, for those of us, if you have not received Jesus into your life, I invite you

388
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:03,980
 to seek Jesus into your heart.

389
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:10,700
 God will restore your identity as children of God.

390
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:21,260
 He will fill your life to its fullness, and then he will lead you to a family to walk

391
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,900
 this life journey together.

392
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:34,700
 And for my fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, when you feel lonely, alone, powerless

393
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:44,220
 at work, I invite you to seek Jesus with your heart as well.

394
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:56,260
 Jesus, God will recognize your identity and your gift, your whole self in his kingdom.

395
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:03,040
 He will empower you and fills you with all you need to live out faith.

396
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,360
 And then you are not alone.

397
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:12,500
 He will connect you to his special agents, his Christians, his people in the workplace,

398
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:20,340
 in school, at work, everywhere we go to form this faithful community together and to answer

399
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,420
 again back to this call to live out our faith in the workplace.

400
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:35,420
