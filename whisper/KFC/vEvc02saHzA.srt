1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,360
 I love the response here.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,120
 Now just before we start, let's play a little game.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,720
 Okay, I just added it right now.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,720
 This is a photo of me and my family.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,240
 Can anybody guess which country this is in?

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,120
 Just by this photo, you can tell if you have been here.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,480
 I'm going to try to point out the specialty.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,760
 No, it's not China.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,720
 So look at this stack of things.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,720
 Oh, somebody said Canada.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,720
 All right.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,120
 Please get a gift, a cookie from Bonnie at the end of this.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
 Thank you.

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,920
 Now, if you've been to Canada, you know that there is a restaurant that has these huge

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,240
 lobsters and they're so big that they're like 20 pounds each.

17
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,280
 Okay, they're like gigantic.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,040
 So if you've ever been there, you would recognize it by.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,380
 All right, good job.

20
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,880
 So some of you might or may not know me.

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,360
 My name is Michelle, and I serve as one of the pastors here.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,440
 It's really my honor here today to share a message with you.

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,460
 And it's on my heart really to share about honoring our father and mother.

24
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,520
 This is a topic that is huge in my heart, and I would love to share with you.

25
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,760
 Now, many a times we would think about why is it that we need to honor our father and

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
 mother?

27
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
 Sometimes we think why?

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,840
 And at the same time, we're thinking, what does it mean to honor?

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,280
 I mean, yes, we kind of know what that word is.

30
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,920
 But at the same time, we don't really.

31
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,400
 What's the difference between honoring them?

32
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,800
 And then is it the same as obeying everything they say?

33
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,160
 But what does it mean in the Bible when they ask us to honor our mother and father?

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,400
 And at the same time, how do we do it in our everyday life?

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,880
 So then we're following God's heart.

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,800
 So today we're going to package all of that together.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,520
 And let us start by reading this verse together.

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,680
 Can you all see this?

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,400
 All right, let's read it together.

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,720
 One, two, three.

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,600
 Honor your father and your mother that your days may be long in the land that the Lord

42
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,160
 your God is giving you.

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,840
 Now this is from Exodus.

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,960
 It's part of the Ten Commandments.

45
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,520
 Now I don't know, but if you were to think, okay, how did God give the Ten Commandments?

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,880
 I mean, did he give it through an email or maybe a WhatsApp?

47
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,180
 So then we can just kind of sit on our couch and we can scroll.

48
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,560
 You know how it is when you add a new app, right?

49
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,840
 You have all these agreements and what you do, you just scroll to the bottom and you

50
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,200
 say, I agree, right?

51
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,280
 But no, God didn't do that.

52
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,200
 And neither did God give it to Moses so that he could tell everybody about the Ten Commandments.

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,560
 But you know what?

54
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:09,560
 God actually spoke to the entire nation in person so that they would know the Ten Commandments.

55
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,740
 And this is how important it is to our God.

56
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,480
 Now how did he do it?

57
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,040
 He actually had them consecrated themselves for the last three days before receiving that

58
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
 message.

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
 What does it mean?

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,800
 So they need to wash their clothes.

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,080
 They need to refrain from any sexual relationships.

62
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,400
 And then they have to wait for the Lord.

63
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,140
 And how did it happen?

64
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:40,600
 Three days later, when they were ready to receive the word, God began to show up.

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,520
 The very first thing that happened was there was thunder and there was lightning.

66
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,480
 So it was just like a few weeks ago.

67
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:52,920
 You remember there was thunder so strong that when it roared, your heart feel like the drum

68
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,920
 set was inside your heart.

69
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,600
 Is that huge?

70
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,800
 And what he did was he came as a thick cloud onto the mountain in Mount Sinai.

71
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:09,160
 And the whole mountain was burning in fire.

72
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,960
 And the entire mountain was shaking.

73
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,160
 It was trembling because what?

74
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,720
 God himself, God of the universe showed up.

75
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,200
 And this is how important the Ten Commandments is.

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,800
 And many times we think to ourselves, "But it's only for the Israelites.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
 It's for those people."

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,840
 But no, it's for everyone who believes in God.

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,560
 Because in the New Testament, Jesus said that I came not to abolish the laws, but what?

80
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,680
 To fulfill them.

81
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,140
 And as followers of Christ, we would do that too.

82
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:52,280
 And so not only is it that the Ten Commandments was really important, but at the same time,

83
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,040
 you know, there are only 10 things you can put on there, right?

84
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:05,320
 And guess when, out of these 10, where does honoring your father and mother stand?

85
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,120
 Anybody can shout out, maybe you can get a cookie too.

86
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,720
 Five, that's right.

87
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
 Look at that.

88
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
 It's fifth.

89
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,120
 Now, how often it is when we think about, have we sinned against God?

90
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,180
 Usually, I mean, I'm guilty of this.

91
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,440
 What I do is I start thinking, "All right, have I been worshiping other gods?

92
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
 Let me see.

93
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,800
 Have I been making an idol so I would worship?

94
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,360
 Did I murder anyone?

95
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,640
 Nope, I guess no, maybe not the past year.

96
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,840
 I mean, let's not go back all the way.

97
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,880
 And we think about, have we stole anybody's stuff?

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
 Nope, nope.

99
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,240
 So we're checking each one off.

100
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:48,440
 But how often really is it that we think about, have we sinned against God by not honoring

101
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
 our father and mother?

102
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,400
 I mean, I don't know about you, but I certainly haven't.

103
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,080
 I should start.

104
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,120
 And basically, what does that mean?

105
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,760
 That means that we have just, we like to pick and choose what are the important ones, but

106
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,760
 God has shown us what's important.

107
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,640
 And being in fifth place also has a very special thing that we can note.

108
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
 What is it?

109
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,640
 Is that the first four were actually about God himself.

110
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:26,680
 And this is the very first commandment that God gave about how we treat other people.

111
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,200
 And so he finds it to be the most important thing for us if we want it to treat other

112
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
 people.

113
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,040
 And that's why he put it in the fifth commandment.

114
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:42,280
 And so I just wanted to say that the first reason that we would need to honor our parents,

115
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,640
 because it's extremely, really very, very important to God.

116
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,400
 And if it's so important to God, we should really take it into our heart.

117
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:02,080
 And now as we continue to look at this 10 commandments, we realize that it's so important

118
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,400
 that God himself had to tell us and he didn't give it to someone else.

119
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
 Right?

120
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,000
 But at the same time, what we also see is that God has established this authority to

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,200
 us in our families.

122
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
 Now think about this.

123
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,020
 God has established different authorities, right?

124
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:28,960
 He has had before judges and kings, priests, prophets, and they were the ones that would

125
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,380
 be in charge.

126
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,520
 They would be the one in authority.

127
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,920
 And yet God put parents, father and mother as our authority.

128
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:47,480
 Now when we honor them, we're not only honoring the parent, we're actually honoring the person

129
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,960
 who has established this authority.

130
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
 And who is that?

131
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,800
 That's our God.

132
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,080
 And so when we honor our parents, we are honoring God himself.

133
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,720
 It's a way for us to honor God.

134
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,800
 Now at the same time, we can see that the third thing is that when we honor our father

135
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
 and mother, it is actually our act of worship.

136
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
 Now why would that be?

137
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,440
 I mean, we've already established the second point where it's honoring God, but remember,

138
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,840
 that's only the fifth commandment, honoring your father and mother, that's just the first

139
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,000
 part.

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,860
 What is the promise?

141
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,460
 That your days will be long in the land that the Lord, your God has given you.

142
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,580
 So there is a promise to it.

143
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,400
 And so when we honor our father and mother, we are actually putting our faith into the

144
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,900
 promise that God has given to us.

145
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,020
 Now this is not like using our father and mother so that we get goodies.

146
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,020
 It's not like that.

147
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,540
 I mean, technically we do get blessings from God, but what that really means is that you're

148
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:55,100
 telling God, God, I trust your word.

149
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,500
 I trust it so much that I'm going to do something in order to receive the blessing that you

150
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,700
 have promised.

151
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,080
 And that to God is an extremely honoring thing for him.

152
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:16,300
 So for us to honor our parents is a way that we tell God, we believe that the promise you

153
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:22,100
 have for us, the land, the long life, you're going to give that to us.

154
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,660
 Now every so often we might find someone who has honored their parents, but have not received

155
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,660
 that.

156
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,100
 And that's because there are other factors affecting it.

157
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,700
 That's just the same as when we go exercise, we believe that it's going to let us slim

158
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,060
 down and we're going to have a healthy body.

159
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,340
 But sometimes that doesn't happen because there are other factors affecting it, but

160
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,300
 it does not invalidate that promise.

161
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,540
 So that's why we can continue to believe in God and to know that we can hold onto his

162
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,360
 promise.

163
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,020
 So now that we have established these three points as the reasons why we need to and why

164
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:09,820
 we should, and we definitely have to, if we're Christians to honor God, is to honor our parents.

165
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,140
 Now really what does the word honor means?

166
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,180
 I mean, we have heard that word before.

167
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,380
 Now is there any English teacher in the room?

168
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,180
 Well, even if you are, I guess you don't want to put up your hand at this moment.

169
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,480
 Let's look into the word honor and let's see what the English dictionary says.

170
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:37,620
 So here it says that honor means to have great respect for someone or an award given to someone

171
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,980
 for something that they have done.

172
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,420
 We're like, oh, that's great.

173
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,060
 What's respect again?

174
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,860
 So now we look at what respect is in the English dictionary as well.

175
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,260
 So this is a strong feeling of approval of someone or something because of their good

176
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,820
 qualities and achievements.

177
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,980
 Now we put that two together.

178
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,980
 Do you see some similarities among the words?

179
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,340
 I mean, they should, I mean, they are going in the same direction.

180
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:12,220
 And what we see, which is very interesting, is that both of these words have a sense of

181
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,940
 an approval or award.

182
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,100
 So you're giving something.

183
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,300
 It's like a praise, which is good.

184
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:24,700
 But for what reason they said something that they have done or the good qualities or achievement

185
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,980
 that they have done.

186
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,380
 Now this is how the English dictionary tells us.

187
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,980
 Now just keep that in mind for now.

188
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,220
 And we're going to go to the original text.

189
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,420
 We're going to go to Hebrew to see what is it.

190
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,700
 The Hebrew language is the language that the 10 commandments was recorded in.

191
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,340
 So we're going to have a look and see how they understood this word.

192
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,060
 Now honor, kabad, really is to have weight.

193
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,020
 Now weight means importance.

194
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,420
 To have weight and respect.

195
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,380
 Respect in Hebrew means to revere or to fear.

196
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,540
 A high praise to another person because of what?

197
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,380
 That person's status.

198
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,780
 That person's status.

199
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:13,180
 Now also in the New Testament, Jesus also referred to the fifth commandment and he used

200
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,700
 the word honor in Greek, which is timal.

201
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,980
 And what's the definition?

202
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:28,940
 It is to assign value, to give proper recognition because of office, position or wealth.

203
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,100
 Now again, when we put those together, what is it that you see?

204
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,200
 You see in the Hebrew word, it really means to give value, to give importance.

205
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,340
 But what's the reason?

206
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,180
 It isn't for something that they have done.

207
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,700
 And it's not for something that they're, it's not about their character either, but it's

208
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,020
 for a status.

209
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,700
 It's for a position that they hold.

210
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,260
 And what kind of a position does our parents hold?

211
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,860
 Well, they're a father and they're a mother.

212
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,540
 They don't have to earn it to be our father and mother.

213
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,380
 And neither do they have to be perfect to be your father and mother.

214
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,940
 And I mean, we're not definitely not perfect.

215
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,260
 But in the English word, it has that sense where you get to be the person who judges

216
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,660
 and say, rather or not, you approve or not.

217
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,700
 But in the Hebrew and the Greek, you don't.

218
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:27,700
 And we aren't in the position and we shouldn't be to judge rather or not they are and whether

219
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,740
 or not we should honor them, right?

220
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:37,620
 So here from the Hebrew and from the Greek, we see what God really meant when he said,

221
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,900
 honor your father and mother.

222
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:46,340
 It means to give them importance because of their position.

223
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,580
 And so as we continue, we're going to see, all right, so now we get it.

224
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,180
 I get why we need to do it.

225
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,180
 I also now get the word, but really, how do we do it?

226
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,580
 And what does it look like in our everyday life?

227
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,980
 Because I don't really get what does it mean to give importance to someone?

228
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:10,500
 Now, so we'll first look at, I won't be reading this, but I'll be telling you what it is.

229
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,740
 This is a story of Ruth.

230
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,900
 Now Ruth is, Ruth and Naomi, some of you may have read it before.

231
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:24,380
 So Naomi is someone who had two sons and a husband.

232
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:33,640
 But sad tragedies happened and both her husband and the two sons have passed away.

233
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,940
 And now she has two daughters-in-law and she knew that she couldn't give any more sons

234
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,700
 to the two daughters-in-law.

235
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,220
 So she has asked them, why don't you guys go back to Moab where you came from?

236
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,940
 You might be able to find a husband there and give birth and have your own offspring.

237
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,500
 So one of them went off, but Ruth, the other one, would not.

238
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:01,080
 And she insisted, and this is what she said too, "Do not urge me to leave you or return.

239
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,040
 For where you go, I will go.

240
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,760
 Where you lodge, I will lodge.

241
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,120
 And your people shall be my people.

242
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,960
 Where you die, I will die.

243
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
 There will I be buried.

244
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:18,000
 May the Lord do to me and more also, if anything, but death parts me from you."

245
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,880
 Now she has this determination, but do you know what she's determined?

246
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:31,240
 She is determined to consider her mother-in-law first before herself.

247
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
 I'll say it again.

248
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,160
 She's determined to consider her mother-in-law first before herself.

249
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,160
 What does that mean?

250
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:46,560
 Actually, we can learn from the story that in order to put an importance to someone,

251
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,000
 it's really deciding that they have priority even above yours.

252
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,320
 Think about this.

253
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,680
 Back then, this is for Ruth.

254
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,280
 If she had no husband, if she had no sons, she would be nothing in that society.

255
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:08,040
 And so she said that, "I'm willing because I know if I'm not going with you, you as a

256
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,680
 widow, an old lady, would have nothing.

257
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,880
 And the only thing that I could do is that I would consider your benefits before mine."

258
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,560
 And what she did was she put her life, she put her offspring, she put her future and

259
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:33,160
 everything into that basket and said, "I would rather consider you first before me."

260
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,760
 And this is what honoring means, to put them before you.

261
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,400
 Now I want to put it in the 2020 context for you.

262
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:49,920
 I mean, what if you see a new iPhone that comes out and you're like, "Oh, it's got a

263
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
 three camera on the back.

264
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
 Oh, wait.

265
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
 Yes, on the back."

266
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,000
 You're like, "It's so good."

267
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And what do you want?

268
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 You want to get it, right?

269
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
 So you go and you purchase it.

270
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,760
 And what do you do?

271
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,400
 You give your old phone to your mom.

272
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,460
 We've all done that.

273
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,460
 Don't be guilty.

274
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,920
 And then your mom is actually very happy because why?

275
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,880
 She's saying that, "Oh yeah, don't give me the new one because I would waste it.

276
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,520
 I don't know all the functions and what does this button do again?

277
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,360
 How come it only has one button?"

278
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,920
 And so it seems "wasteful" on her, wouldn't it?

279
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:39,680
 In the same way, it was "wasteful" for Ruth to put her life aside for her mother-in-law.

280
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,400
 But imagine what if we saw, "Oh, there's a new iPhone that's coming out.

281
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,400
 Oh, it's so good.

282
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,320
 Can I get one for my mom?"

283
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,760
 No, but think about that.

284
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,560
 Honoring them, putting them before you.

285
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,600
 And what if you go shopping and as men, you see, "Oh, this is a really nice shirt."

286
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
 I don't know how men think.

287
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,000
 Sorry, I'm just thinking about how men think.

288
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,040
 "This is a really nice shirt.

289
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,960
 Wow, the style is very nice."

290
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,320
 And you go to the salesperson and you ask, "My dad wears an extra large.

291
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,080
 Do you have a size in that?"

292
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,200
 Putting them first in our everyday life.

293
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,040
 And at the same time, we continue to look at another record in the Bible, which is in

294
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,400
 Ephesians chapter 6, verse 1 to 3.

295
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,720
 Here Paul actually exhortates and he says, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord,

296
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,280
 for this is right."

297
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,880
 And he then quotes, "Honor your father and mother.

298
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:44,000
 This is the first commandment with a promise that it may go well with you and that you

299
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,840
 may live long in the land."

300
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
 Remember this, right?

301
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,480
 This is from the fifth commandment.

302
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,480
 Now notice here, he does ask us to obey our parents, doesn't he?

303
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,720
 Notice something that he tags on at the back.

304
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,560
 He says, "Obey your parents in the Lord."

305
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,560
 Now in the Lord is a very interesting phrase.

306
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,560
 What does that mean?

307
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,720
 So it has two meanings.

308
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,480
 The first meaning is that it means that you do unto them as if you're doing it to God.

309
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,800
 And the other meaning is that you do to them, you obey them in the principle and the teachings

310
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,240
 and in the characteristics of the Lord.

311
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,480
 Now again, what does that look like, right?

312
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,640
 Basically that means in our everyday life, I mean, it's easy if our parents just ask

313
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,360
 us to go get the groceries, I don't think we really need this, okay?

314
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
 Is it in the Lord?

315
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
 I don't know.

316
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,040
 Just get the grocery, okay?

317
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,360
 Now, so it's not really for those scenarios, but it is for other ones, okay?

318
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,560
 It is for the gray areas.

319
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,640
 Okay, what if your mom tells you or your dad tells you, "Go get a job, okay?

320
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,040
 Go get a job, son."

321
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,700
 And then what is it that you go through in your mind?

322
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,800
 If we obey, yes, I'm going to go get a job, but in the Lord, it means that I'm going to

323
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,840
 do it in a way that glorifies God.

324
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,080
 And how does that look like?

325
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,280
 Well, it means I'm going to start evaluating.

326
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:11,960
 Does this job allow me to spread gospel to my friends, the coworkers?

327
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,280
 Does it even allow me to have an alpha class there so that I can tell people about Jesus?

328
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:25,160
 And or is this job going to have temptations there where it drags me away from following

329
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,160
 God?

330
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,360
 And if it does, then I'll stay away from that.

331
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,080
 So what it really means is that obey them, yes, in the Lord.

332
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,480
 Well, if it's neutral, you do it in God's principle.

333
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,320
 Now, of course, we get to the hard part where it is that you actually have a conflicting

334
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:47,640
 situation where your mom and dad ask you to do something that is different than the Lord's

335
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,760
 teaching.

336
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,480
 They might ask you to a date a certain person that has a very different belief than you

337
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,240
 do and you believe that it might drag you away from worshiping God.

338
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,880
 And so what do you do?

339
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,840
 Well, in that case, obey, but in the Lord.

340
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,080
 Now, the Lord, if you're doing it to him, he would not ask you to do that.

341
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,000
 So in the Lord has its boundaries.

342
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,040
 So you would simply have to say, "No, I cannot because of my faith."

343
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:21,680
 Now just because of that, remember we said it's also in the qualities of Christ, the

344
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,100
 characteristics of Christ.

345
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
 So what does that mean?

346
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,480
 That means even when you say no, don't just stop there.

347
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,840
 Continue to do all the 99 things that were not against the Lord.

348
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,920
 And your parents will be very, very strange.

349
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,720
 I mean, your parents will find you to be very strange.

350
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
 They're not going to be strange.

351
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,640
 They'll find you to be strange.

352
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
 And why?

353
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,800
 Because they're like, "Wait a minute.

354
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,740
 I thought we just had this fight.

355
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,720
 Why are you still going to do all these things?"

356
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
 And you know what?

357
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,400
 That's when we become the good testimony for God.

358
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,880
 And for the parents that we didn't have, they're not believing yet.

359
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:09,020
 That's when they wonder, "Why is it that my son or my daughter is willing to still obey

360
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:14,680
 everything else I say, except the ones that are against their faith?"

361
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,760
 And so that allows us to have an opportunity to share our faith with them.

362
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,240
 We should use that.

363
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,840
 Oh, I stayed on this slide.

364
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,880
 So the second thing that is easy for us to grasp what honoring means is to obey them

365
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
 in the Lord.

366
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,360
 Now, the third thing that we want to look at together is a record from Matthew, chapter

367
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,360
 15.

368
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,160
 So here is an interesting record, because Jesus, who was asked by the Pharisees, the

369
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:52,600
 tribes, and also the religious leaders, "Why is it that your disciples don't follow the

370
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,400
 traditions, the teachings of our laws?"

371
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,960
 And the Lord really replied him, surprisingly, using the fifth commandment.

372
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:11,680
 And he says this, "For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother, and whoever reviles

373
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,240
 father or mother must surely die.'

374
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,920
 But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother what you would have gained from

375
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:26,080
 me is given to God, he need not honor his father.

376
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,280
 So for the sake of your tradition, you have made void the word of God, you hypocrites.'"

377
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,840
 Now let me just kind of dissect that a little bit.

378
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
 What did I just read?

379
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:42,680
 What that really meant was that there were people in the religious authorities who told

380
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,040
 the believers that, "You know, whatever you've put aside to honor your father, to take care

381
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,080
 of them, you were going to buy something or you were going to pay for this for them, don't

382
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,320
 worry about it.

383
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,400
 Use that money, give it to God, and you would have done your duty of honoring."

384
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,760
 And that, Jesus says, is a hypocrite.

385
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,480
 Now why would that, what does that have to do with us?

386
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,040
 Because we need to care for our parents.

387
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,640
 But if we think that, "Well, people tell me that as a Christian, what I need to do is

388
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,800
 I need to go to church, join a small group, I'll read the Bible, I'll pray, and I'll tithe,

389
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:28,960
 which means I'll give part of my money to God, and I think I've done all those things."

390
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:39,080
 And yet, if we go home and we don't honor our parents, Jesus calls us hypocrites, calls

391
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:45,440
 us hypocrites, because we can't say that we've already done everything for God, but then

392
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,600
 not really understanding His commands and what's on His heart.

393
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,760
 And so for us really, is to take care of our parents.

394
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
 Remember that sum of money?

395
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,040
 Well, that sum of money wasn't just going to sit there, the sum of money were meant

396
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,880
 to take care of them, to provide for them, to give to them.

397
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:14,040
 And so here today, we actually have three different ways for us to honor our father

398
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:20,840
 and mother in a very contextual way, which is to consider them before ourselves, which

399
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:26,480
 is to obey them in the Lord, and also to care for them, especially when they're in old age.

400
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,680
 Now right now, I want to share a little bit of my story with you, because I think it ties

401
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,960
 in a lot with this topic today.

402
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,800
 Now I have a lot of memories with me and my mom, so I'm going to share a little bit with

403
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,120
 you.

404
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,240
 So one of which is, I remember a number of years ago when I was working in an iBank,

405
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,640
 and I would have these clients meeting all the time, and I would be with my boss, and

406
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,240
 so we'll all be in this room.

407
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,960
 Of course, your parents pick the best time to call you, right?

408
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,720
 So you see your phone ringing and ringing, and you're like, "Oh, wow, I really can't

409
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
 take this."

410
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,840
 So you just kind of mute it, or you swipe it.

411
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,560
 And so they call for a few times, right?

412
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,120
 You're just going to put it aside.

413
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,160
 And after a while, I really thought to myself, "You know, I think my mom, she's really important

414
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,560
 to me.

415
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,800
 She's way more important to me than my boss."

416
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
 Hello, boss.

417
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:28,920
 And then my job, then the clients that I need to see, then the people.

418
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,760
 Because I can lose all those things, and I would literally be okay, but it would not

419
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,120
 be okay if I lost my mother.

420
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,840
 So from that moment on, I was telling myself, "All right, let's switch around."

421
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,400
 So now when the phone calls, I actually excuse myself, or I just pick it up, and I see what

422
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,880
 it is that's on her mind.

423
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,760
 Or if I really can't, I immediately WhatsApp her and say, "Oh, I really am in a meeting.

424
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,840
 What can I do for you?"

425
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,720
 And I think those little things, it's just a way because I wanted to honor her.

426
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,520
 I really want her to not have to struggle.

427
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,520
 Maybe sometimes she's at the fish market, and all her question is, "Do you want fish

428
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,520
 tonight?"

429
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
 And that was it.

430
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,440
 But I don't want her to be hanging for a few hours.

431
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:19,320
 And to really make her important in my life and every day kind of looks like this.

432
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,440
 And every day when I go home, I would go into her...

433
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:27,000
 Well, if she's already in her room, I'll go into her room, or we'll just be at the dinner

434
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,720
 table, and I would share with her the whole day, what happened.

435
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
 And you know what?

436
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,440
 I just want to let you know, she probably knows more about you guys than you guys know,

437
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,240
 because I've told her everything about everybody.

438
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,280
 But because I think, what is it that she wants?

439
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,680
 What is it that our parents want?

440
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,560
 Isn't it to connect with their children?

441
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,080
 Isn't it to be a part of their lives?

442
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,280
 But then maybe sometimes you just go home, shut our door, and if they ask, "Oh, how was

443
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
 your day?"

444
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,920
 Or, "How did that date go?"

445
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,040
 You're kind of, "Don't ask me."

446
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:09,200
 But maybe if we prioritize them, and if we engage them in our lives, then it will open

447
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,200
 a door for us to connect together.

448
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,760
 And the third one is a little bit hard to say, because...

449
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,040
 So one time, I find my mom to be annoying.

450
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,600
 Oops, hi, Mommy.

451
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,720
 And what happened was...

452
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:33,200
 So I went home, and I was like, "Oh, well, thank God I can actually get off on time that

453
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
 one day."

454
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,600
 And so I was sitting on my couch, just turning on the TV, that time in me time, okay?

455
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,040
 Nobody bugs me now.

456
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:47,840
 And so this small, still voice, which is not God, comes out from the end of the hall, okay?

457
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
 And it's like, "Hey."

458
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
 Oh, hey.

459
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,600
 And then she tells me, "Oh, I have this bump, this bump."

460
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,720
 And I'm like, "Okay, I know you have had it for like two months."

461
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,520
 I thought to myself, "And I asked you to go to the doctor, which you didn't."

462
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,640
 And so she's like, "It's seeping blood."

463
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,040
 I'm like, "Okay, but I'm watching TV."

464
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:13,400
 And so she goes around the house trying to find a band-aid, and of course, they never

465
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,720
 find it.

466
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,840
 And the band-aid don't know where they went at that time.

467
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,680
 All the other times, the band-aid just kind of lies on the table.

468
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,240
 But just the moment when you need it, you can't find it.

469
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,520
 So in my head, I was thinking, "Mom, honestly," in my head, I was like, "I just wanna sit

470
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,240
 there, do nothing.

471
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,920
 Can you take care of yourself?"

472
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,640
 I thought for a moment, "There's really nothing much I can do."

473
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,600
 But then another thought came to mind, and I was like, "I guess she is in a lot of pain.

474
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,320
 It has been there for two months.

475
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,560
 It must have bothered her.

476
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:58,640
 And of all the people, she wanted me to care for her at that time, that particular time."

477
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,280
 So what did I do?

478
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,760
 I got up, turned off the TV, went to her room to make sure I know exactly, is it a two by

479
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,980
 two or is this four by two?

480
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,760
 Make sure I buy the band-aid that would be big enough to cover the bump.

481
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,960
 So I went down to Man Lane, which is just about to close.

482
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:23,400
 I got the band-aid, went back, cut it up, stuck it on her skin.

483
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,240
 Did she get better?

484
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
 What do you think?

485
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,880
 No, of course not, I'm not a doctor.

486
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,320
 But in her heart, she felt important.

487
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:45,120
 She felt that she was important in my heart, and she felt that I cared for her above my

488
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,280
 own needs first.

489
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:55,560
 And that moment, I think she really cherished the time where I cared for her.

490
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,880
 And I think that was priceless.

491
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,520
 And so why am I sharing these things with you is because I feel like many a times we

492
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,280
 think about what it means to honor God, and we think that it's the big stuff.

493
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,480
 It's the big decisions, but really it's not.

494
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,280
 It's the small ones.

495
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,520
 It's the everyday life little stuff.

496
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,080
 And yet those little stuff tells us, "Is she important?"

497
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,360
 Are you willing to consider them first, or yourself first?

498
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,240
 It's a way to honor them, right?

499
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,840
 Are you willing to take care of them?

500
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,480
 Are you willing to obey even though you really don't want to?

501
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,160
 I mean, most of this stuff isn't against the Lord.

502
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,440
 There's like one in like a hundred.

503
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,520
 And yet, are we willing to go that extra mile because they're important to us?

504
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:59,360
 And also because God said that it is important to Him that we honor our father and mother.

505
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,400
 And by doing these little things, we are already pleasing the God that we believe in.

506
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,440
 And we don't want to be hypocrites.

507
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,920
 We don't.

508
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:14,160
 Jesus said, "If we'd done everything else, but we just go home and pretend that we've

509
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,920
 already done what God has asked, then we would have missed the mark."

510
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,960
 So I wanted to show you a photo of my mom because she probably has her back.

511
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,800
 Can't press.

512
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,040
 Can someone help me at the back?

513
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,040
 I want to press the one with my mom's photo.

514
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,280
 Oh, there we go.

515
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,560
 This is from Mother's Day.

516
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,160
 Now you can see what she looks like because she knows so much about you guys.

517
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,320
 It's only fair that you know a little bit about her.

518
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,360
 And yeah, and you might have thought, "Oh, I've never even spoken of my dad, my father,

519
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,400
 because tomorrow is technically...

520
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,160
 Not technically, it is.

521
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,640
 It is Father's Day."

522
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,320
 Well, that's because my father passed away for more than 20 years ago.

523
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:13,880
 And for me to honor him, even though he's not here, is I don't really do do things,

524
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
 but he's in my heart.

525
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,560
 He's important in my heart.

526
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,680
 But tomorrow we are going to do something.

527
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:25,720
 I'm going to go to the flower market and like always on those special days, I'm going to

528
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:33,880
 pick out the best looking flower and I'm going to not buy the $20, you know, the small plants.

529
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,480
 I'm going to buy them a big bouquet.

530
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,640
 Not because I don't suppose, I don't know if he sees it.

531
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:46,240
 This is another theological question that we'll have to talk about another time.

532
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,920
 But because I wanted to honor him.

533
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,320
 He is still important in my heart.

534
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,680
 And when someone is, it doesn't matter where they are or what they've done or how long

535
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,640
 it has been.

536
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,040
 You still treasure it and you still want to honor them.

537
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,360
 So tomorrow, oh, it's showing, okay, so this is my dad and me.

538
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,160
 It's pretty cute back then, eh?

539
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,400
 Forcing you guys all to agree with me.

540
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:17,920
 But I just wanted to say that honoring our father and mother is so important in God's

541
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
 heart.

542
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:24,080
 And earlier today, actually while we were praying, I was crying.

543
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,880
 I was crying not because I have to preach and I'm not sure how I'm going to do.

544
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:37,640
 I was crying because I just think, God, you wanted it so badly for us to honor our father

545
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,920
 and mother.

546
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,320
 And I'm so afraid that I don't do the just of it.

547
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,160
 I'm afraid that I'm not doing a good job, that you're not understanding how much God

548
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,720
 wants it.

549
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:59,000
 And so I just pray that it's in our heart that what God wants is actually the blessings

550
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,120
 that he wants to give to us.

551
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:09,680
 When we honor our father and mother, that promise doesn't say, "Then God is happy."

552
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,360
 It doesn't even say, "Then your parents are happy."

553
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:19,000
 It says that so that you would live long in the land that the Lord, your God has given

554
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,320
 you.

555
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,880
 It's a way for God to want to bless us.

556
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,280
 It's not a constraint.

557
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,280
 It is a blessing.

558
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,600
 So today I hope that God has spoken to you each individually what that honoring means.

559
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:42,000
 Maybe it means going out with them to dim sum for some of you.

560
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,520
 Maybe it means that you'll go with them to the doctor's appointment.

561
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:52,400
 Maybe it means that you'll be like me where you're now going to reply every single call

562
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,400
 that she has at the most inappropriate time.

563
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,400
 Whatever that may look like, maybe it's buying the band-aid at a very odd hour.

564
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,160
 I don't know what that looks like for you, but you know what?

565
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,600
 Only you could care for your parents the way that they wanted to.

566
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,160
 I can't care for your parents and neither can you care for mine, but God has placed

567
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,760
 them in our lives so that we could do that.

568
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,000
 And that's such an honor for us.

569
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:31,240
 So while we close now, let us pray together really for God to continue to speak to us.

570
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:38,560
 Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you so much that you've given us parents, father and mother,

571
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:47,120
 people that had brought us into this life and they were the first relationships that

572
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:54,680
 we've ever had, the first encounter of what you and your love look like.

573
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:02,520
 And Father, today I'm sure that you're speaking to all of us in a very special way.

574
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:10,760
 How can we honor our parents starting this Father's Day and for many days to come?

575
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:18,800
 And Father, we just pray that we will follow your commandments because it is important

576
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,600
 to you.

577
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:26,040
 And if it's important to you, Father, then it's important to us.

578
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:34,800
 And we pray that we will follow your ways, not only to honor them, but as a way to honor

579
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,240
 you because you're worthy of our praises and honor.

580
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,840
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

581
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:52,840
