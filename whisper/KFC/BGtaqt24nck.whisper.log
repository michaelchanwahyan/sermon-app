[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:26.460]   - God, what next?
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:56.120]   - So God, what next?
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.260]   Making decisions.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.280]   Life is full of choices.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.080]   Life is simply full of choices.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.280]   What kind of decision maker are you?
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:25.640]   Simple decision maker.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.560]   I like to make decisions fast.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:52.240]   What kind of decision maker are you?
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:38.200]   How do we decide?
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   How do we decide on these life decisions, big and small?
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.640]   To make the right decisions,
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.280]   we have to ask the right questions.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:13.880]   So the first questions I think are important to ask
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.520]   is this, what do I want?
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.720]   How will I get there?
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.600]   What do I want?
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.680]   What do you want?
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.200]   How will I get there?
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.280]   What do you want and how will you get there?
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   What do you want?
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.360]   What do others say?
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:06:14.400]   How will it play out?
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:32.840]   What is your destination?
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   Where do you want to go?
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.040]   And how will you get there?
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.080]   How will it play out?
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.560]   These are important questions.
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   And the final questions are this.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.240]   Does it really matter?
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.040]   What does God want?
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:12.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.920]   Does it really matter?
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:04.080]   Does it really matter?
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:17.320]   It's the questions that we really need to ask.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.480]   Does it really matter?
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.760]   We need to seek wise counsel.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.160]   Seek wise counsel.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:12.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.360]   Seek wise counsel.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:13.760]   Where there is no guidance, a people falls.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.440]   But in an abundance of counselors, there is safety.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.280]   Without counsel, plans fail,
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.680]   but with many advisors, they succeed.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:49.880]   Seek wise counsel.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.400]   Who do you usually consult on decisions?
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:05.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.520]   Who do you usually consult when making decisions?
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.400]   Seek wise counsel.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.480]   The second is seek God's counsel.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.240]   Seek God's counsel.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.280]   He knows what is best for us.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.880]   What purpose we were created for.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:12.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:26.880]   James, if any of you lacks wisdom,
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.320]   James chapter one, verse five,
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.880]   if any of you lacks wisdom,
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.360]   let him ask God who gives generously to all
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.160]   without reproach and it will be given to him.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:50.160]   Psalm 32, and I will instruct you
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.640]   and teach you in the way you should go.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.360]   I will counsel you with my eye upon you.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.920]   All the ways of man are clean in his own sight,
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.640]   but the Lord weighs the motives.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:22.520]   How do you hear God's voice?
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:45.520]   Speak into your life.
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:14:04.240]   How do you hear God's voice?
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:26.160]   Seek wise counsel and seek God's counsel.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.360]   Do not worry.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:40.160]   Do not worry saying what shall we eat
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.640]   or what shall we drink or what shall we wear
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.320]   or what school shall we go to
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.400]   or what city should we live in.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.240]   But the pagans run after all these things
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.400]   and your heavenly father knows that you need them.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.080]   But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.720]   and all these things will be given to you as well.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.400]   Him first.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:11.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:21.200]   It will simplify.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.320]   Do not worry.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.760]   Proverbs three says this.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.680]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.520]   and don't lean on your own understanding.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.960]   In all your ways acknowledge him
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.760]   and he will make straight your paths.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:11.160]   The Philippians.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.400]   Do not be anxious about anything
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.360]   but in everything by prayer and supplication
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.200]   with thanksgiving let your requests be known to God.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.880]   Just pray.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.640]   Share with me your thoughts.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:48.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:50.920]   Love God and love people.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.080]   Decisions.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.680]   Love God and love your neighbors
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.760]   and everything else will be fine.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:48.320]   Proverbs chapter three.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.280]   In all your ways acknowledge him.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:18:14.440]   Love God and love your neighbors
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.600]   and whatever you do, whatever you do,
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:20.280]   whatever decision you make,
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:24.240]   do all to the glory of God.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.600]   Whatever you do, whether you eat or drink,
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.280]   whatever you do, do it for God.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.960]   That is the most important thing.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.160]   Will you live your life for God?
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.000]   The heart of man plans his way,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.840]   but the Lord establishes his steps.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.280]   The heart of man plans his way,
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.960]   but the Lord establishes his steps.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:23.560]   The heart of man plans his way,
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.320]   but the Lord establishes his steps.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:30.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:37.160]   It will only happen if God allows it to happen.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.120]   So we trust, so we don't worry.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.000]   So we love him with all our hearts.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.040]   What is your next decision?
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:01.120]   Think about this.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:03.200]   Whichever decision you make,
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.160]   does it help you love God and love people more?
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.840]   If it does, then go for it.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.240]   Seek Him first.
