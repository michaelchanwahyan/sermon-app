[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   Yeah, I'm really excited to be here tonight.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.320]   So you've been warned.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.920]   I know God has put a message in my heart and whether or not you're ready, it's going to
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:17.920]   come at you.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.360]   But first, some of you are meeting me for the first time, so I just want to spend a
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.160]   few minutes to tell you about myself and our ministry.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.640]   So I am an only child who was born and raised in Hong Kong.
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.120]   I grew up in a very controlled and comfortable environment and the world centered around
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.920]   me and I loved it.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.220]   And so when I was in medical school and God asked me to serve in Africa, I objected and
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.280]   detailed in my journal seven great reasons why I should never be a missionary.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.020]   I like efficiency and convenience.
[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.460]   I do not like waiting or adventures.
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.860]   I love sashimi and air conditioning.
[00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.000]   I do not like camping or creepy crawlies.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.920]   So one day I argued with God again about how ridiculous it was to send unsuitable me to
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.380]   Africa.
[00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.260]   And then I realized that I either really believe God to be who he says he is or I don't actually.
[00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.540]   And if I really do believe him to be God, that it would only make sense for me to trust
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.220]   and obey and go to Africa even though I just did not think I had the patience or the strength
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.220]   or the courage to survive in Africa.
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.420]   So I wrote in my journal next to my seven reasons why I should never be a missionary
[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.540]   three words, "Lose your life," and said yes to a calling to Africa.
[00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.420]   And the very next day I met my gorgeous husband Henri who I got to marry four years later
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.300]   and together we founded the charity New Side Eye Care.
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.300]   So our calling comes from Luke 10 9 that says, "Heal the sick and tell them the kingdom of
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.620]   God is near you."
[00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.760]   Ninety percent of vision loss in this world is preventable or treatable.
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.200]   And so we are passionate about helping people see both physically and spiritually.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.600]   So our first mission was in Gabon, Africa where we led a non-profit eye surgical center
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.980]   until it reached self-sufficiency.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.200]   And then in 2012 we then with our children then age six, three, and one moved to the
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.400]   Republic of Congo, founded the charity New Side and established our first eye center
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.640]   in a little place in the middle of a rainforest called Mfondo.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.360]   And then in 2019 God moved us to Wesso where we live today and have started a second eye
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.120]   surgical center with a training center and we're in the process of building an eye hospital
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.720]   due to be completed this year.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.320]   So we've just celebrated 10 years of New Side so I just wanted to show you a little bit
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:16.480]   of the history of our charity which someone told me history actually is the word "his
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.480]   story."
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.560]   This is really all about God's story.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.240]   I went too fast.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   It didn't play.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   Let's see.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   There we go.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:52.520]   It's really, really, really simple.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   Really simple.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.120]   You know you see a patient today, if you've got a chance to operate him you can operate
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.400]   him and tomorrow morning you'll be able to see.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.400]   Very, very simple.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   That's amazing.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.640]   When someone can see again, the whole life is transformed.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.680]   Their lives are transformed and their family's lives are transformed, sometimes even the
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.680]   community.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.920]   It's something really tangible.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.440]   So for us, yes, it is probably a bit crazy to go but it's crazier to know that we can
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.080]   do something about it and not do it.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:33.320]   So it was in 2012 when we moved from the UK to the Republic of Congo and we started the
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.040]   country's first eye surgical centre and we started by building an extension.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.880]   You can keep the music up a little bit.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.960]   And then there in 2013 we opened our first eye centre and 2019 like I said we moved to
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:54.560]   Weso.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.240]   And God just kept growing the ministry and we added, we moved to a bigger building and
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.440]   then we added a new building for surgery and then later on we added another building for
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.840]   the training centre.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.640]   And in 2022 we began construction of an eye hospital in six hectares of land.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.760]   There is a ground breaking and we're really excited that the eye block will be completed
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.960]   by this year.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.480]   So obviously our main bulk of our ministry is about medical services and to date we've
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.440]   seen over, we've performed over 20,000 consultations and helping people who would otherwise suffer
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.920]   from blindness and visual disability.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:49.640]   We're honoured to be the country's first and only manufacturer of prescribed glasses.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:57.240]   And we're really honoured too that up until now we've received 100% positive patient feedback.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.720]   Community outreach is really important to us and it's in our heart to really go to the
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:10.680]   places that are hard to reach otherwise.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.600]   And as a result of COVID God actually opened a lot of opportunities for us so that we've
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.120]   actually served every household in the town of Weso.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.480]   And then 2021 we began our partnership working with over 30 local schools and we've also
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.080]   started producing the country's first and only children's magazine which today has over
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.320]   20,000 readership.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.120]   We've run various courses be it introduction to healthcare or nurses because obviously
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.640]   if we do not empower the local community the project will not be sustainable.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.320]   We're really proud of our students who have already completed their theory training and
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:07:00.640]   they're in the process of doing their practical training.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.080]   And God's just miraculously opened up many opportunities to work with the local government
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:10.880]   as well as companies and charities and you might start seeing people that are schools
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:29.840]   and churches and organisations and professionals who've been a part of this.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:36.120]   Part of our ministry has opened up opportunities to empower children to make a difference.
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.880]   We have a project called Project Two Frontiers which is about helping children see the needs
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.760]   of the world and understand that they too can make a difference.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:51.440]   We thank God for all these volunteers and short term missionaries who have come to join
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:58.240]   us in our work and they're supporting us on the field or from home in Hong Kong or elsewhere
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.360]   in the world.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:09.120]   And we really took the time to put these photos in because we wanted Guangfuk Church to really
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.120]   see for yourself.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.920]   It's not just about a missionary family somewhere in the middle of a rainforest doing their
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:20.060]   thing but like the Bible said how can we go unless we're sent and we're only possible
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.840]   there because of people like an architect who is a volunteer from Guangfuk or not just
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.920]   medical but also accountants, lawyers and it doesn't matter wherever you are God can
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:42.800]   use you to serve him in the mission field.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.340]   So here we are, here's God's story that is continuously written and we really just want
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.560]   to take this opportunity to really thank Guangfuk Church for all the support.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.640]   We really couldn't have done it without you.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:04.920]   So now if you'd like to find out more about New Side please do find us on social media
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.520]   or talk to us afterwards.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:12.720]   We would love to invite you to find out more about what God is doing in Africa.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.760]   But now here is the message I got really excited about.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.600]   So ready or not it's coming.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.040]   So we're going to start with a little home video.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.840]   I don't know, our kids love watching themselves over and over again.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:30.720]   So here's one of our little girl 10 years ago.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.720]   I think you have to press play maybe.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:10:00.480]   Okay so if you're taking notes the title of the message today is "Who me?
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.920]   Yes you."
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.560]   So let me take you to the year 2019.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.240]   We were at the time in the UK fundraising and preparing to move into Westall to pioneer
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.080]   our second eye surgical centre.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.840]   Now setting up the first eye centre and raising a young family in the middle of a rainforest
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.480]   the first time round was not easy.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.920]   That first year I cried every night.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:33.200]   Mostly because I was so worried about my disastrous attempt to homeschool the three
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   kids.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.440]   But I also obviously also missed my family, my friends.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.800]   I missed having reliable electricity, water, internet, car fuel and of course my beloved
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.520]   sashimi.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.920]   I missed you know just being able to go to the supermarket or go to concerts.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.460]   Basically the life I knew.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.560]   When things broke down there was just no easy way to have it replaced.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.640]   I also really struggled with the local way of doing things not to mention the threat
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:09.040]   of riots, armed rebels or dangerous so-called roles, snake scorpions in our yard.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:16.240]   So to see you know the blind see again it's always amazing.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:24.800]   But to me even to the blind it's really obvious that I'm not suitable for this mission life.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:32.200]   So here we were preparing to move to this new town to take on our biggest challenge
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:38.580]   yet a multi-million dollar construction project in six hectares of land and my anxiety level
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.200]   started to go up.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.000]   While we were being we were invited by the local authorities we didn't actually know
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.640]   anyone there and we tried to find a place for our family and our team and the three
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.720]   requirements were electricity, water and a toilet inside the house.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.240]   It took months and we couldn't find anything.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.360]   So you know we couldn't even manage to find a place to live.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.360]   How are we gonna do this big hospital project?
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.020]   Do we really have what it takes?
[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:11.880]   So one day as I was packing and like mentally preparing myself for how hard it was going
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:18.480]   to be out of the blue God said to me, "Hey Joyce, you think I can change the hearts of
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.480]   murderers?"
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.480]   "Yes, God."
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:26.780]   "You think how about like drug addicts and you know alcoholics, can I change them?"
[00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.440]   "Yes, God."
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.520]   So Joyce, how come you believe that I God can change those people and yet you cannot
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.400]   believe that I can change you?
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.720]   Why do you always think that you're gonna struggle in a developing country?
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.520]   Why do you not think that I can make you strong, brave and patient like your husband?
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.200]   Why do you not think that I can find a way so that even when it's really hot and sweaty
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:00.760]   and there's no electricity and water, you can actually be comfortable?
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.200]   This is a new season Joyce, God said.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.520]   This time you're not just gonna go out there and give new sight physically, spiritually
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.120]   to other people, but you yourself are going to have new sight.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:19.500]   You're going to stop seeing yourself the way you've always seen yourself or how other people
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.800]   see you.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.640]   But you're gonna learn to have new sight to see you the way that I, your God, sees you.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:32.040]   I'm gonna bring forth the person I've actually created you to be.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.240]   So I said, "Okay God, that sounds good.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:40.000]   But here's my little problem.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.440]   I find it a whole lot easier to believe the things you say about you than the things you
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:48.880]   say about me.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.360]   I trust you God, but me, I don't trust so much.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:58.780]   You see, you are really patient, but I really hate waiting.
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:03.940]   And you are strong and brave, but I'm not a risk taker.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.320]   You do great things God, but me do great things?
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.960]   Like that just sounds a little arrogant.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.660]   And you know, you tell me that I'm more than a conqueror, but like have you seen me succumbing
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.520]   to like stage fright, you know, vomiting sessions?
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:22.440]   Have you seen my self-pity parties and my meltdowns when things don't go my way?
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.660]   I know you are God, but have you perhaps confused me with someone else?
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.880]   Like my Superman husband perhaps?
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:36.100]   Why would you call me something that I obviously am not?"
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.020]   There was a man in the Bible who I think may have asked God the same question.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.520]   And his name was what we just read.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.520]   What's his name?
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.520]   Gideon.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.640]   And thank you Sebastian for reading Judges chapter six for us.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.600]   So the Israelites were having a national crisis.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   Every year after they had done all the hard work and they were ready to harvest, what
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.660]   would happen?
[00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:02.600]   These Midianites was charging, ransack, and steal everything, so much so that they were
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.040]   starving.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.800]   These bullies were like locusts and they were too numerous to count.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:14.000]   Now these Midianites and Israelites can both trace their lineage to Abraham, which makes
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.240]   them distant cousins.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:23.920]   So anyone ever had pests or problems even from within your family who just seem to keep
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.560]   coming back to drain and overwhelm you again and again?
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.760]   For the Israelites, this complete devastation and injustice, you know, having been going
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.600]   on for seven years, just when they start to recover from the last crisis, it's like, "Oh,
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   here we go again.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   Not them again."
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.920]   But then they come to expect it.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.160]   It's just the way it is.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.360]   You see though, it wasn't just food that they lost.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:53.160]   They also lost their peace and security, their confidence, and maybe even trust, because
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.180]   even their family was not good to them.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.080]   They had lost their way of life and it's easy to see that they might even feel that they've
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.160]   been abandoned by God.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.040]   You see, the enemy doesn't just steal the things that we can see like food.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.520]   He comes and steals the things we can't see as well.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.880]   So if, for example, you've lost your job, then the enemy comes and takes your confidence
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   as well.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:21.400]   Or you lose your health and the enemy just comes and steals your hope.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:27.240]   Or you lose your marriage and the enemy comes after your self-worth.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.800]   So if you're looking in the Bible, in verse 11, here when we meet the two main characters,
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:37.680]   you have the angel of the Lord, which my Bible commentary tells me is the incarnate Jesus
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.400]   Christ himself, and Gideon, who God calls him "mighty warrior."
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.320]   Now these two words, "mighty warrior," is the reason I imagine that Gideon might have
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.560]   asked the same question I asked God.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.720]   Why would you call me something that I obviously am not?
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:05.000]   You see, when God called Gideon as a mighty warrior, everything screamed that he was anything
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.520]   but a mighty warrior.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.960]   You know, do you remember how in PE in school, and the teacher asked you to split into teams,
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.920]   and you always choose the fittest, fastest person to be on your team, right?
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:22.640]   So here God picks and calls out Gideon, who not only is the smallest and the weakest,
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.480]   but he's never played the game before, he doesn't know the rules of the game, and you
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.800]   know what the worst thing is?
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.680]   That guy doesn't even want to play.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.600]   I mean, come on, seriously, God.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.520]   This is the guy you pick, you call him "mighty warrior," star player?
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.960]   So normally after the harvest, in the story, the farmer would take the grain to the threshing
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:50.000]   floor, and to separate the shaft, the useless part, from the grain.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.160]   So they toss it up in the air, and the lighter shaft would just be blown away by the air,
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.740]   and then while the heavier grain would fall onto the ground.
[00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:02.440]   So for this to work, you need an open air, where there is wind, which is why threshing
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.640]   floors are usually up on top of a hill.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:14.120]   So where was Gideon, this supposed star player/mighty warrior, whom God personally came to headhunt
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.500]   for the team?
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.640]   Where was he?
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.280]   He was as far removed from the hilltop as possible.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:26.720]   He was in a wine press, which is basically a hole buried deep into the ground, because
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.000]   he was scared of the million knights.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.360]   With no wind or ventilation, he had to work extra hard and make do.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:37.960]   I'm imagining he must be angry, and frustrated, and dejected, and all he could think about
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.680]   is "I just need to survive, me and my family."
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.160]   That's all he's thinking about.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:47.120]   But you know, no matter what trouble we're under, no matter how far we try to hide away
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:54.680]   from God, he always has a way to find us and meet us right where we are.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:19:01.280]   Because God is an expert at making all things work together for our good, even in the circumstances
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.880]   that we hate.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:09.140]   Okay, now, let's be fair and give our friend Gideon some credit here.
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:14.160]   He might be scared and comfortable, but he was so faithfully doing what he needed to
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.160]   do.
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.960]   Threshing, especially threshing so inefficiently, like I hate inefficiency, like, you know,
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.920]   it could not have been fun.
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:30.080]   But how true it is that it is often amid our day-to-day boring stuff that we come to experience
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.640]   God and his power.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.880]   So here we have God, you know, Gideon hiding and being super jumpy.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.400]   So does any of this look like mighty aurora like to you?
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.280]   And yet God is calling him that, mighty warrior.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.520]   Now the Bible doesn't tell us what went through Gideon's mind when God called him mighty warrior,
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:55.240]   but if God had called me that, I would have said, "Who, me?
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.240]   Who, me?
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.040]   Like, I really struggle with that kind of thing all my life, like, I don't think I can
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040]   do that."
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.040]   Yes, you.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.160]   Oh, no one in my family's ever done that kind of thing.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.040]   You know, I just can't see myself doing it.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.640]   Yes, you.
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.440]   But I don't want to look stupid, okay?
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.880]   I don't want to let anyone down, like, I've tried that before.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.760]   I wouldn't even know where to start.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.680]   And God says, "Yes, you."
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.160]   That's not me, that's not who I am.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.680]   I don't think, I don't want, I don't think.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.400]   I can, I can't, I can't, I don't want.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   Yes, you.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.600]   You know, don't get me wrong, self-awareness is important.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.480]   It helps us identify and assess our personality, emotions, strengths and weaknesses.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:45.000]   It is what saves you from going viral if you can't sing and you go on American God's Talent,
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   okay?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   That is important.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.720]   But the better we, and the better we understand ourselves and our tendency towards sin and
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.840]   weaknesses, the clearer we can see how we need to go.
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:00.480]   So healthy self-awareness is biblical.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.400]   And healthy self-awareness, on the other hand, is dangerous.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.480]   When instead of using self-awareness as a helpful set of observations, we take it on
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:19.480]   as our identity, our destiny, and our excuses for not trying to overcome sin and weaknesses.
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.100]   You know, for you and I, when we consider trying something, we make evaluations based
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:28.600]   on our resumes, you know, references, competency test results, bank balances, you know, people
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.260]   we have on our contact list.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.360]   God is not like us.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:40.440]   He does not call us according to our past performances, and he calls us according to
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.440]   our potential.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.960]   In fact, he calls things that are not as though they were.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:53.440]   Abraham was childless, and God calls him Abraham, the father of many nations.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:00.560]   Simon was emotionally unstable, and God calls him Peter, the rock.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.120]   Gideon?
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:07.000]   Well, God saw the potential in Gideon.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Gideon did not see it.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.460]   Nobody else saw it.
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:13.840]   Only God saw Gideon's potential.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.560]   Gideon didn't know that he was going to lead an army and win one of the most spectacular
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.880]   battles of all time.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.800]   He would be shocked, I think, to find that he could actually fight.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.520]   He didn't know that he was going to make it into the Book of Judges and the Hebrews Hall
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.760]   of Fame, and that thousands of years later we will hear in Gong Fuk Check Talk learning
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.040]   from him.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:36.000]   I think Gideon would be shocked more than anybody else to hear that he was the answer
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.400]   that he and his country have been praying for.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:46.960]   God did not call Gideon by who he was, but by who he was made to be, and by who he will
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.240]   become.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.720]   First Corinthians 1.26 says, "Think of what you were when you were called.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:00.040]   Not many of you were wise by human standards, influential or of noble birth.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.880]   But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise.
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.360]   God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.240]   God chose the lowly things of the world and the despised things, and that the things that
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:21.400]   are not to nullify the things that are, so that no one may boast before him."
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:32.680]   So the moment God called Gideon a mighty warrior, Gideon said, verse 15, "Excuse me, sir.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.680]   How can it be?
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.680]   I'm from the smallest clan.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:39.880]   I'm at least a family, and in case you haven't noticed, I'm literally in a pit."
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:45.800]   All throughout history, people have made similar attempts to educate and correct God.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.880]   Moses said, "But I can't speak."
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.880]   Jeremiah said, "But I'm too young."
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:24:01.240]   And I said, "I'm a spoiled only child, and I have elderly parents to look after, and
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.880]   whatever way you look at it, I just don't look like those super gracious missionaries
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.160]   who bake, sew, and homeschool."
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:14.960]   You know, it's so easy to talk ourselves out of our dreams and build a case to support
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:22.000]   who we think we are and dissuade ourselves from going forward.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.120]   We must decide who is going to win this internal war.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:34.760]   On one hand, we have the me I knew and grew up around, or the me I was actually created
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.760]   to be.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:44.040]   Whether or not we get out of the pit will determine the trajectory of our lives.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:51.840]   Recently, I had to drive in Congo for 12 hours, and the roads in Congo, I don't actually
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.760]   like to call them roads, because they're full of potholes, and I'm just, I am scared of
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.840]   them.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.840]   So my Superman husband tried to encourage me and said, "Just don't worry, you'll do
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.200]   fine, you'll do great."
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   And I went there and I said, "Oh, it's easy for you to say.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   I'm not like you.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   Stop saying it's easy.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   It's going to be really hard.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   Like, what if I fall asleep?"
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:19.320]   And as soon as I said that, God asked me, "Who told you that?
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:23.200]   Who told you that you cannot drive like Henri?
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.880]   Who told you who you are and who you are not?
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.080]   Who told you what you can and what you cannot do?"
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:43.160]   No one, not me, not you, not anyone can tell us who we were created to be except God.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.960]   If we live life according to our own understanding, it is a problem.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:52.120]   It is a, because it is a problem and it is a possible to, it is possible to go through
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:58.680]   life not actually knowing how tough and brave we really are or what we're capable of.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.760]   Only God knows our full potential.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.120]   We cannot lean on our own understanding of ourselves.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:15.080]   We must trust God to tell us who we are and what we are actually capable of.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:22.040]   Ask yourself this, what would happen if you stop hiding under the labels, images, and
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.920]   expectations that you or others have placed on you?
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:36.160]   God is calling and bringing forth the real you, the you that he created you to be.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:40.520]   Don't you want to meet the you that you have yet to meet?
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:46.320]   Today, just as God called the mighty warrior out from the pit of insecurity into his divine
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:53.600]   and plans and purposes, God is calling the mighty warrior out of you.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:58.640]   This is not for the sake of some self-gratification or self-actualization.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:05.200]   It is so that you can help others and perhaps even change a nation, just as Gideon did.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.720]   It is for a purpose that is bigger than you or your family.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:17.040]   You need to know that becoming all that God has created you to be is not about self-improvement,
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.640]   but it is the best thing that you can do for others and the best gift you can give to your
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.040]   loved ones.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:33.920]   Okay, so let's say I accept that maybe I can be more than other people think, and I accept
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.040]   that I have a purpose bigger than myself.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.560]   But I mean like how is that actually supposed to work?
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.360]   Like what am I supposed to do?
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.040]   And the answer is in verse 14.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:53.160]   Go in the strength you have and save Israel out of Midian's hand.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.440]   Am I not sending you?
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.240]   Go in the strength you have.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.520]   And I say, "Sorry, say what, God?"
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.280]   Like aren't you going to give me like some new ability and some new strength to do this
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.320]   new thing?
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.160]   Nope.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:15.160]   God doesn't do ready, set, go.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.080]   He does it the opposite way.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.960]   He does go and set and ready.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.160]   So go and start with what is already in your hands.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.560]   Go with those five loaves and two fish.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:35.280]   Go with five little pieces of stones and just go in the strength that you have.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:43.840]   Gideon's strength was small, but it was enough.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.080]   It was enough because God made up the difference.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.560]   Whatever we lack, God makes up for it.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:58.560]   Our strength is limited, but God's strength is unlimited.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.760]   Our strength is exhaustible, which is why we get exhausted.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.720]   But God is inexhaustible.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:12.520]   God never runs out of anything.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:17.320]   Now my guess is that if Gideon had been braver and gone out the next day together in an army,
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.120]   he would have won.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.860]   But he wasn't there.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.920]   So he took baby steps and God could totally work without baby steps.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.840]   Like he couldn't even summon the courage to ask.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.080]   He had to ask for multiple fleeces and signs.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.640]   And God wasn't annoyed.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.400]   God responded with multiple miracles.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.360]   Gideon was too scared to destroy the false gods during the day.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.360]   So when did he do it?
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:42.880]   At night when no one's watching.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.160]   But hey, he did it.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:50.520]   Verse 27 says, "He did as the Lord told him."
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:57.120]   God can and will work with whatever we have and are willing to give him.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.740]   So go in the strength you have.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.560]   Go in the time you have.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.840]   Go with the money and resources you have.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.840]   Go with what you know.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   Go with what you don't know.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.840]   Go with what you can do.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.840]   Go with what you cannot do.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.640]   Go with whatever you currently have, no matter how small and insignificant you think it is.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.260]   Go and God will make up the rest.
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:22.640]   Because when you go, God will then get you set and ready.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:28.840]   As Gideon gave his life to God and took baby steps, it really wasn't like God gave him
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:29.840]   a box.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.280]   You know, if you know Chinese cartoon, it's not like ding dong, okay, with a baguette.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.480]   It's not like God said, "Here, buddy.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.880]   Everything you have is in there."
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.640]   God himself went with him.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:46.240]   This says that God Almighty himself came on him and empowered him.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:52.200]   And as a result, because of God's spirit, Gideon became that mighty warrior who defeated
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:56.080]   the Midianites and freed an entire nation.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.880]   The Apostle Paul said this about Gideon and other ordinary people turned extraordinary
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.960]   heroes.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:10.480]   In the Passion translation, it said, "Faith sparked courage within them, and they became
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:16.600]   mighty warriors in battle, pulling armies from another realm into battle array."
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:24.320]   Another translation said this, "They were weak, but were made strong."
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:28.620]   They were weak, but were made strong.
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.320]   It was after work on a Friday evening.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:37.440]   My husband only got into a taxi to go home, and inside were two other passengers and the
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.800]   taxi driver.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.960]   This is very common practice in Congo to share a cab.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.400]   And the driver said, "I'm gonna drop the other two passengers off, and then I'm gonna drop
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.400]   you off."
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.400]   My husband said, "Okay."
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.840]   They started driving further and further away, and before you know it, they were approaching
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.160]   the boundary of the town where the police station was.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.000]   And my husband said, "You know what?
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   Just drop me here.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   I'll take another taxi.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   I didn't know you were gonna go this far."
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.800]   And the guy said to him, "Oh, you know, just if you say..."
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:11.760]   Actually, what the guy said was, "If you say another word, we'll kill you."
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.840]   That's what he said.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:18.160]   They drove further and further away, and they were soon approaching a roundabout, which
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:23.040]   my husband recognized, and he knew by then they were already 25 kilometers away from
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.440]   the town.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:30.440]   And one of the passengers then turned around to my husband and looked up and down him and
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:33.160]   said, "You're the surgeon from the eye clinic."
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.200]   And my husband said, "Yes."
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:39.640]   And this guy then turned around to his other passenger and the driver and said, "We should
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.840]   not hurt this one."
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.120]   They started arguing in a Cameroonian dialect, so my husband couldn't really understand what
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.120]   they were saying.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:53.400]   As they were busy arguing, my husband quietly slipped his iPhone out from the taxi window,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.440]   hoping that someone would find that phone and find him.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.680]   They continued driving for three hours.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:07.320]   It was getting darker and darker, and they were deeper and deeper into the forest.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:13.080]   And then suddenly, the kidnappers stopped the car and pushed my husband out from the
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.740]   car.
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.600]   My husband called this the most terrifying moment of his life.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.080]   He thought, "This is it.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.280]   They're gonna kill me."
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.240]   And then to his surprise, they told him to go.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.640]   They said, "Go, but don't you dare report us because we know who you are, who your family
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.600]   is, where you live, where you work, and if you do that, there'll be repercussions."
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.620]   And then they drove off.
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:39.760]   So while my husband was really relieved that he was alive, he now finds himself in the
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.820]   middle of a rainforest where there are gorilla, snake, scorpions.
[00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.960]   He had no idea where he was.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.720]   He had no idea which direction to start heading.
[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.000]   So what do you do?
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.260]   You walk by faith and not by sight, because you can't even see the fingers.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.160]   You just start walking.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:05.720]   And he called this the longest, darkest, most traumatic, stressful, and tiring night of
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.720]   his life.
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:08.720]   We're seeing the darkest valley, right?
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.880]   It was just horrific.
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:17.160]   And to this day, my husband cannot tell you how on earth, not knowing where he was, which
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:21.040]   direction to go, and not being able to see, how he managed to get back to that roundabout
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.080]   that he knew.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:28.960]   And he can also not tell you how on earth he managed to use his feet and find his iPhone,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:34.400]   and how on earth that that screen monitor was not damaged.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:37.640]   It was not even cracked.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.320]   So by midnight, our team realized that Anri was missing.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.800]   So a search party was going on.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   We tried to find my apps.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.080]   There's no phone signal, da-da-da.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.120]   And it was just...
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.640]   Everybody was trying to find him.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:53.520]   And finally, by eight in the morning, he finally had phone signal, called me, and then very
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.120]   soon after, he was home safe.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:07.560]   I just think, who gets kidnapped and comes home with his iPhone, Apple Watch, and wallet?
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:13.880]   To us, Anri really was not alone that night.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.600]   We sang it, "God is our shepherd.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.880]   He's with me, behind me.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.960]   God and his angels never left his side."
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.880]   Now after the abduction, we learned from the locals that during that time of the year,
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:29.760]   there are groups who would travel several kilometers from another country with the intention
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:35.920]   to kill or take body parts for human sacrifice.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.340]   We will never know the true motives of Anri's abductors, but given that they never once
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:47.080]   talked about money or possessions, it did seem that at least likely that they were after
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:53.120]   my husband to kill him and offer him as a human sacrifice.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:36:00.400]   There's this worship song that says, "If I'm not dead, then you're not done."
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:05.480]   So since the abduction, those lyrics are taken on a whole sort of different meaning.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:11.960]   We figure that since God spared Anri's life, he must have something more for him to do.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:17.120]   Since then, we have also developed a deeper appreciation of the Bible verse that says,
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:25.480]   "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:30.600]   Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that Christ's power
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.240]   may rest on me.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:38.560]   That is why, for Christ's sake, I delight in weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions,
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   difficulties.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:45.200]   For when I am weak, then I am strong."
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.480]   I think about the words, like, "I delight in weaknesses, insults, hardships, difficulties,
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.480]   persecutions."
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.000]   Let's put that on a fridge magnet or in a bookmark.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Says no one ever.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.600]   I mean, in our world, weakness is perceived as something negative.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:09.400]   And yet, in Psalm 84, 5, it says that God blesses all who depend on him for strength.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.080]   The weaker we are, the more we depend on God.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:20.160]   And the more we depend on God, the stronger we get, and the more blessed we become.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.240]   Now maybe you've not heard of that song about, "If I'm not dead, then you're not dead."
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.160]   But this one, I'm sure you all know.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:28.280]   It's called, "Jesus Loves Me."
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.840]   Jesus loves me, this I know for the Bible tells me so.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.320]   And then it says what?
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.960]   They are weak, but he is strong.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.520]   Okay, it is true.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:43.480]   When we are weak, then he is strong.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:50.640]   But actually, what the Bible says is, "When I am weak, I am strong."
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.360]   It's not just when I'm weak, God is strong.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.000]   When I am weak, I am strong.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   Who?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   Me?
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.600]   Yes, you.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:07.720]   In every situation, you, yes you, you can choose to tap in the power of the almighty
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.720]   God.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:14.400]   This power can set you free from sin, fears, worries, and anything that seeks to bind and
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.000]   hold you down.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.400]   This power enables you to become all that God has created you to be.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:29.200]   In Christ, we can be the person, the parent, the spouse, the servant, the child, the worker,
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:34.680]   the student, the mighty warrior we long to be.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.000]   God's power cannot be separated from his purposes.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:46.320]   His power is to enable us for his assignments for a bigger purpose.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:54.960]   Your future and the future of others depend on the decision you choose today.
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:59.160]   Today God has come to you as he came for Gideon.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:08.800]   Today God is giving you the same promise to be with you, the same calling to be a mighty
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.680]   warrior.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:17.160]   Your history and appearance may not be that of a mighty warrior, but your future and your
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.880]   destiny is that of a mighty warrior.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.960]   Get used to saying it.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:27.160]   I find it uncomfortable, but start saying it because that's who God's calling you to
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.600]   be.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:34.040]   Today God is calling you to stop hiding and come out of the pit to meet the you that you
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.800]   have yet to meet.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.440]   The you God created you to be.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:45.120]   In the same way he asked Gideon to destroy the idols, he's asking you to say goodbye
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:51.800]   to sin and anything you place above him, to say yes to him to be your Lord and personal
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:57.240]   savior, to worship him and receive his peace.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:03.380]   God is calling you to go make those baby steps in the strength you already have, resting
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:10.840]   in the confidence that God will make up for whatever you lack.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.840]   Who me?
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.720]   Yes, you.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:22.440]   Shall we pray?
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:28.080]   Heavenly fathers, so often we find it hard to believe that we are a masterpiece, but
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.960]   we thank you that we are your masterpiece.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:39.520]   Thank you for reminding us today that we are not defined by our weaknesses or feelings.
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:45.560]   Forgive us for the times when we devalued your design by comparing ourselves with others
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:52.720]   or by insisting on replacing it with an image of who we think we should be.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:58.120]   Help us not to lean on our own understanding of ourselves and our abilities, but to trust
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:03.960]   you with all our hearts for your opinion and plans for us.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:09.000]   Teach us who we are and who you want us to be.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.280]   Show us how to live and what you want us to do.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:20.080]   In every situation, help us stay connected to your power so that we can serve your plans
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:24.400]   and your purposes for your glory and praise.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.400]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.080]   Amen.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:27.920]   Man.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:37.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
