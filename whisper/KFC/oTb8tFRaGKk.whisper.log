[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:14.480]   Having an Easter Saturday service is always a dilemma for us at KFCI.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.040]   It's like a bridge between Good Friday and
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.240]   Jesus's sacrificial death upon the cross.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.360]   And Easter Sunday and his glorious resurrection.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:41.120]   Let us hope it is also a bridge to the return of face to face services next week.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.680]   What we have tried to do in response is to celebrate
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.800]   the death and the resurrection of Jesus in one service.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:03.240]   Our songs, our focus up until this point have been on Calvary.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.960]   And we will finish the service at the empty tomb.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.320]   And to do so, we have our own wish.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.520]   And it's this, the death and the raising of Lazarus.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.520]   And the statement from Jesus, I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.120]   John's Gospel contains the seven I am's that we have studied over
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.240]   Lent in company with thousands of other churches around the world.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.960]   And John's Gospel also contains the seven
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.480]   miracles of Jesus of which this is the last one.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.520]   Chapter 11 is a bridge chapter,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.760]   a very significant chapter in John's Gospel.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.400]   Chapters 1 to 11 talk about Jesus's
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.600]   earthly ministry, which lasted about three years.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.680]   Chapters 12 to 19 talk about things that
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.840]   happened in the week leading up to Jesus's crucifixion.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.920]   Now notice eight chapters, chapters 12 to 19
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.120]   are devoted to one week leading up to Jesus's death.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.160]   11 chapters covering three years,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.160]   eight chapters covering one week.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:57.560]   The death of Jesus is very important to him and should be to us also.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.760]   Therefore, chapter 11 is significant in that
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.600]   it serves as a conclusion to the first half,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.880]   as well as the introduction to the second half of John's Gospel.
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.720]   The chapter is also significant that
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.200]   it has the last and the climax of Jesus's miracles.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.800]   When I read it afresh this week, I was surprised.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.920]   No, I was amazed at how badly from a human point of view,
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.840]   it seemed to start.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.240]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.800]   We read how much Jesus loved Lazarus and his sisters.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:56.600]   We would call them to use Johnny's terms, BFFs, best friends.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.400]   Then Jesus hears that Lazarus is seriously ill.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.560]   He caught the first century equivalent of COVID and
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.280]   is in ICU on a respirator fighting for his last breath.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.800]   Jesus' response we read in verse six.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.400]   So when he heard that Lazarus was ill, wait for it.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.600]   He stayed two days longer in the place where he was.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.760]   Imagine me getting a call from one of the congregation.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.680]   Pastor John, my brother, my sister is sick.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.240]   I think they may be dying.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:52.760]   And I say, yeah, I think I can come on Wednesday afternoon.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.800]   It does raise a number of questions.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.920]   And I wanna look at two questions and then make a third point.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.840]   After all, all good sermons have three points.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.920]   The first one is this, why does God wait to answer your prayers?
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.640]   Let's read it.
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.600]   Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.160]   the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.280]   It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.400]   wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.520]   So the sisters came to him and saying,
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.040]   he whom you love is ill.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.760]   Jesus would often stay with Lazarus and
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.080]   his two sisters, Mary and Martha and
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.480]   Lazarus, even though he knew the pain the sisters were
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:11.360]   going through, but decided to delay the miracle.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.080]   Look at these words.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.080]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:26.240]   Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.800]   Instead of rushing to Bethany, Jesus stayed two days longer.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.120]   Why?
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.560]   It was actually because he loved Mary, Martha and
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.560]   her sister, and Lazarus, even though he knew the pain
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.840]   the sisters were going through, but decided to delay the miracle.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.120]   Now look at these words.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:03.920]   Now Jesus loved Mary, Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:09.160]   So you see the delay in responding to their prayers was not
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.080]   a denial of his love.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:16.160]   The separate mention of their names meant that Jesus
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.400]   loved each one uniquely and individually.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.800]   He did not simply love the family.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.760]   He loved Martha and he loved Mary and he loved Lazarus.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.320]   The individual love of Jesus towards these three is especially
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.360]   significant when we think of how they were different,
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:44.680]   both in their personality and their situations in life.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.040]   Church, we are the Marys and the Marthas in this story.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.840]   Lazarus is someone or something who is very dear to you.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.320]   Your Lazarus is ill and you desperately need Jesus to intervene,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.200]   to save your Lazarus.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.280]   The love of Jesus does not exempt us from the sickness
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.920]   and the problems of life.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:22.520]   How often have you prayed or requested Jesus to show up,
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.440]   but he did not?
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.040]   How did you feel?
[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:33.920]   Instead, he heard your prayer, but decided to wait.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.960]   His words to you, "I love you.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.400]   Your Lazarus will not die."
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:53.000]   To dig into this seeming anomaly, I want to look at a few more verses.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.840]   I've called this "When God Seems Too Late."
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.320]   So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.200]   But Mary remained seated in the house.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.720]   Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you'd been here, my brother would not have died.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:22.440]   But even now, I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you."
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:28.320]   Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:35.920]   Martha said to him, "I know he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:43.000]   Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:52.160]   Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live."
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:00.000]   "And everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.760]   Do you believe this?"
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.360]   She said to him, "Yes, Lord.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:12.200]   I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world."
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:19.560]   Now, when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet,
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:26.880]   saying to the Lord, "Lord, if you'd been here, my brother would not have died."
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:34.400]   When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.480]   he was deeply moved.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.680]   He was moved in his spirit and greatly troubled.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.760]   And he said, "Where have you laid him?"
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.960]   They said to him, "Lord, come and see."
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.200]   Jesus wept.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.400]   So the Jews said, "See how he loved him."
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.800]   But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.800]   also have kept this man from dying?"
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.560]   Now, notice the sequence of events carefully.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.720]   As I said earlier, after Jesus received the message,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:26.160]   Jesus waited for two days and then traveled to Bethany.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:33.280]   When he arrived, Lazarus had been dead for four days.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:40.680]   This means that the messenger must have taken a day to travel to Jesus.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.280]   Jesus took a day to travel back to Bethany,
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:53.240]   and Lazarus must have died after the messenger left.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:59.640]   I realize for the first time this week, you may not have spotted this.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:06.000]   When Jesus said, "This illness does not lead to death,"
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.600]   Lazarus was already dead.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:17.720]   Did Jesus make a mistake, or did Jesus mean something else?
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:24.600]   So Jesus's arrival is a little too late.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.160]   Or is it?
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:34.120]   There is a tension between two realities throughout this story.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:44.000]   On one hand, we are told of Jesus's affection towards Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.680]   But on the other hand, we notice that Jesus delayed action.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.200]   The sisters noticed this.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.560]   Martha said, "Lord, if you'd been here, my brother would have not died."
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:06.000]   Mary said, "Lord, if you'd been here, my brother would not have died."
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.160]   The Jews who were there said, "Could this man who opened the eyes of the blind
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.600]   also have kept this man from dying?"
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:26.520]   At times, the same tension exists in life.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:39.400]   We are told that Jesus loves us, but his inaction suggests the opposite.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.280]   I'm pleased to say my friend in Australia, Tim Thurston, is on the Zoom call tonight.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.040]   We had a conversation about 10 days ago.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:54.040]   Tim and his wife, they'd had their home and all their belongings
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:59.160]   dramatically wiped out in the recent floods.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.240]   It was an awful experience.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.120]   He was asking me, "Why didn't God warn me?"
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.760]   We were led to talk about Job in the Old Testament.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.200]   Job was a righteous man, and he suffered much.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.760]   He pleaded with God to take away his suffering,
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:24.520]   but there was no answer for a long time.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.200]   The same with Joseph.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.840]   Now, why does God do this?
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.960]   We don't fully know.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.640]   Jesus said, "It is for God's glory."
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.160]   Now, look at this.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:45.360]   What did he do instead of answering their prayers?
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.280]   He ministered to Mary and Martha.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.400]   We read, "He wept."
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   The shortest verse in the whole Bible is John 11, 35.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.080]   Jesus wept.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.440]   I've always been intrigued by this verse.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:10.440]   I believe that Jesus knew that he was going to raise Lazarus.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.160]   Why did he cry?
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.800]   I believe he was not weeping for Lazarus.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:26.200]   He was weeping alongside Mary and Martha.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.680]   Empathy is one of the biggest qualities
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:36.240]   we can exhibit as Christians as we minister to others.
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.600]   It is why sometimes those of us who have experienced
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.800]   hurt ourselves are the best people
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.960]   to minister to the hurting.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.200]   In the mind of the ancient Greek,
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.080]   the primary characteristic of God
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.280]   was this word apatheia, the total inability
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.320]   to feel any emotion whatsoever.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.920]   We get the word apathy from it.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.640]   The Greeks believed in an isolated, passionless,
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:14.480]   and compassionless God, but not Jesus.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.920]   Let's read this from Hebrews.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.880]   "For we do not have a higher priest who
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.160]   is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:26.400]   but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.800]   yet without sin.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.080]   Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.040]   that we may receive mercy and find grace
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.000]   to help us in our time of need."
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.760]   Jesus dignified the tears of those who wept in the Bible.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.320]   Abraham wept when he buried Sarah.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:54.200]   Jacob wept when he wrestled with the angel.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:57.160]   David and Jonathan wept together.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:00.840]   Hezekiah wept over his sickness.
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:05.440]   Josiah wept over the sin of his nation.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:10.120]   Jeremiah was known as the weeping prophet.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:19.280]   I believe that KFCI is called to be an empathetic church, not
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.920]   an apathetic church.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:26.760]   Jesus's interaction with these two sisters
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.680]   is as different as the sisters themselves.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:36.000]   Martha is extroverted and reactive, accusative,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.560]   but Mary is introverted and reflective.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:46.600]   Martha was disappointed, while Mary wept.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.960]   They processed the death of Lazarus very differently,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.280]   but both said the same to Jesus.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.200]   Lord, if you'd been here, our brother would not have died.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:02.240]   It is likely that they said this to each other several times
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.680]   since Lazarus dies.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.800]   Why wasn't Jesus here?
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.720]   My friends, it may look like God has failed you,
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:16.040]   but he will never leave you, and he will never forsake you.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.360]   He is a faithful minister to you.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.720]   Now you may be more like Mary or more like Martha,
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:29.440]   but irrespective, Jesus is here to minister to you.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.400]   With Martha, Jesus gave a listening ear,
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.720]   and engaged with her in conversation.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.160]   But with Mary, Jesus demonstrated
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.080]   an incredible empathy.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.080]   He wept.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:50.880]   Jesus ministered to each of them in the way they needed.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.800]   Jesus knew that Lazarus would soon be raised
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:56.160]   and that their grief would turn to joy,
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.360]   yet he took time to grieve with them.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.680]   He understood that grief is real,
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.760]   and they needed to take time to grieve.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.400]   Even given the reality of resurrection,
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.320]   grief is an appropriate response to loss.
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.880]   Jesus said to them, your brother will rise again.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.520]   Remember earlier, he said this illness
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.760]   will not lead to death.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.360]   Now it must have been hard to trust what he is saying
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.360]   or promising the second time.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.720]   However, most of the Jews actually
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.120]   believed in the resurrection at the end of the age.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.520]   So they were very likely to have also said to the sisters,
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.320]   your brother will rise again.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.600]   This is very possible because Martha responded,
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.840]   I know that he will rise again in the resurrection
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.000]   on the last day.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.480]   She probably learned this from childhood.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.240]   But look at Jesus's response.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:12.640]   He said, I, I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.600]   Now this is another I am saying of Jesus.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.040]   I am the bread of life.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.440]   I am the light of the world.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.520]   I am the door.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.960]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.760]   The resurrection and the life that the Jews were looking
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.320]   forward to, the resurrection and the life
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.480]   that the Jews were comforting with the sisters with,
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:35.320]   the resurrection and the life that Martha knew
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.160]   is found in Jesus.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:45.480]   Jesus is the resurrection and the life.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:51.280]   Jesus further explains, whoever believes in me, though he die,
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.520]   yet shall he live.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:21:00.320]   And everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:06.000]   Those who believe in Jesus will receive the resurrection power
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.320]   and the life that is in him.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.480]   They might die according to the flesh,
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.280]   but will go on living in the spirit.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.960]   Now Jesus had said in John chapter 5,
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.800]   truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.760]   and believes him who sent me has eternal life.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.560]   He does not come into judgment, but has
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.400]   passed from death to life.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.480]   Those who believe in Jesus have passed from death to life.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.200]   They were spiritually dead, but in Christ,
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.240]   they were made alive in the spirit.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.200]   The question Jesus gave to Martha
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:57.120]   and he gives to you this evening is, do you believe this?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.640]   Her answer, yes, Lord, I believe you
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:07.040]   are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.160]   Now why did John write this gospel?
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.080]   Well, if we go to the end of the gospel to John 20,
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.320]   now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of disciples
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.200]   which are not written in this book,
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.640]   but these are written so that you
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.760]   might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:34.360]   and that by believing, you may have life in his name.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:40.360]   My friends, we also should confess, yes, Lord,
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.920]   I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.880]   is coming into the world.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.440]   In fact, will you do that right now
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:56.560]   as we draw to a conclusion, an exciting conclusion,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:02.040]   a very exciting conclusion?
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:07.200]   After my two questions, my third point is this.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.440]   God keeps his promises.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.160]   Let's read it.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.920]   This is really exciting.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.600]   Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.480]   It was a cave and a stone lay against it.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.960]   Jesus said, take away the stone.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.520]   Mary-- sorry, Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him,
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.400]   Lord, by this time there will be an odor,
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.800]   for he has been dead for four days.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.880]   Jesus said to you, did I not tell you
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.880]   that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.600]   So they took away the stone.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.080]   And Jesus lifted his eyes and said, Father,
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.160]   I thank you that you have heard me.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:57.200]   I knew that you always hear me, and I
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.720]   said this on the account of the people standing around.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:05.520]   But I said this on the account of the people standing around,
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.040]   that they may believe that you have sent me.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.200]   When he had said these things, he
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:20.480]   cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.120]   The man who had died came out, his hands and feet
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:33.040]   bound with linen strips and his face wrapped with a cloth.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:41.080]   Jesus said to them, unbind him and let him go.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.160]   So Jesus arrived at the tomb and requested
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.760]   that the stone be removed.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.040]   Martha protested.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.080]   For a start, there would be an awful stench.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.960]   After all, this was the Middle East.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.040]   It was hot and humid.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.960]   We in Hong Kong know only too well
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.760]   what the humidity would be like.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.120]   Think of June or July.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:11.960]   Add to that a four-day-old smelly corpse.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.760]   But the real issue here is Martha's trust.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.720]   Is it hard for her to trust again this time?
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.480]   Again, Jesus' response was simple.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.160]   He simply said, take away the stone.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.560]   In other words, trust me.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.040]   It was up to Martha.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.640]   The stone could not be opened without her permission.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:47.760]   Will she and can she trust in Jesus this time?
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:53.640]   Jesus called Lazarus, and Lazarus came out from the tomb.
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.720]   He was brought back to life.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.120]   When Jesus raised Lazarus with a loud voice,
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:07.520]   it confirms Jesus' earlier statement in John 5:25
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.600]   that the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.120]   and will live.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.960]   It also demonstrates that Lazarus
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.040]   is one of the sheep who is recognized
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:23.280]   the voice of the Good Shepherd that we read in John 10.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.280]   Martha and Mary's faith was vindicated.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:32.040]   They simply chose to trust Jesus again,
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:37.120]   even though they didn't know what to expect.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.400]   The Jews believe that when a person died,
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.520]   the person's spirit stayed around the body for three days
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.000]   and then departed.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:53.240]   I believe this is why Jesus waited four days to demonstrate
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:59.920]   his absolute control over death and his own death eventually.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.800]   He was actually announcing his messiahship
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.000]   and left the authorities with a dilemma, which they
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.880]   tried to answer by killing him.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:15.520]   Only we know the end of the story, don't we?
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.720]   But let's, in conclusion, look at the big picture.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.560]   The positioning of this miracle in John's narrative of Jesus'
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.040]   life tells us that the event is meant
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:37.080]   to complement and dovetail with Jesus' own imminent death.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.960]   He has returned to Bethany to restore Jesus to life
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:49.160]   in full knowledge that he will pay with his own life.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.160]   Actually, only two to three miles
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.240]   from that spot, that very spot.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:00.240]   I mean, that's like Victoria Park from our KFC church office.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:06.360]   However, and this is important, Jesus' raising of Lazarus
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:11.680]   also prefigures Jesus' own triumph over death
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:16.560]   through his resurrection three days after his crucifixion,
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.880]   which the worldwide church calls Easter
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.440]   and is celebrating this weekend.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:27.840]   As the last miracle that he will perform in his life,
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.520]   it paves a way for his own resurrection
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.720]   three days after the crucifixion.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:42.360]   With the detail of the stone rolling away from the tomb
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:50.960]   also paralleling Jesus' revival of his friend Lazarus.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:58.000]   KFC, God keeps his promise.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.920]   God keeps his promises.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:07.600]   And that we can trust, even though we don't understand,
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.920]   like my friend Tim did in Australia.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:16.520]   God will fulfill his promise in his timing and for his glory.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:28.880]   As I ask my friend, I ask you, will you trust God again?
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.000]   Will you open the tomb of your heart
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.760]   and let God call out to Lazarus in you?
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:48.240]   But to do so, my friend, you must be willing to let go.
