1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,800
 We're continuing our parables, and Paul did a wonderful job last time on the shrewd manager,

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,400
 Gabe the week--I mean, Pastor John the week before on prodigal son, and Gabe before on

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,840
 the rich fool.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:29,920
 And so we're sort of on a trend here--lost son.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,200
 And before then, it was the lost sheep and the lost coin.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,160
 There was something that was lost.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:46,840
 And also, the shrewd manager, he also possibly lost something, right?

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,000
 He lost his job.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,240
 But he used it to prepare for the afterlife.

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,720
 Prepare for the afterlife.

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,200
 Now human civilization has always been obsessed with afterlife, right?

12
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,600
 We go back to the Greeks.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,720
 They thought Mount Olympus was the place for the afterlife, and the gods, Zeus and Poseidon,

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,720
 and they all determined whether you would go to the afterlife, right?

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,000
 It determined by your works and your sacrifices.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,560
 The Egyptians, they had the process called mummification.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,720
 It was to preserve your body, right?

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,920
 They took out your heart and your organs to preserve it and you preserve your body so

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,080
 that it would be there for the afterlife.

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:41,160
 Now, the Chinese emperor, right, he also tried to prepare and conquer the afterlife, right?

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,240
 He had--anybody been here?

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
 Anybody seen these?

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
 Yeah?

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,280
 It was beautiful, right?

25
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:56,400
 He prepared thousands of these things so that he could try and go and conquer the afterlife,

26
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,680
 conquer death, and conquer the afterlife.

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
 And so today, we're going to learn about a story that Jesus told.

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,280
 And firstly, we're going to read about the life, the life of two people.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,400
 Let's read together the life of these two people.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
 Let's read together.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
 One, two, three.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,400
 "There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, feasted strumptiously every

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
 day.

34
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:29,120
 And at his gate laid a poor man named Lazarus covered with sores who desired to be fed of

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,480
 the rich man.

36
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,280
 Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores."

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,520
 All right.

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,080
 So here we have a story of a rich man.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,840
 And this really poor person at his door.

40
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,400
 Anybody been to Mumbai before?

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,480
 Anybody been to Mumbai?

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,040
 And we're--in Mumbai, there are slums, right?

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,820
 And it's amazing, you know, Shahrukh Khan, you know, million, billion-dollar house right

44
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,400
 beside possibly the slums, right?

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
 These really poor people.

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,080
 And I've been into the slums.

47
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,760
 There's hardly any--there's no fresh water.

48
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,960
 There's barely any electricity.

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,720
 And it's the rich beside the poor.

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,720
 And in the same way, we have the super rich person here, right?

51
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,240
 Super rich person.

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,280
 And Lazarus is right at his door.

53
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,840
 Now, we see a couple of comparisons between the rich and the Lazarus man.

54
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,080
 The rich man and the Lazarus.

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,160
 So firstly, the rich man, he was clothed in purple.

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,320
 Do you know how they got purple dye back then?

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,680
 Do you know how they got it back then?

58
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,840
 It was from snails.

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,520
 It was a very expensive process.

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,600
 And only the richest of the rich people got to wear purple.

61
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,020
 That's why the kings and the rich people were clothed in purple.

62
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,120
 The Bible says he was a rich and luxurious man.

63
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,640
 And Lazarus was poor.

64
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,160
 And he was a beggar.

65
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,000
 This rich man was healthy and well-dressed.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,240
 And Lazarus was clothed with sores.

67
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,000
 This rich man was possibly very clean, washed several times.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,800
 And the Lazarus man was unclean.

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,360
 Now, this rich man, he was feasting.

70
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,440
 You know, here at KFC, we like to feast as well, right?

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
 He was feasting.

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,480
 And Lazarus, what was he looking for?

73
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,200
 He was looking for the crumbs off the table.

74
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,520
 As we see in the next slide, there's a quote

75
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,640
 by one of the commentators.

76
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,680
 And it says that food was eaten with hands.

77
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,520
 And in very wealthy houses, the hands

78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,360
 were cleaned by wiping them with hunks of bread, which

79
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,960
 were then thrown away.

80
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,840
 This was what Lazarus was waiting for.

81
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,040
 Imagine you are in a luxurious house, right?

82
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,160
 And instead of napkins, you're using slices of white bread

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,840
 to wipe your hands.

84
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,120
 And then what do you do after?

85
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,400
 You throw the bread away.

86
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,640
 You've wiped your hands.

87
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,200
 This was what Lazarus was waiting for,

88
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,400
 the crumbs on the bottom of the table,

89
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,560
 in which the rich people wiped their hands after cleaning.

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,400
 The rich and the poor.

91
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,640
 This rich man was independent, right?

92
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,320
 He was rich.

93
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,860
 He was self-sufficient.

94
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,560
 Lazarus was hoping to survive off the crumbs

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,440
 off the floor of this rich man.

96
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,280
 Now, this rich man possibly had lots of servants,

97
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,120
 people coming to his aid.

98
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,760
 What did this poor man have?

99
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,920
 Only dogs to lick the sores off--

100
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,440
 the dogs to lick the sores on his skin.

101
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,640
 Now, I've been licked various times by Uncle Vincent's dogs.

102
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,040
 I did not have any sores.

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,560
 I think it was because they liked me.

104
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:24,560
 What's interesting is that this rich man is unnamed.

105
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,600
 It's unnamed.

106
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,160
 But this poor man, his name was Lazarus.

107
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,880
 Do you know what Lazarus, the core of this name,

108
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,640
 the Hebrew core of this name, comes from?

109
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,760
 It comes from-- it comes from Ili--

110
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,260
 sorry.

111
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,760
 I forgot.

112
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,800
 Let me look at my notes.

113
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,320
 I-L-- how do you say it?

114
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:10,040
 OK, this rich man's name, Eleazar.

115
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,000
 Eleazar.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 I was tricking you.

117
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,280
 I didn't know it.

118
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,040
 Eleazar.

119
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,160
 Do you know what it means?

120
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,920
 L means-- what do you guys know?

121
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,440
 Teaching you Hebrew now.

122
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,880
 Kids on the phone, I'm teaching you Hebrew.

123
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,200
 Yeah.

124
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,840
 L means-- do you guys know what--

125
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,880
 do you know Superman?

126
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
 Supernan?

127
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,960
 His name was L what?

128
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,440
 He had a Kryptonian name.

129
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,880
 L, it means-- take a guess.

130
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,400
 OK, I'll give you three choices.

131
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,360
 It means man, first choice.

132
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,200
 Number two, it means good.

133
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,400
 And number three, it means God.

134
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,480
 OK, three choices.

135
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
 What do you think L means?

136
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,080
 I'm teaching you Hebrew here.

137
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,360
 OK, everybody wave what finger they think it is.

138
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,400
 One is man.

139
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,440
 Number two is good.

140
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
 Number three is God.

141
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,040
 OK, ready?

142
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
 One, two, three.

143
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:12,120
 OK, if you chose number three--

144
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,280
 Harper, what did you choose?

145
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,760
 Number three, very good.

146
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,840
 L means God, OK?

147
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,480
 So what from God?

148
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,280
 Help from God.

149
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,920
 Eleazar, it means God's help.

150
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,280
 And so interestingly, this rich man was not named.

151
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,920
 But this poor beggar, who was possibly crippled as well,

152
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,120
 was named.

153
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,720
 It was personal.

154
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,120
 God knew him.

155
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,520
 God helped him.

156
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,680
 Possibly he had faith.

157
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,720
 That's why Jesus named him in this parable.

158
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,560
 This rich man, what we can see is the opposite.

159
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,960
 His life and his identity was found in riches.

160
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,000
 It shaped, it defined him.

161
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,880
 And we also saw here that he was sort of unwilling to help Lazarus.

162
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,720
 Unwilling to help Lazarus.

163
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,440
 So this was the life.

164
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,000
 Two men, opposites.

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 One rich, one poor, one healthy, one sick, with sores.

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 And now we see the death.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,520
 Let's read together the death.

168
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,400
 One, two, three.

169
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,400
 The poor man died and was carried to the angels to Abraham's side.

170
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,440
 The rich man also died and was buried.

171
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,320
 And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes

172
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,080
 and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.

173
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,800
 OK, first of all, we see that the poor man died.

174
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,360
 OK?

175
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,960
 The poor man died.

176
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,840
 What about the rich man?

177
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,720
 He also died.

178
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,480
 Now there is a difference.

179
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,240
 What is the difference here?

180
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:03,040
 The poor man, there was no mention of a burial.

181
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,960
 Did poor people get buried back then?

182
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,400
 Not likely.

183
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,000
 Not likely.

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,960
 Actually, many of them--

185
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,280
 click the next two slides--

186
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,880
 a lot of them were thought to have been thrown out of the city

187
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,520
 to a place where garbage was burned.

188
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,160
 OK, anybody been to a third world country and you smell burning garbage?

189
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,040
 That's one of the most hated smells.

190
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,920
 I hate that smell.

191
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,120
 It's like burning plastic or something.

192
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,600
 Right?

193
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,080
 In third world countries, they do that.

194
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,840
 They don't have a garbage disposal system, so they burn.

195
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:50,040
 And possibly what happened was this poor man was not buried either.

196
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,000
 OK, it showed that nobody really cared about him,

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,320
 that he didn't have any money, that he was just thrown out like garbage

198
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,560
 into this pit of burning garbage.

199
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,520
 Lazarus, on the other hand, there was a mention of burial.

200
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:13,480
 Now, I was just helping in a funeral several weeks ago,

201
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,760
 as you see in the previous slide of this one.

202
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,440
 Now, this burial was beautiful.

203
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,400
 It had a beautiful ceremony.

204
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,160
 His life was celebrated.

205
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:23,960
 People came.

206
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,080
 Hundreds of people came.

207
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,560
 Back in the olden days, in Jewish times, they would hire mourners.

208
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,640
 People would cry.

209
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,680
 They thought, oh, the more people that cried,

210
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,000
 it meant that you were more important.

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,400
 Right?

212
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,880
 How many people do you want to cry at your funeral?

213
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,400
 A lot.

214
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,120
 Wailers.

215
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,360
 They would hire wailers.

216
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
 Do you want to hire wailers?

217
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,240
 Oh, this person's so important.

218
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,920
 I'm going to cry.

219
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,520
 Right?

220
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,960
 So there was a burial for the rich man.

221
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,920
 And he was possibly very rich.

222
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,920
 And so he had a nice coffin.

223
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,400
 Right?

224
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,600
 Back then, they didn't have coffins.

225
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,840
 They had-- what did they dig out of the stone?

226
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,960
 They had a tomb.

227
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,600
 That's right.

228
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,280
 They had a tomb.

229
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,120
 And those were very expensive as well.

230
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,680
 All right, so that was the death.

231
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,680
 Both died.

232
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,120
 One had a proper burial.

233
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:28,840
 One might have just been thrown into a garbage pit of fire

234
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,040
 outside of the city.

235
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,080
 Now, so we have life.

236
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,800
 We have death.

237
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,720
 What do we have next?

238
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,480
 We have the--

239
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,440
 the afterlife.

240
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,880
 Let's read together.

241
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,400
 Actually, we've read this.

242
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,240
 So let's just read--

243
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,360
 I'll just read the verse 23.

244
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,320
 "And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes.

245
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,000
 And he saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side."

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,800
 What is interesting here is that the dead rich man

247
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,800
 was not met with anybody after he died.

248
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,440
 But the rich man was met with--

249
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,840
 was the rich man--

250
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,800
 Lazarus-- what was Lazarus met with?

251
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,400
 The angels.

252
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,000
 And the angels carried him to Abraham's side.

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,920
 And what does it mean, Abraham's side?

254
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,560
 To be-- who is Abraham?

255
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,240
 The father of the patriarchs, right?

256
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,920
 So it must be a good thing.

257
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,680
 Abraham was known to be a righteous man.

258
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,920
 So to be at his side, it must have been good.

259
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,400
 You're beside Abraham, one of the most important people

260
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,360
 in Israel.

261
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,840
 Father Abraham.

262
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,920
 Father Abraham, right?

263
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,960
 Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, right?

264
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,200
 These were the important people, most important people.

265
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,960
 So we see that the rich man was in Hades, all right?

266
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,600
 Why was the rich man in Hades?

267
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,360
 Was it because he was rich?

268
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,080
 Is that why he was brought to Hades?

269
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,680
 And was Lazarus saved because he was poor?

270
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,760
 No.

271
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,720
 Because Abraham-- was he rich or poor?

272
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,800
 Was Abraham rich or poor?

273
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,640
 OK.

274
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,200
 Rich?

275
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
 Yes, rich.

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,040
 I was going to make you guess again, like my kids,

277
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,600
 my youth kids, get them involved.

278
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,400
 OK.

279
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,960
 Abraham was one of the richest people in the Old Testament.

280
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,960
 He had so much livestock, so many servants,

281
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,200
 that what happened?

282
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,520
 He had a fight with his nephew.

283
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,480
 What's his nephew's name?

284
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,000
 Lot, right?

285
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,840
 They were like, oh, we need to separate.

286
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,600
 You go left or right, you know?

287
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,680
 Because you go left and I'll go right, you know?

288
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,880
 Because we have so much stuff that we're just fighting.

289
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,480
 Our servants are fighting, our livestock are fighting.

290
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,760
 There's not enough grass to eat, right?

291
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,800
 And so they were fighting.

292
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,640
 So Lazarus was rich, and he wasn't in Hades, OK?

293
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,000
 And Lazarus was by his side.

294
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,680
 So what is Hades?

295
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,880
 Do you guys know what Hades is?

296
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,960
 Let's look at Hades.

297
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,440
 Actually, in the Old Testament, our equivalent of Hades

298
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,240
 was Shiloh.

299
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,840
 And Shiloh, or Shiloh, was a place of the dead or grave, OK?

300
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,080
 It says, because you will not abandon me

301
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,240
 in the realm of Shiloh, the dead.

302
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,520
 Now, the Greek word is Hades, OK?

303
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,800
 It's also the same, equivalent, the place of the dead.

304
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,320
 It's a place where the dead were punished.

305
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,080
 So in Judaism, that's what they thought.

306
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:55,400
 When you died, you went to a place called Hades, OK?

307
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,960
 And seemingly, as we see in this story, the rich--

308
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,680
 or not, the righteous were separated from the unrighteous.

309
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,880
 Let's continue to read how death is distinguished from Hades.

310
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,880
 Also, we see that in Revelations.

311
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,440
 Its writer's name was Death, and Hades followed him.

312
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,720
 So we see that Death and Hades are two different things.

313
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,640
 And we also see in the Book of Revelations,

314
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,480
 Hades will one day be destroyed.

315
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,640
 Let's read this in Revelations together.

316
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,520
 The sea gave up.

317
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,280
 Ready?

318
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,320
 Next slide.

319
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,920
 The sea gave up.

320
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,420
 OK, ready?

321
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,560
 One, two, three.

322
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,320
 The sea gave up the dead who were in it.

323
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,560
 And Death and Hades delivered of dead who were in them.

324
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,920
 And Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire.

325
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:54,200
 So Hades is sort of a temporary place for the dead.

326
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,520
 The ultimate final judgment is the lake of fire.

327
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,600
 It's called hell, OK?

328
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,400
 And Jesus says this word hell in Mark chapter 9.

329
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,720
 Let's read that together.

330
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,880
 If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off.

331
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,800
 It is better for you to enter a life maimed with two hands

332
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,920
 than to go to hell, where the fire never goes out.

333
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,320
 The lake of fire, hell, is the final judgment.

334
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,560
 Hades is the place for the dead, a temporary place for the dead.

335
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,920
 And it is a place where the unrighteous receive punishment.

336
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,920
 However, because Christ has died and rose again,

337
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,720
 he conquered victory.

338
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,960
 He conquered death in victory, OK?

339
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,800
 Jesus has the keys to death and Hades.

340
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,720
 He says this in Revelations 1.

341
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,400
 I am he who lives and was dead.

342
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,200
 And behold, I am alive forevermore.

343
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
 I have the keys of Hades and death.

344
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 And next, next, the righteous go with the Lord when they die.

345
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,000
 Let's read this together, the words of Paul.

346
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,200
 One, two, three.

347
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,480
 So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home

348
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,320
 in the body, we are absent from the Lord.

349
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,720
 For we will walk by faith, not by sight.

350
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,960
 We are confident, yes, we pleased rather to be absent

351
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,200
 from the body and to be present with the Lord.

352
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
 What is Paul saying here?

353
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,200
 Paul is saying here, because of Christ's death on the cross

354
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,200
 and his victory over death,

355
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,600
 we now go to the Lord directly after.

356
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,800
 We are present with the Lord.

357
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,760
 When we are absent from the body,

358
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,800
 we are present with the Lord.

359
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
 And so when Jesus died on the cross,

360
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
 there were two people beside him.

361
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
 Yeah, were they good guys or bad guys?

362
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
 They were bad guys, good.

363
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,800
 And one of them, what was he saying?

364
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,800
 He said, "I know you are the Christ."

365
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
 Right?

366
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
 And he believed in Christ.

367
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
 And what did Jesus say to him?

368
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,800
 "Today you will be with me in?"

369
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
 "In paradise."

370
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
 Paradise.

371
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,800
 So could it be that when Jesus died,

372
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,800
 the righteous now go with him,

373
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,800
 present with the Lord in paradise?

374
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
 So could it be that this person who died with Jesus,

375
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,800
 maybe he was one of the first people with Jesus in paradise?

376
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,800
 So Hades, where the righteous man is,

377
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
 where the rich man is, sorry,

378
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
 where the rich man is,

379
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,800
 is a place of temporary suffering and punishment

380
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,800
 until the ultimate final judgment,

381
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,800
 which is the lake of fire, the final judgment.

382
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
 Does that make sense?

383
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
 Yes?

384
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
 Good.

385
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
 You can talk to me after if it doesn't make sense.

386
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:27,800
 All right, let's continue to read Luke chapter 16.

387
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
 Let's read together.

388
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
 One, two, three.

389
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,800
 "And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me.'

390
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,800
 "And sat Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water

391
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:43,800
 "and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish and in this flame.

392
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,800
 "But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you in your lifetime

393
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 "received your good things,

394
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,800
 "and Lazarus in like manner bad things.

395
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,800
 "But now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.

396
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,800
 "And besides all this, between us and you,

397
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,800
 "a great chasm has been fixed,

398
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,800
 "in order that those who would pass from here to you

399
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,800
 "may not be able, and none may cross to us.'"

400
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,800
 So here we see the rich man in Hades,

401
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
 and somehow he's able to look up

402
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
 and he sees Abraham.

403
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,800
 And not only does he see Abraham, he sees Lazarus.

404
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,800
 What's interesting here is that this person,

405
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,800
 this rich man is begging to Abraham.

406
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:38,800
 So possibly in this Hades place, he has memory.

407
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
 It's interesting.

408
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,800
 He has memory of what happened in his life,

409
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,800
 and he sees Lazarus, and yet he still sees Lazarus

410
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,800
 as his servant.

411
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,800
 Okay, he wants Lazarus to come and help him.

412
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,800
 He still sees himself as superior.

413
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,800
 And he begs Abraham, "Send Lazarus to come

414
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,800
 "and dip the end of his finger

415
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,800
 "and cool my tongue with water."

416
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,800
 Okay, so once again, there is a contrast.

417
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,800
 But however, the roles have now been reversed.

418
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,800
 The rich man is now begging,

419
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,800
 and now Lazarus is in a position of comfort.

420
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,800
 The rich man is in torment and in anguish,

421
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,800
 and Lazarus is in comfort.

422
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,800
 It's interesting to see that this rich man

423
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,800
 still sees himself as superior,

424
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,800
 and Lazarus as the servant.

425
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,800
 And it's also interesting to see that this rich man

426
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,800
 is also different from last week's rich man.

427
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,800
 Last week's rich man, or shrewd manager,

428
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,800
 used his position and his power or riches

429
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:09,800
 to prepare him for what comes next.

430
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,800
 But this rich man did not use his power

431
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:17,800
 and position and possessions to prepare himself

432
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,800
 for the afterlife.

433
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,800
 This word, in agony, this rich man was in agony,

434
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,800
 and it's translated as grief or anguish.

435
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:34,800
 And it's only used several times in the New Testament.

436
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,800
 The one time, there's one time,

437
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,800
 is when Jesus was lost by his parents,

438
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,800
 Mary and Joseph, and they were in agony.

439
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
 They lost their son.

440
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
 Have you lost your son in the mall or something?

441
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,800
 You're like, "Where's my son? Where did he go?"

442
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,800
 He was, you know, Joseph and Mary were in agony.

443
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,800
 And another time it was used in the New Testament

444
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:04,800
 was when Paul knew that he was going to go to Rome,

445
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,800
 and he could no longer, this was the last time

446
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,800
 he would see his friends in the church.

447
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,800
 He was in agony. He was in anguish.

448
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,800
 He had lost, they're losing something.

449
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
 They lost something.

450
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
 What did this rich man lose?

451
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:29,800
 He lost his, what did he have that he no longer had now

452
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:34,800
 in Hades, his riches.

453
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,800
 He was possibly in anguish because he had lost his riches.

454
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,800
 Let's continue in chapter 16, verse 26.

455
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:48,800
 One, two, three.

456
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,800
 "And besides all this, between us and you,

457
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,800
 "a great chasm has been fixed

458
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,800
 "in order that those who would pass from here to you

459
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:03,800
 "may not be able, and none may cross from there to us."

460
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,800
 What is this chasm? What is this chasm?

461
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,800
 Some commentators say that it is

462
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,800
 between the belief of the law and the belief of grace.

463
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,800
 Some people believe this chasm, what separates the two people

464
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,800
 is those who know God personally

465
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,800
 and those who only know about him.

466
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,800
 Those are separated because of self-centered living

467
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 and those Christ-centered living.

468
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,800
 Those who live upon the flesh

469
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
 and those who depend on the spirit.

470
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:50,800
 This is the chasm that separates the rich man and Lazarus,

471
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,800
 the rich man and Lazarus.

472
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,800
 And now, the story takes an interesting turn.

473
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,800
 This rich man starts to care about his family.

474
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,800
 He sort of has a missional purpose.

475
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,800
 He's like, "You know what? Why don't you send Lazarus?"

476
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,800
 Once again, he thinks Lazarus is his amazing servant

477
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,800
 that cares truly deeply about him.

478
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,800
 And he wants to send Lazarus back to his brothers

479
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,800
 so that they would not end up in the same place that he is in,

480
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,800
 in anguish, in Hades, in suffering, in torment.

481
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,800
 And he says, let's read together, 1, 2, 3.

482
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,800
 And he said, "Then I beg you, Father, to send him to my father's house,

483
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,800
 for I have five brothers so that he may warn them,

484
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:46,800
 lest they also come into the place of torment.

485
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,800
 But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear.'

486
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,800
 And he said to them, 'No, Father Abraham,

487
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,800
 but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'

488
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,800
 He said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the prophets,

489
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:10,800
 neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.'"

490
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:16,800
 He's like, "Send Lazarus. If only they see somebody rise from the dead,

491
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:24,800
 my five brothers will come to know salvation."

492
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:31,800
 Some commentators say that the five brothers represent Israel.

493
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:39,800
 Judah, or yeah, Judah had five brothers

494
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,800
 in the family of Joseph and Benjamin.

495
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,800
 Joseph, Benjamin, there was Judah, and Judah himself had five brothers.

496
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,800
 And so that's what some commentators think.

497
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,800
 Save Israel. Save Jerusalem.

498
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,800
 Save my family so that they would come to salvation.

499
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:08,800
 And Abraham says this, "They have Moses and the prophets.

500
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,800
 They have no excuse."

501
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:20,800
 They have no excuse to know about salvation.

502
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
 They have no excuse.

503
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,800
 So we went through the life of these two very different people.

504
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
 We went through their death.

505
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,800
 We went through their afterlife.

506
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,800
 And this is the aftermath.

507
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
 I call it the aftermath.

508
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,800
 Aftermath is what is the consequence?

509
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,800
 What is the result for us?

510
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
 What is the aftermath?

511
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
 What can we learn?

512
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,800
 The first thing that I wrote here is duty. Duty.

513
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,800
 This rich man was given riches.

514
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,800
 And what did he do with it?

515
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,800
 It seems like he didn't do very much or nothing at all

516
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:17,800
 because the consequence was he resulted in being in Hades, in torment.

517
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,800
 What has God given us?

518
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,800
 What has God given us?

519
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,800
 Even the students here, what has God given you?

520
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,800
 What has God given you?

521
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,800
 God has given these things to us not just so that we could be blessed

522
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,800
 and enjoy all these things.

523
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,800
 God has called us to be good stewards of the things that he's given us.

524
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,800
 Whether it be our position, whether we're bosses or we're--

525
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,800
 whether it be our riches financially,

526
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,800
 whether it be our opportunities, God wants us to be good stewards.

527
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,800
 This rich man was not a good steward of the things that God had given him.

528
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,800
 He didn't do anything. He didn't help Lazarus.

529
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,800
 He still, in Hades, still looks down on Lazarus.

530
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:23,800
 "Go, dip your hand in water and cool my tongue.

531
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,800
 Go and help my brothers, save them."

532
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:35,800
 We've all been given a duty to be good stewards of what God has given us.

533
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,800
 What has God given you?

534
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:44,800
 Are you being a good steward of what he has given you?

535
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:51,800
 That's the first question we need to ask ourselves, duty, stewardship.

536
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,800
 What has God entrusted to you?

537
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
 And what are you doing with it?

538
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,800
 What are you doing with it? Are you wasting it?

539
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
 Are you wasting it?

540
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,800
 The second thing is decision.

541
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:10,800
 The decisions that this rich man made in his life,

542
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,800
 it had eternal consequences.

543
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:19,800
 Eternal consequences.

544
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:28,800
 Lazarus, coming from the Hebrew, Eleazar, our God helps.

545
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,800
 Possibly he had a relationship with God,

546
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:37,800
 and that was why he was with Abraham at his side.

547
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:44,800
 The decisions we make here on earth have eternal consequences.

548
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,800
 Eternal consequences.

549
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,800
 In the parable of the tenants,

550
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,800
 five was given, three was given, two was given,

551
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,800
 and then the manager left, and when he returned, he said,

552
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,800
 "What have you done with the five?"

553
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,800
 "I've gained five more."

554
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,800
 "What have you done with the three that I've given you?"

555
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,800
 "I've gained three more."

556
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,800
 "What have you done with the one I've given you?"

557
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,800
 "I dug a hole, and I hid it. I was afraid."

558
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,800
 "Oh, gang, I was very afraid."

559
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,800
 "I'm a gang, gang. Gang, gang."

560
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,800
 "Harper, gang."

561
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,800
 "He was afraid, and he hid it."

562
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:39,800
 And the manager, or is it the manager? Sorry.

563
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,800
 It was the, what was it, John?

564
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
 The tenant.

565
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,800
 >> Talents. >> Talents. Sorry.

566
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,800
 >> It's the master. >> Master, sorry.

567
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,800
 Master, the master of the talents.

568
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,800
 Did I say tenants? My bad. It's okay.

569
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,800
 I was tricking you.

570
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,800
 Thank you, thank you.

571
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:11,800
 He said, "Wicked servant, throw him out."

572
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,800
 Right? Where there will be gnashing of teeth.

573
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,800
 Gnashing of teeth.

574
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,800
 I'm so scared of gnashing of teeth.

575
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
 All right?

576
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,800
 Our decisions on earth,

577
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,800
 what God has given us, and what we do with the things that God has given us,

578
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,800
 has eternal consequences.

579
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,800
 One day, the master will come back.

580
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,800
 The ultimate master, Jesus Christ, will come back,

581
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,800
 and we will stand before him in the throne,

582
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,800
 and he will judge what we have done,

583
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,800
 whether good or bad.

584
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
 We have a duty.

585
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,800
 We have a decision.

586
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,800
 And we have been given opportunity to discover God.

587
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:07,800
 Each one of us in this room has been given an opportunity to discover God.

588
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,800
 Okay? This rich man was possibly also a righteous man,

589
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
 because in the previous verses,

590
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,800
 Jesus was talking specifically to the Pharisees and the rich people

591
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,800
 who had riches physically,

592
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,800
 but not eternal riches in their heart.

593
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,800
 It also says in Romans, let's read in Romans together,

594
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
 verse 18, chapter 1, verse 18.

595
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
 Let's read together. One, two, three.

596
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,800
 The wrath of the God is being revealed from heaven against all godlessness

597
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,800
 and wickedness of people who suppress the truth by their wickedness.

598
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,800
 Since what may be known about God is plain to them,

599
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,800
 because God has made it plain to them.

600
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
 For since the creation of the world,

601
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,800
 God's invisible qualities, his eternal power, and divine nature

602
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:03,800
 has been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made,

603
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,800
 so that people are without excuses.

604
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,800
 There is no excuse, it says here.

605
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:18,800
 God has made it plain, plainly known, his invisible qualities, his power.

606
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
 He has shown it.

607
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,800
 If you don't know the word of God, he's shown it in creation.

608
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,800
 There's no excuse.

609
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,800
 There is no excuse.

610
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,800
 This rich man had no excuse.

611
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,800
 He had Moses and the prophets as well.

612
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,800
 Some people don't have the law and the prophets,

613
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,800
 but what do they have? They have God's creation.

614
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
 It says it right here.

615
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:56,800
 His power, his invisible qualities, it's shown in what he has made.

616
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,800
 We have the opportunity to discover God, all of us.

617
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,800
 We all have the opportunity to discover God.

618
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,800
 Next, dependent, dependent.

619
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,800
 What was the rich man dependent on in his life?

620
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,800
 His wealth. His wealth defined him.

621
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,800
 Jesus says, "The rich man." He doesn't even give him a name,

622
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,800
 because he was shaped by his riches.

623
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,800
 He's so dependent on his riches that it defined who he is.

624
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:45,800
 KFC, what are we dependent on in our life today?

625
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,800
 Are we dependent on the number of zeros in our bank account?

626
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,800
 Are we dependent on our physical strong bodies?

627
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,800
 Are we dependent on love relationships?

628
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,800
 That will carry us through.

629
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,800
 What are we dependent on? Are we dependent on the stock market?

630
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
 Are we dependent on the banks this week?

631
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,800
 Are we dependent on the banks this week?

632
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,800
 Choose your bank wisely.

633
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,800
 What are we dependent on?

634
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:28,800
 This rich man was so dependent on his riches that it cost him eternity.

635
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:36,800
 Jesus says, "What good is it for a man to gain the world, but forfeit his soul?"

636
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,800
 You can gain the world, but lose your soul.

637
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,800
 Paul had a great example. This life is just monopoly money.

638
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,800
 It's just monopoly money.

639
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,800
 The last thing, the last D is this.

640
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,800
 Do you recognize that there is a Deliverer?

641
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,800
 And this Deliverer is Jesus Christ.

642
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:10,800
 He is the only person that we should be fully dependent on

643
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:19,800
 to be our Lord, our Savior, the bread of life, living water.

644
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,800
 He is that. He is that.

645
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:33,800
 Let's take some time to reflect on our life as the band comes up.

646
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:45,800
 Which one of these D words is the Holy Spirit and God speaking to you personally?

647
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,800
 Is it duty? Has God given you something?

648
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,800
 Money, power, position?

649
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,800
 And what are you using it for?

650
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,800
 Are you being a good steward of what God has given you?

651
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,800
 Are you being a good steward?

652
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
 Decision.

653
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:18,800
 Your decision on this earth has eternal consequences.

654
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,800
 What decisions are you making in this life?

655
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,800
 Are they impacting your life in the eternity?

656
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,800
 Discover.

657
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,800
 Have you discovered God?

658
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,800
 It says that there is no excuse.

659
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,800
 In this story, the rich man had no excuse.

660
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,800
 In the passage in Romans, it says there is no excuse.

661
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,800
 God has revealed himself.

662
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,800
 Have you chosen to know him?

663
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,800
 Or have you chosen to go against him?

664
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,800
 And what is your life dependent on?

665
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,800
 Are you dependent on riches?

666
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,800
 Are you dependent on your social status?

667
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,800
 How many likes you have?

668
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,800
 Are you dependent on your house, investments, stocks?

669
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:35,800
 Or are you dependent on the deliverer?

670
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,800
 The deliverer.

671
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,800
 The deliverer of our souls, of salvation.

672
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,800
 What is God convicting of you today?

673
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,800
 Which D word is he speaking to you personally today?

674
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,800
 Let's take a moment just to reflect, talk to the Lord.

675
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,800
 Ask him to speak to you personally.

676
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,800
 Let's do that for a moment.

677
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:37,800
 [music]

678
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,800
 Heavenly Father, we come before you.

679
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,800
 We thank you for the reminders in this parable.

680
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
 That this life is not just the end.

681
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,800
 There is eternity.

682
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,800
 The things that we decide on earth have eternal weight.

683
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,800
 Help us to make wise decisions.

684
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,800
 To follow your spirit.

685
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,800
 Help us, Lord, to be good stewards of the things you have given us on this earth.

686
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,800
 In Christ's name we pray. Amen.

687
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,800
 Let us respond with this song.
