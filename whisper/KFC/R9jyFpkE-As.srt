1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
 Thank you, Pastor Johnny.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,920
 Get your haircut, mate.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,680
 2020, that was the year that was.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,240
 I was talking to a pastor friend, Tim, last week in Starbucks.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,640
 Yeah, I know the coffee is really bad there.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,560
 And we started to reminisce about 2020.

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,880
 And some of the things we said were these.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:42,680
 You remember when the pandemic first hit and we became experts in sourcing masks.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,560
 Now I remember my last trip, Sandra and I's last trip away, we were in South Africa in

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,520
 February and at that time there was no cases in the whole of Africa.

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,440
 And I think Hong Kong was number two after mainland China.

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,280
 And we thought while we were there, we were going to grab some masks and bring them back.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,320
 And as we went into the shops in South Africa, everyone was like, "Where are you from?"

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,000
 And of course we said, "Hong Kong."

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,560
 And immediately everyone took two steps backward.

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,960
 Fast forward about two weeks, the virus started to spread to Europe.

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,200
 And I was in Tsim Sha Tsui trying to get some masks again.

18
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,680
 And because I'm tall, dark, and handsome, I don't want to do this yet, tall, dark, and

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
 handsome, they thought I was Italian.

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,160
 So they took two steps back.

21
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,200
 And what we did, and you can see from the picture, we managed to source masks from all

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,840
 over the world.

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,560
 Many of them had them shipped out by friends and family from around the world.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,920
 But then when the pandemic spread, we sent them back to them.

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:04,600
 Remember when you could fly out on vacation and did not have to quarantine?

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:12,640
 Sandra and I actually planned to travel quite a bit this year, as you can see from this

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,640
 photo.

28
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,800
 Yeah, right.

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,040
 Remember when we all became Zoom experts?

30
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,240
 We learned about things like Zoom fatigue, Zoom etiquette.

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,560
 Well, at least some of us learned about Zoom etiquette.

32
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,640
 There's always that one person on the call who forgets to mute themselves.

33
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,760
 Remember when we were scared of running out of toilet paper and we bought all the toilet

34
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,680
 paper and tissue available?

35
00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:01,360
 The latest Hong Kong symbol became displaying all your stacked toilet paper and tissue on

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,840
 your window shell.

37
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:16,520
 But remember, remember when the disruption of the pandemic slowed us down and some of

38
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:25,680
 us actually spent more time with God in his word and in prayer.

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:34,040
 Remember when we realized though, even though we were working from home, it can be tough.

40
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,720
 And for Sandra and I, our next door neighbors have now been renovating their home for 14

41
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 months.

42
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
 I kid you not.

43
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,240
 Nevertheless, there have been precious moments that we could spend with our children, our

44
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:55,080
 spouse, our parents that we otherwise would not have had.

45
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,960
 Remember when we checked in with each other to see if we were doing okay?

46
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:13,520
 And then we went out and we handed masks and hand sanitizers to those in need.

47
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,960
 Now this got me thinking.

48
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:23,600
 And then I saw this note, it's gone viral, hundreds of thousands of likes from a writer

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,800
 called Leslie Dwight.

50
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,840
 I put it on the screen.

51
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:34,400
 What if 2020 isn't canceled?

52
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,120
 What if 2020 is the year that we've all been waiting for?

53
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:52,920
 A year so uncomfortable, so painful, so scary, so raw that it finally forces us to grow.

54
00:04:52,920 --> 00:05:01,520
 A year that screams so loud, finally awaking us from our ignorant slumber.

55
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:09,600
 A year that we finally accept the need for change.

56
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,080
 Declare change.

57
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,360
 Work for change.

58
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,800
 Become the change.

59
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,280
 A year that we finally band together.

60
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,600
 This is all the next slide.

61
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,920
 Instead of pushing each other apart.

62
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:39,120
 2020 isn't canceled, but rather the most important year of them all.

63
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,840
 So yes, what if 2020 isn't canceled?

64
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,240
 What if 2020 is the year that we've been waiting for?

65
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,800
 I want to share with you a couple of months back, I was on a Zoom call with a number of

66
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,480
 Christian leaders around the city, different backgrounds, different churches.

67
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:08,640
 And each leader was asked to share what the signs of life that they saw in their life,

68
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,480
 in their church, in their ministry during 2020.

69
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,320
 Some shared that it was more family time.

70
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,200
 Some shared that there was a unity in their churches.

71
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,360
 Some shared a unity between the international churches and the Chinese churches.

72
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:34,640
 And what I was looking at around my screen was a picture like a jigsaw puzzle emerging

73
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:42,400
 as each person shared the signs of life that are happening in our city.

74
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,760
 I repeated the same exercise at Gong Fuk Church about three days later with international

75
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,360
 pastors around the city.

76
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:59,920
 And each pastor was able to share what was happening in their life, in their church,

77
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,200
 despite the circumstances.

78
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:10,960
 So what I'd like to do this evening is to look back at 2020 at KFCI.

79
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:19,560
 And I can say as your pastor, in many ways, this has been a very fruitful year.

80
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,400
 We have an amazing team and a vibrant community.

81
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:36,120
 God has used this relatively small congregation to encourage one church in Gong Fook Church,

82
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,640
 family and cooperation amongst the trilingual congregations and bridge builders with the

83
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:50,000
 1,300 plus other churches in our city through the One Campaign, through the three-day Esther

84
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,720
 Fast and various multi-church activities.

85
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,240
 Bonnie I want to honor Bonnie.

86
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,400
 Where would we be without Bonnie?

87
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,960
 She is the glue that holds us together.

88
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,600
 She's put together this amazing slide.

89
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:14,200
 2020 was a year for KFCI babies.

90
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:24,920
 Harper in January, Eliana in November, and Autumn just recently.

91
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,360
 This is significant.

92
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,160
 And I'll return to it later.

93
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:37,440
 In January, Brian and Marissa headed off to Taiwan for their mission, their future, after

94
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,680
 their wedding banquet.

95
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:51,600
 And I'll never forget Pastor James' powerful Chinese New Year message from face to grace.

96
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,920
 I'll remember February not only for my last trip outside of Hong Kong, but for the way

97
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:07,120
 that we as a church worked with the rest of KFC to secure and give out masks to the needy.

98
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:16,720
 And Bonnie, Florence and others extended this in March to include hand sanitizers.

99
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,320
 Hashtag one church in Hong Kong became our motto for this period.

100
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:32,880
 And we also did a combined service with other international churches, a three-day ester fast.

101
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:41,340
 The one campaign attracted over 300 churches and 48,000 downloads of the app.

102
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:48,720
 We complimented it here with the powerful Jesus is King sermon series from Matthew's

103
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,280
 Gospel.

104
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,960
 We did outreach with Christian Concern for the Homeless, as well as the trilingual prayer,

105
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,280
 the ester fast.

106
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:10,900
 I find it ridiculous to think that Michelle only joined us in June, given her amazing

107
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,260
 impact on community.

108
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,200
 And do you remember when we were allowed to eat dinners together?

109
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:26,640
 I want to honor Mel and Josh who for two or three years, almost four years, each Saturday

110
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,240
 of hosted dinners.

111
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:36,120
 And then Michelle hosted welcome dinners, started Bridge, which became Lighthouse and

112
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,400
 found herself a husband.

113
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,040
 Quite a productive six months.

114
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,920
 I loved our Revelation series.

115
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,360
 So many of our, sorry, I want to go back one, sorry.

116
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,080
 Our Zoom worship first.

117
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,960
 Zoom worship started properly in August, and it's been a brilliant way of doing online

118
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:06,520
 services in a collaborative and a community way compared to uni-directional.

119
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,520
 And I want to especially mention Paul and the worship team who've been fantastic during

120
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
 this.

121
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,040
 September, I loved our Revelation series.

122
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,980
 So many of our preaching topics this year were determined by what we felt God was saying

123
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,200
 to the church.

124
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,040
 And Revelation was a prime example of that.

125
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,480
 Following Esther, do you remember?

126
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,760
 For such a time as this, God very clearly spoke to me, "Declare a fast for Hong Kong

127
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,760
 and preach Esther."

128
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,480
 And that's what we did.

129
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,080
 And judges in those days, people did what they thought was right in their own eyes.

130
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,680
 James, Johnny, Michelle, and myself have shared the preaching duties.

131
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,920
 I regard the four of us like a jigsaw, and my heart for them is to continue to grow into

132
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,720
 the preachers and the pastors that they are.

133
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,440
 They're amazing.

134
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:07,160
 October, saw Johnny launch the Titus English-speaking youth group and a youth mentoring program

135
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
 for non-believers.

136
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:16,680
 And we've already witnessed a few new believers come to faith through Titus and are so excited

137
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,920
 about the future of all-age ministry here at KFCI.

138
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,160
 In November, we welcomed the new KFCI church members.

139
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,480
 And I've loved our Christmas buildup, the journey into Christmas devotion, and our Isaiah

140
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
 9 series.

141
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,640
 This congregation is unique.

142
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
 Look at that slide.

143
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:52,560
 Sandra, I, and our KFCI team love you all, and we'll treasure these memories of a very

144
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,880
 unusual 2020.

145
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:06,440
 And what church, what church anywhere could finish the year with an ugly sweater contest?

146
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,640
 Now I want this to be a bit interactive now, because I've been talking for a while.

147
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:17,760
 I'd like you to go to the chat line, and I'd like you to put down what was your highlight

148
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,260
 of 2020?

149
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,560
 So let's see that.

150
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,120
 Just maybe one word or one sentence.

151
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,680
 What was your highlight of 2020?

152
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,560
 Can you start to type it now?

153
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,600
 Please don't put down Johnny's hair.

154
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,160
 I see we have no highlights for 2020.

155
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,160
 Okay.

156
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,560
 Zoom prayer with global leaders.

157
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,800
 That's from Anthony and Lillian.

158
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,040
 Thank you.

159
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:56,000
 Any other highlights of 2020?

160
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,520
 Bringing a dear auntie to Christ.

161
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
 Amazing.

162
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
 Lighthouse.

163
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
 Baptism class.

164
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
 Yeah, we're going now.

165
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,120
 We're going well now.

166
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,360
 I think Johnny was telling me yesterday one of his highlights, apart from his hair, was

167
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
 discovering Hong Kong.

168
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,360
 You know, he likes to travel a little bit, but he was traveling.

169
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,120
 Getting to know people I've never met, Esther and Anson.

170
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,480
 Starting Home Alpha Florence.

171
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
 Wow.

172
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,400
 Rest and Fellowship from Lydia.

173
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,040
 Inviting family memberships to church.

174
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
 Youth ministry.

175
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,120
 Our planned community outreach distribution.

176
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
 Wow.

177
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
 Amazing.

178
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
 Amazing.

179
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,240
 So, highlights.

180
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,280
 Keep them coming.

181
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,720
 But I need to tell you, spending more time with family.

182
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,360
 Thank you, Sarah.

183
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,960
 Helping fellow building tenants get sanitizers and cleaning with COVID-19.

184
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,320
 Anani and Sincere.

185
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
 Lunches with Snelly.

186
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
 I like that one.

187
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
 Alison.

188
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
 Good.

189
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:10,160
 But I need to tell you that 2020 is over.

190
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,440
 Today is the 2nd of January 2021.

191
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,640
 Two, one, 21.

192
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,740
 And I sense God is saying to this.

193
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,360
 You know the verses, I've used them before.

194
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,640
 From Isaiah 43.

195
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,940
 Forget the former things.

196
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,780
 Do not dwell on the past.

197
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:40,260
 See I am doing a new thing.

198
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,540
 Now it springs up.

199
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,040
 Do you not perceive it?

200
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:53,660
 I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.

201
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,900
 Do not dwell on the past.

202
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:06,460
 The message version then goes, I love this, goes on to say, be alert.

203
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,660
 Be present.

204
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,100
 I'm doing something brand new.

205
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,100
 It's bursting out.

206
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,900
 Can't you see it?

207
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:26,460
 And the more recent passion translation says, I'm doing something brand new.

208
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,620
 Something unheard of.

209
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:36,420
 Even now it sprouts and grows and matures.

210
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,980
 Don't you perceive it?

211
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:44,420
 I'm going to be riding those two on my fridge.

212
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:57,700
 Now I do not think it is a coincidence that January the 1st, 2021 saw not one, but two

213
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:05,100
 KFCI couples married at our church.

214
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,900
 God's blessing on you, Hanani and sincere, Michelle and Philemon.

215
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:20,340
 Two couples in one day, actually two couples in just over two hours.

216
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,420
 I believe there is something significant about this.

217
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:31,100
 And I want to speak over this, that I think these two messages about marriages actually

218
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:40,220
 represent for us the relationship between Christ and his church.

219
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,580
 The church is known as the bride of Christ.

220
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:52,780
 And I believe that God is saying, I'm doing a new thing in my church.

221
00:17:52,780 --> 00:18:00,300
 Congratulations newlyweds, get ready church.

222
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:08,300
 The word out there on the street is saying that the COVID vaccine is the game changer.

223
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:17,700
 I see that, but I say Jesus is the game changer.

224
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:22,660
 Jesus is the game changer.

225
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,900
 But what of 2021?

226
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:35,760
 I already expressed at the beginning of the Revelation series, my sense that the church

227
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,940
 needs to reset, renew and revive.

228
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:50,060
 It's simply not an option for us to go back the way it was.

229
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:57,940
 And in that context, I want to share my heart for KFCI in 2021.

230
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:05,320
 And here I want to acknowledge the input from our team, from Johnny, from James, Michelle

231
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
 and Bonnie.

232
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:14,540
 What I'm going to share with you now is our heart.

233
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:22,840
 Now those of you that know me well, know I love to speak in acronyms.

234
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,860
 Acronyms make it easy to remember.

235
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:30,800
 There's a strange story on this.

236
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:39,760
 I used to see the word fat, P-H-A-T around and to me it just meant excellent.

237
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:47,180
 Until I realized I had a sweatshirt with fat farm on, which I understand is a hip hop terminology.

238
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:54,480
 And people used to laugh at me because I had a fat farm hoodie on.

239
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,120
 Until I realized that fat is actually an acronym.

240
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,920
 And fat stands for pretty hot and tempting.

241
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,160
 I mean, come on, I'm nearly 68.

242
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,480
 L-O-L, another acronym.

243
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:24,200
 So today I want to make a cameo appearance and talk about C-A-M-E-O.

244
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,920
 Today is just one day in what is sure to be a long year.

245
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:39,640
 2-1-2-1 is I believe a cameo for 2021.

246
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:47,400
 I'll say it again, 2-1-2-1 is I believe a cameo for 2021.

247
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,400
 Now what do I mean by this?

248
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,040
 Well, my C stands for community.

249
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:03,720
 We do not see church as a 75 minute service on a Saturday.

250
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:13,620
 Now not that the service is not important, but instead we see the word community, which

251
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:24,080
 also embraces the word unity, governing the way that we run the church.

252
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,080
 That's why we choose to do Zoom.

253
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,880
 Zoom's messy.

254
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,020
 There's always technical issues.

255
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:41,480
 But we choose to do Zoom because we're more interested in community rather than a production,

256
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,000
 which is easier to control.

257
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,920
 Our clans stand for community, life, and nurture groups.

258
00:21:51,920 --> 00:22:00,600
 And church, that is our heart for 2021, that every person who calls KFCI their home church

259
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:10,120
 is in community, either as a member of a clan or another community group.

260
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:20,820
 For 2021, we plan to start a men's community and a women's community to enhance bonding

261
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:28,880
 and allow those difficult subjects, you know what I mean, to be freely discussed.

262
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:35,720
 Now other community plans for 2021 include firstly, support group for leaders.

263
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,120
 It's a lonely life being a small group leader.

264
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:46,520
 And we intend to start a support group for all the clan leaders to join, but mostly for

265
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:54,860
 new clan leaders and also others who are interested in becoming a clan leader in the near future.

266
00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:00,080
 This group will meet once a month so that they can connect with each other and bounce

267
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:07,280
 ideas off because it will be a safe place to ask questions and bounce off those ideas.

268
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,880
 The idea is they won't feel alone in serving God.

269
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,520
 Then we're going to enhance our welcome team.

270
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,500
 Michelle will start a welcome team that would regularly meet the new people that come to

271
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,400
 our church every week at the end of service.

272
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:31,080
 The purpose of this is to welcome for the newcomers to feel welcomed and not to be missed,

273
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,840
 to feel like a family here.

274
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,560
 It's very easy sometimes in a big church, for example, to come into church and go out

275
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,320
 without actually speaking to anybody.

276
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,360
 Now this initiative works hand in hand with the dinner pods that Florence and Julian are

277
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
 leading.

278
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
 You heard about earlier.

279
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,800
 When they become friends with the newcomers, they would also be able to go out for lunch

280
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,560
 and dinners on their own, hopefully.

281
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,960
 Talking of dinners, you remember those?

282
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,580
 We're going to start a welcome dinner and join a clan.

283
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:10,440
 When the COVID situation improves, welcome dinners will happen every month for newcomers

284
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,740
 to join.

285
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,520
 They would be invited to join a clan that we will start another group like Bridge where

286
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:23,420
 all new people will be able to join and be comfortable to grow with each other in community.

287
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:30,280
 We also see this as a breeding ground for clan leaders.

288
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,840
 And lastly, clan visits.

289
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:38,840
 Michelle will visit different clans to understand the needs and development to support them.

290
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,480
 The purpose is to know that the church is caring for their groups as well as for the

291
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,120
 congregants to have access to pastoral members.

292
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,920
 This will also allow the clan leaders to gain some support or suggestions if they ask for

293
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,520
 them.

294
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,400
 So yes, church, C is definitely for community.

295
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:10,680
 But if C is for community, then A is for all age ministry.

296
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,040
 I want to give you a little bit of background.

297
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:21,080
 We started KFCI as a response to the vast number of younger people either drifting from

298
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,560
 KFC church or migrating to an international congregation.

299
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:34,760
 The expectation from outside was of a young people's service with the prodigals returning.

300
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,800
 I have to say that was never our intention.

301
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:47,880
 Rather to create an alternative service that would appeal to a multi-generational audience

302
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,920
 in a style that younger people would also be attracted to.

303
00:25:52,920 --> 00:26:00,960
 Of preaching a message that would be as relevant on Monday to Friday as it was at the weekend.

304
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,960
 Thanks to SCP, Titus, various initiatives, we have attracted a younger crowd and also

305
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,920
 at the same time managed to encourage an older audience.

306
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,480
 But the gap has been the young parents.

307
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,160
 Mainly due to the service time and the fact that we haven't put any specific thing on

308
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,160
 for them.

309
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:35,000
 Now it's been exciting watching the KFC family grow this year in the most natural way possible.

310
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:41,320
 Four first born babies born to three of our young married couples.

311
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:49,080
 It really reinforces our desire and our need to grow our children's ministry as we recognize

312
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:59,000
 that church is for all ages and the community is life and is best done cross-generationally.

313
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,560
 Titus has been a powerful move in that direction from the other end.

314
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,400
 But I'm pleased to tell you that a group of our people, too many for me to name them all,

315
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:20,000
 are seeking God's heart for an all age ministry that is not a cut and paste of traditional

316
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,240
 Sunday school or children's church, but one tailor made for KFCI.

317
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,520
 I have something else exciting to announce.

318
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,720
 I want to also mention something that really excites me personally.

319
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,360
 I've called it our G5 project.

320
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:47,360
 Now what that means is every time there is a fifth Saturday in a month, we will have

321
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,200
 a sermon brought to us by a next generation speaker.

322
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,120
 So that will mean four times in 2021.

323
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,840
 And I'm pleased to announce that as part of our One Peter series, so we're going to be

324
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,920
 doing One Peter, and then we're going to be looking at Mark as part of the One campaign.

325
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,360
 Then we're going to be doing Two Peter, and then we're going to be doing Women of the

326
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,840
 Old Testament.

327
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:21,080
 But as part of our One Peter series, a sermon on the 30th of January will be brought to

328
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,360
 you by our own Dave.

329
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,560
 Let's have a cheer for that one.

330
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:32,200
 And the plan is we will help them in their preparation and delivery and develop an army

331
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,680
 of preachers for the future.

332
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:45,280
 So if C is for community, A is for all age ministry, then M is for mission.

333
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:54,560
 Now one might be tempted to say that mission has been thwarted, curtailed by COVID.

334
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:01,200
 Now whilst I do understand this, it would be wider the mark.

335
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,680
 Mission in the book of Acts started in Jerusalem and Samaria before the ends of the earth.

336
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,000
 Hong Kong is our mission field.

337
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,240
 Only about 12 people go on an overseas mission trip, but we are all on mission.

338
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,080
 What I do promise you is that when we can safely travel, that Sandra and I have committed

339
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:33,680
 to lead a team to the Philippines or somewhere similar in Asia to demonstrate how we personally

340
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,520
 lead a mission team.

341
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,160
 This is part of our vision to raise future leaders.

342
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:46,640
 But what will be happening in the meantime is that we will be organizing at least one

343
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,480
 local mission trip every month.

344
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,200
 Johnny and Bonnie will be organizing this.

345
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,980
 So if your name is Johnny, Bonnie, Ronnie or Connie, it is for you.

346
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,480
 You are all invited to be part of this.

347
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,200
 And the key for us is partnerships.

348
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:15,000
 I want to particularly mention Young Life through James, Love Action through Agnes.

349
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,480
 2020 has seen us reach out to students at high schools locally and interaction with

350
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,920
 many who come from non-Christian backgrounds.

351
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,600
 Johnny and of course James in particular will be working alongside our partners, whether

352
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:41,640
 it be online or in person to extend our reach and expand our sharing of the gospel.

353
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:50,640
 So if C is for community, A is for all age ministry, M is for mission, then E is for

354
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,800
 evangelism.

355
00:30:53,800 --> 00:31:02,440
 So all I've said, it is important to make the main event, the main event, leading souls

356
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,640
 to Christ.

357
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:11,800
 It is easy to hide behind the so-called evangelists in church.

358
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:17,120
 I look at Johnny, man, if Johnny asked you to come and play basketball with him after

359
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,240
 COVID, man, in three days, you'll be a Christian.

360
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,960
 He is a natural evangelist.

361
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,120
 I see my own gifting as being that of an evangelist.

362
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:36,960
 But there's the problem, leaving the evangelism to those who are apparently gifted, when we

363
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,120
 can all, all of us have the gift of evangelism.

364
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,360
 I'm talking to you, you, yeah, the quiet introvert.

365
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,520
 You've probably got your screen on black at the moment.

366
00:31:51,520 --> 00:32:00,000
 It is our aim to raise up a church who can freely share the gospel at work, in your family

367
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,040
 and friends.

368
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:08,520
 And Johnny will be starting a training on how to share the gospel.

369
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:16,720
 Johnny and Bonnie will be planning local outreaches and we will regularly give people the opportunities

370
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,440
 to receive Christ in our services and our meetings.

371
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,920
 And then there is Alpha.

372
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:36,320
 Sandra and I led our first Alpha group in Hong Kong 26 years ago this month.

373
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,320
 We have seen hundreds of lives transformed by this wonderful course.

374
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,160
 But now we have an opportunity for now, Alpha is online.

375
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,440
 I don't want to wait till things are going back to normal.

376
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:58,400
 And so the news is that KFCI, after Chinese New Year, I will personally be leading an

377
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,160
 Alpha course here at this church.

378
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,960
 If you'd like to be part of this and help us on this course, we can attract people outside

379
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
 Hong Kong as well in this.

380
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,000
 This is an opportunity for us as a church.

381
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:23,600
 So if you are excited, as I am obviously, about CAME, wait for this.

382
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,760
 O is for one.

383
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:35,640
 When we add all this together, we come up with just one word.

384
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,840
 And it's this one.

385
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,520
 One.

386
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,040
 Everything I have spoken about points to one church.

387
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:55,120
 A multilingual, multicultural, multigenerational church in unity, community, with a heart for

388
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,760
 mission and evangelism.

389
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:03,400
 Let me say that again, because that describes the sort of church I want to be part of and

390
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,040
 the church that I see at KFCI.

391
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:14,240
 A multilingual, multicultural, multigenerational church in unity, community, with a heart for

392
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,240
 mission and evangelism.

393
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,640
 That's what gets me up in the morning.

394
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,660
 Division in the church breeds atheism in the world.

395
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:32,840
 The unity of the church breeds the aroma of belief.

396
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:42,040
 And I want to share with you as I come towards a conclusion, a story of how small seeds started

397
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:50,000
 right here in our church can extend to the whole world.

398
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,640
 One morning about three and a half years ago, Pastor Peter and I were having breakfast with

399
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:01,320
 Morgan Jackson of Faith Comes by Hearing at FCC.

400
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:10,520
 We had a seed, a germ of an idea to link the churches of Hong Kong in a Bible listening

401
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:13,240
 program.

402
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:19,000
 A week or so later, I was in Pacific Coffee in the Vine Center in Wanshire with Pastor

403
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,800
 Alex from St. Andrews.

404
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:35,320
 We came up with the name One and the expression One Church, One City, One Lord, One Word.

405
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:46,440
 As I said earlier, around 48,000 Hong Kong Christians from over 300 churches in six languages

406
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,280
 have joined in our One campaign.

407
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,780
 And I got an up-to-date figure today from midday today.

408
00:35:53,780 --> 00:36:00,960
 As of midday, 50,912 people have downloaded the One app.

409
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,760
 And the good news is that not only will we be joining together with the other churches

410
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:14,080
 in Hong Kong from February the 17th to April the 4th to listen to the Gospel of Mark and

411
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:21,480
 the Book of Romans together, that we will be joined by Christians from all across the

412
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:30,800
 world, from cities as far afield as Kansas City, Accra in Ghana, Singapore, Ansan City

413
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,560
 in South Korea, Indonesia, and other cities.

414
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:49,720
 A seed literally planted here at KFCI that is literally producing fruit all over the

415
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,000
 earth.

416
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,400
 And there's more.

417
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:03,800
 Tonight we have a special first.

418
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:10,120
 We are going to be the first church anywhere in the world, I mean this, right?

419
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:18,520
 The first church anywhere in the world to sing an amazing new song.

420
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:25,040
 It's called One and it was written by Professor Daniel K.L.

421
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,880
 Chua here at Hong Kong University.

422
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,720
 My teeth got mixed up, Professor Daniel Chua here at Hong Kong University.

423
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:45,120
 I want us to look at it and to ponder it because the words now as I conclude my sermon, as

424
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:54,600
 they express everything that is in my heart for us as a church in 2020.

425
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,400
 Now we're not going to turn the mutes off, but as I read it, I want you to read it out

426
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,080
 loud and then after that, we're going to sing it together.

427
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
 Ready?

428
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,040
 One, two, three.

429
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,680
 One King, one kingdom, one God over all.

430
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,040
 One church, one witness, one mission, one call.

431
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:27,960
 Proclaiming salvation in Jesus alone, the hope of the nations made known.

432
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
 Next verse.

433
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,960
 One way, one truth, one life unites us all.

434
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,220
 One faith, one savior, Christ is all in all.

435
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,240
 Come every nation, tribe and tongue.

436
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,720
 Call on him, he is the one.

437
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:58,920
 And the chorus goes, let the people sing and the nations bring sacrifice of praises to

438
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,840
 our King.

439
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:10,040
 Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess, Jesus Christ is Lord of glory now.

440
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:17,280
 Restored, forgiven, redeemed by his blood.

441
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:26,080
 We rise commissioned in the power of his love, extending his peace to the ends of the earth.

442
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,560
 His justice and mercy will reign.

443
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:40,320
 One day all nations in a symphony of praise shall see his glory and the triumph of his

444
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,600
 grace.

445
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,120
 Jesus is Lord.

446
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,440
 Yes, he is the one.

447
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,120
 His will is done.

448
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,120
 Kingdom come.

449
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:00,400
 One King, one kingdom shall ever endure.

450
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,480
 One bride respondent forever secure.

451
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,160
 We are his people and he is our God.

452
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,720
 United as one we shall reign.

453
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,440
 No death, no sorrow.

454
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,000
 Our tears are wiped away.

455
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,820
 No more tomorrow.

456
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,360
 His light becomes our day.

457
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:35,920
 The nations rejoice in the splendor of his reign and crown him the lamb who was slain.

458
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,680
 Let us pray as Paul gets ready to lead us in this.

459
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:46,080
 Father God, we thank you for the signs of life that we see here in this church, in this

460
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,840
 city in 2020.

461
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,640
 We commit 2021.

462
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:00,600
 We commit that we would become a church, Lord of community, of all age, of mission, of evangelism.

463
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:07,000
 But most importantly, we would be a church that would celebrate our oneness with you.

464
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,440
 And as we sing this song, Lord, fill us again with your Holy Spirit.

465
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:22,040
 As we commit our lives afresh to you, use us as your church, as one church in 2021.

466
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,920
 Jesus name. Amen. Let's sing this together.
