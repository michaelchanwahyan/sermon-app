1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,840
 Pastor Johnny is on his way back from Canada.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,960
 And with no flights from Canada to Hong Kong

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,000
 until at least March the 4th,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,920
 he has had to route via Abu Dhabi and now Thailand.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,120
 At least we have him in the same time zone.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,440
 Please pray for him.

8
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,520
 But today's topic is Sabbath.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,640
 And you know, Hong Kong does not do this well.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,560
 And I'll be honest, I do not do it well.

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:52,200
 That's why I need to preach this message

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,480
 because I am the one who needs to hear it.

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,960
 Pastor James touched on the gift of limits last week.

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,440
 And I wanna talk about the one thing

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,440
 that we all have a limitation on, which is time.

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,480
 Time is the one thing we cannot make any more of.

17
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,960
 You can't buy it, you can't sell it,

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,400
 you can't steal it, you can't trade it.

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,240
 There are 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day,

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,160
 seven days in a week.

21
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,400
 There will never be any more

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,360
 and there will never be any less.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,520
 Because of that, we all have a tenuous relationship

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,120
 with time.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,560
 I've mentioned already in this series,

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,400
 you go up to someone in Hong Kong and you say,

27
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,440
 "How are you?"

28
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,960
 What do they say?

29
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,520
 "I'm busy."

30
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,400
 And we are busy at work.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,400
 And technology has only made it worse.

32
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,000
 We carry our office with us.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,880
 Oh man, I hate these WhatsApps, I get 1145 at night.

34
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,520
 But also we're busy at play.

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
 Do you remember dinners?

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,120
 Yeah, Hong Kong apparently has 15,000 plus restaurants

37
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,320
 and many of us seem keen or working to try them all out.

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,640
 We can be so busy

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,680
 that we can lose our grip on life.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,160
 We can lose our grip on joy, on peace.

41
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,040
 I don't know about you, I've actually appreciated

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,520
 this current quieter season.

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,400
 But you know, busyness does not equate

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,040
 to emotional health.

45
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,120
 Busyness gets past our schedule

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,000
 and into our personal state.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Tonight, I'm gonna start a rebellion.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Yeah, a rebellion against the prevailing Hong Kong culture.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,480
 As Rafiki in "The Lion King" says,

50
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,480
 "It is time, enough is enough."

51
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,240
 And it all starts for us.

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,160
 In Genesis one, in the story of creation,

53
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,360
 Bonnie read it for us beautifully, I might add.

54
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,960
 She read this, "In the beginning,

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,280
 God created the heavens and the earth."

56
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,280
 And then 30 verses later, "And God saw everything he'd made

57
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,960
 and behold, it was very good.

58
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,960
 And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."

59
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,000
 So there we have it, right?

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,320
 God has worked hard for six days

61
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,160
 to create the heavens and the earth,

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,760
 light and dark, sun, moon, stars, land, plant, seas,

63
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,600
 fish and birds, animals,

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,440
 and finally the pinnacle of his creation, humans.

65
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,360
 But look at what comes next.

66
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
 Chapter two, "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,880
 and all the host of them.

68
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,800
 And on the seventh day,

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,000
 God finished his work that he had done.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,440
 And he rested on the seventh day

71
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,520
 from all his work that he had done.

72
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,640
 So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,640
 because on it, God rested from all his work

74
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,840
 that he had done in creation."

75
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,120
 God rested.

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,520
 Let that sink in.

77
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,640
 God himself rested.

78
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,560
 After six days of universe making work,

79
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,760
 God said, "That's enough."

80
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,160
 Now was God tired and needed a rest?

81
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
 Not at all.

82
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,320
 Actually, the Hebrew word for rested is Shabbat.

83
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,040
 From where we get Sabbath from.

84
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,240
 It means to rest, to cease, to be done.

85
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,960
 It almost conjures a picture of kicking back

86
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
 and looking at what's been done and saying,

87
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,320
 "Hey, hey, that's not a bad job."

88
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,200
 I mean, that moon was pretty neat.

89
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,960
 An alternative translation for Shabbat

90
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,000
 is to celebrate a day in the week that is set aside

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,400
 just to enjoy and to delight.

92
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,800
 And that's the same for us.

93
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,800
 You see, God worked for six days and rested for one.

94
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,960
 And in doing so,

95
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,960
 he built a rhythm into the fabric of creation.

96
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,960
 As human beings who are created in God's image,

97
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,440
 remember that from Genesis 1,

98
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,680
 we work for six days like God

99
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,200
 and we rest for the seventh, just like God did.

100
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,640
 Now notice two things in the story before we moved on.

101
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,040
 I've put verse three on the screen.

102
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,040
 Firstly, it says God blessed the seventh day.

103
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,860
 God blessed the seventh day.

104
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,860
 In Genesis 1 and 2, God blesses three things.

105
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:18,440
 He blesses animals, humans, and the Sabbath.

106
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:26,880
 Now he blessed animals and humans

107
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,320
 with a life-giving ability to procreate.

108
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,320
 Didn't he say, "Be fruitful, multiply and fill the earth."

109
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,840
 God blessed Adam and Eve.

110
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,040
 Then a few verses later, we read,

111
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,040
 "So God blessed the seventh day."

112
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,800
 What does that mean?

113
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,800
 It means that the Sabbath has a life-giving ability

114
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,560
 to fill the earth with more life.

115
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,140
 Let's be honest, life is tiring.

116
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:12,680
 Work no matter how much you love it, depletes your energy.

117
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,360
 Rest on the other hand, refills you with life.

118
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,200
 So yes, firstly, God blessed the seventh day.

119
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,920
 And then we read, "And then he made it holy."

120
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:35,080
 Now you might've heard about the law of first mention.

121
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,440
 It simply means that the very first time

122
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,920
 an important word or phrase is mentioned in Scripture

123
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,800
 is significant because the meaning behind

124
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,800
 that first mention often establishes a precedent

125
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
 or a pattern that could be seen

126
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,720
 throughout the rest of the Bible.

127
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,800
 The first mention almost always contains

128
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,800
 the most complete and accurate meaning of the word.

129
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,280
 This not only serves as a key to understanding

130
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,480
 the word's biblical concept,

131
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,480
 but it also provides a foundation for its fuller development

132
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,240
 in later parts of the Bible.

133
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,080
 And the first time, the first time in Scripture

134
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,080
 you read the word holy is right here.

135
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,000
 So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,400
 At the end of creating, God didn't build, make, inhabit

137
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,320
 a temple or a prayer mountain or a church or a cathedral.

138
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,720
 He made a day and he called it holy.

139
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:57,240
 I love this quote by Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel.

140
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,360
 He said this, "The Sabbaths are our great cathedrals."

141
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:11,380
 The Sabbath stands as an invitation

142
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,660
 from the creator to creation to work for six days

143
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,220
 just like God did and to rest for the seventh

144
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,180
 just like God did.

145
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:28,740
 When we don't do it, it can only lead

146
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,860
 to emotional unhealthiness, fatigue, lethargy,

147
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,660
 shutting down of our systems, feeling empty, disconnected.

148
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,860
 These are the results of life without Sabbath,

149
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,820
 which is why God goes on to command the Sabbath.

150
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:56,140
 If you could turn to Exodus 16,

151
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,900
 I'm gonna give you a picture.

152
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,740
 The Israelites are out in the desert.

153
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,100
 They're grumbling against God.

154
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,580
 They were anything but emotionally healthy.

155
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,620
 Let's read it.

156
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,380
 Then Moses said to Aaron,

157
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,260
 "Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel,

158
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,100
 "come near before the Lord for he has heard your grumbling."

159
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,140
 And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation

160
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,820
 of the people of Israel, they looked towards the wilderness

161
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,660
 and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.

162
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,500
 And the Lord said to Moses,

163
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,980
 "I've heard the grumbling of the people of Israel.

164
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,740
 "Say to them, at twilight, you shall eat meat.

165
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,420
 "And in the morning, you shall be filled with bread.

166
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,980
 "Then shall you know that I am the Lord your God."

167
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,020
 In the evening, quail come up, very nice, eh?

168
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,020
 You get it these days in Michelin star restaurants.

169
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,580
 In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp.

170
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,220
 And in the morning, dew lay around the camp.

171
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,220
 And when the dew had gone up,

172
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,660
 there was on the face of the wilderness,

173
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,660
 a fine flake like thing, fine as the frost on the ground.

174
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,340
 When the people of Israel saw it, they said to another,

175
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,460
 what is it?

176
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,180
 Now the word in Hebrew for what is it is actually manna.

177
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,500
 So it's where they turned to each other and said, manna.

178
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,780
 For they did not know what it was.

179
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,380
 And Moses said to them,

180
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,580
 "It is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat."

181
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,340
 Yes, the manna was the bread that God had given to eat.

182
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,020
 And then we read from verse 21.

183
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,300
 Morning by morning, they gathered it,

184
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,900
 ate as much as he could eat.

185
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:53,260
 And when the sun grew hot, it melted.

186
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,380
 On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread,

187
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,100
 two omens each.

188
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,500
 And when all the leaders of the congregation

189
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
 came and told Moses, he said to them,

190
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,700
 this is what the Lord commanded.

191
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,860
 Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest,

192
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,260
 a holy Sabbath to the Lord.

193
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:20,460
 Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest,

194
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,100
 a day of Sabbath to the Lord.

195
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,020
 Now notice these words.

196
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,620
 Sabbath and holy.

197
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:36,180
 Sabbath is 100% linked with worship.

198
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,340
 Sabbath is more than just a day off.

199
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:48,180
 The questions we should ask ourselves

200
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,300
 of our Sabbath are these.

201
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,780
 Do I rest?

202
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,700
 And do I worship?

203
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,860
 Let's look at the next verse.

204
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,580
 This is getting quite interesting.

205
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,180
 He said, "Bake what you will bake

206
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,980
 and boil what you will boil,

207
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,740
 and all that is left over,

208
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,860
 lay aside to be kept to the morning."

209
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,300
 Now what this speaks about is preparing for a Sabbath.

210
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,180
 And with it for us, a challenge

211
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,140
 to actually get ready to rest

212
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,660
 and to get ready for worship.

213
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,140
 The apostle John called it a preparation day.

214
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,340
 Let's read on.

215
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,340
 I'm enjoying this.

216
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,580
 So they laid it aside till morning

217
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,580
 as Moses commanded them,

218
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,380
 and it did not stink for there were no worms in it.

219
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,420
 Praise God for that.

220
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,020
 And Moses said, "Eat it today,

221
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,460
 for today is a Sabbath to the Lord.

222
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,900
 Today you will not find it in the field.

223
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,220
 Six days you shall gather it,

224
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,300
 but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath,

225
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,300
 there will be none."

226
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,620
 On the seventh day, some of the people,

227
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,780
 they didn't take notice.

228
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,740
 They went out to gather some, but they found none.

229
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,300
 And the Lord said to Moses,

230
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,620
 "How long?

231
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,700
 How long will you refuse to keep my commandments

232
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,060
 and my laws?

233
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,100
 See, the Lord has given you the Sabbath.

234
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,180
 Therefore, on the sixth day,

235
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,340
 he gives you bread for two days.

236
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,180
 Remain each of you in his place."

237
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,060
 Old Testament lockdown.

238
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,620
 Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.

239
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,700
 So the people rested on the seventh day.

240
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,580
 I wanna just highlight here this expression.

241
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,860
 And the Lord said to Moses,

242
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,540
 "How long will you refuse to keep my commandments

243
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,580
 and my laws?

244
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,980
 See, the Lord has given you the Sabbath."

245
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,260
 Yes, the Sabbath is a command,

246
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,700
 but it is also a gift.

247
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,060
 Now I know what you're thinking.

248
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,100
 Pastor John, that's the Old Testament.

249
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,780
 Yeah, I know it's in the 10 commandments

250
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,020
 in Exodus 20,

251
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,700
 but I don't read very much about the commandment

252
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,860
 to Sabbath in the New Testament.

253
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,900
 It is indeed one of the 10 commandments.

254
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,260
 Interestingly, the one that has the most words

255
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,420
 than the other nine.

256
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,820
 But you would be right.

257
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,780
 There is no command to Sabbath in the New Testament.

258
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,620
 Listen carefully.

259
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,620
 You don't have to Sabbath,

260
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:59,300
 but it still stands as a gift from God.

261
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,940
 Look, there's no commandment to sleep eight hours a night,

262
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,460
 but if you wanna be emotionally healthy,

263
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,300
 burning the candles at both ends

264
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,420
 will not lead to emotional health.

265
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,260
 The point I'm trying to make is this.

266
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,460
 The Sabbath is a gift from God.

267
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:22,540
 But as mankind, we have repeatedly spurned this gift

268
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,300
 over the past thousand years ago.

269
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,820
 We think we know best.

270
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,100
 We know how to work.

271
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,620
 We know how to play,

272
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,780
 but we do not know how to worship.

273
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,420
 We do not know how to Sabbath,

274
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:51,700
 even, or should I say, especially in the church.

275
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,900
 And the reason for this is partially down to a misread

276
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,940
 of something that Jesus said in his life.

277
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,140
 It's found in Mark chapter two.

278
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,100
 Now in the gospels, the Sabbath seems to be a day

279
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,980
 for Jesus to get himself into trouble.

280
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,860
 Just read the gospels.

281
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,660
 You can see this time and time again.

282
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,060
 There was a reason for this.

283
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,260
 Mark 2, 23, "One Sabbath,

284
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,140
 he was going through the grain fields.

285
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,460
 And as they made their way,

286
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,020
 his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.

287
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,740
 And the Pharisees were saying to him,

288
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,740
 'Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?'"

289
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,900
 You see what happened?

290
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,260
 The Pharisees had added so much to the law

291
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,060
 so that something that started out as good

292
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,860
 and the law was good,

293
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,740
 became a rod because of a hundreds of rules.

294
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,260
 The law had said, "You shall not work on the Sabbath."

295
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,820
 The Pharisees had taken it

296
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,500
 to mean you should not snack on a sweet corn.

297
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,820
 So Jesus replied, this verse is important.

298
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,940
 "And he said to him, 'The Sabbath was made for man,

299
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,940
 not man for the Sabbath.

300
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,940
 So the Son of Man is Lord, even of the Sabbath.'"

301
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,140
 This is an important verse.

302
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,140
 Jesus said, "Man wasn't created for the Sabbath."

303
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,980
 And the Pharisees needed to hear the second part of the verse.

304
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,180
 "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath."

305
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,380
 But we are not Pharisees.

306
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,780
 I hope.

307
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:44,180
 But as I look at that verse again, in the light of 2022,

308
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:52,020
 21st century society needs to hear clearly

309
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,740
 these words again.

310
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,580
 "The Sabbath was made for man."

311
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,820
 "The Sabbath was made for man."

312
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,140
 We have the opposite problem to the Pharisees.

313
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,180
 It's not that we have a hundreds of rules about the Sabbath,

314
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,020
 we have none.

315
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,460
 To be honest, most of us don't even take a Sabbath.

316
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,260
 Now let's read over the page into chapter three.

317
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,500
 And as I said earlier, Sabbath seemed to be the time

318
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,820
 for Jesus to get himself into trouble

319
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,220
 with the religious authorities.

320
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,460
 Look at this.

321
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,100
 Again, he entered the synagogue

322
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,940
 and a man was there with a withered hand.

323
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,860
 And they watched Jesus to see whether he would heal

324
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,140
 on the Sabbath so they might accuse him.

325
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,380
 And he said to the man with the withered hand, "Come here."

326
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:53,420
 And he said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath

327
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,420
 to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?"

328
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,300
 But they were silent.

329
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,060
 As he looked around at them with anger,

330
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,260
 grieved at their hardness of heart,

331
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,620
 he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."

332
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,780
 And his hand was restored.

333
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:24,220
 The Pharisees, true to form, went out

334
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,220
 and immediately held council with the Herodians against him,

335
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,220
 how to destroy him.

336
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,460
 Look again at the Gospels, read the Gospels.

337
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,580
 When do most of Jesus' healings take place?

338
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,140
 Yes, the Sabbath.

339
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,500
 Is that a coincidence?

340
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,340
 I don't think so.

341
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:54,460
 I believe that Jesus saw the Sabbath as a day for healing.

342
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:02,940
 We would do well to bear that in mind.

343
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,500
 Look, all I'm saying at this point is this.

344
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,460
 My friends, take a Sabbath.

345
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:16,580
 When, where, how, whatever works for you.

346
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:25,500
 But take a Sabbath.

347
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,220
 I'm gonna spend the rest of my time on a personal testimony.

348
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,260
 I said at the beginning,

349
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,700
 "I'm not there yet, this sermon is for me."

350
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,500
 And I certainly wasn't there 20 years ago.

351
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,300
 I was a general manager of an insurance company

352
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,060
 and helping to run a small but growing church

353
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,020
 as an elder and a preacher.

354
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,420
 Pretty flat out, I'm afraid.

355
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:55,420
 If I would say, "I'm busy," it was a reply,

356
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,020
 if you asked me how I was.

357
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,380
 Then I became a full-time pastor.

358
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,060
 This was my opportunity.

359
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,860
 Mondays became my Sabbaths.

360
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,540
 To be honest, I was often so worn out

361
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,380
 after ministering on Sundays.

362
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,660
 And I was really quite good.

363
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,540
 Mondays, I was uncontactable.

364
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,140
 I would even turn down lunches

365
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,460
 from famous speakers who'd come to Hong Kong

366
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,780
 'cause quite often they'd minister in Hong Kong

367
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,380
 on the weekend and then do a lunch on Monday.

368
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,940
 I still get calls from people who would say,

369
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:36,100
 "I know it's your day off, but."

370
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,180
 So I started first by muting the phone

371
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,020
 and then turning it off.

372
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:49,860
 I thought I was doing well

373
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,540
 until the 7th of June, 2019,

374
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,860
 the day that changed my life.

375
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:07,900
 I was in Israel in a place called Haifa

376
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,100
 as part of the team from KFCI.

377
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,020
 It was our first Friday, our first Shabbat.

378
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,740
 We knew things were gonna be slightly different

379
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,620
 when instead of pressing the button on the elevator,

380
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,900
 which apparently is classified as work,

381
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,180
 the elevator stops at every floor.

382
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:30,980
 The dining room at the Leonardo Plaza Hotel

383
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,180
 was set out differently that night.

384
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,700
 It was organised just for family groups

385
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,980
 and we were one of them.

386
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,860
 Then I met this wonderful guy in the picture.

387
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,700
 Sorry about my shirt, by the way. (laughs)

388
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,260
 He invited me to meet his family

389
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,460
 and they invited our group to join them

390
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,300
 and be part of their family for the Shabbat celebrations.

391
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,940
 Here he is with his son and part of our group.

392
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,340
 It's hard to describe the warmth, the love,

393
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:11,340
 the acceptance we received as we celebrated Shabbat together.

394
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,740
 We prayed blessings over each other

395
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,260
 and we took unleavened bread and wine together.

396
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:24,860
 We were so filled that when the family went,

397
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,820
 we took communion together, there's a picture here,

398
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,980
 to celebrate what we had experienced.

399
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,300
 And we did it again the following week,

400
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,700
 this time in Jerusalem.

401
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,740
 But what did I learn from Israel?

402
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,340
 It seemed to me a little bit like what we experience here

403
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,140
 with families during Chinese New Year, but every week.

404
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:51,020
 It's like doing Chinese New Year every Friday.

405
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:57,140
 I learned in Haifa that my Mondays, good as they were,

406
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:02,980
 had in reality been a day off rather than a Sabbath.

407
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:11,940
 I learned in Haifa that Sabbath was more than a day off.

408
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:18,500
 I found out in Haifa four elements

409
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,180
 that go up to making a Sabbath, Sabbath.

410
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,980
 I've put them on the screen.

411
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,940
 Sabbath equals stopping and resting

412
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,460
 and delighting and worship.

413
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,620
 I'll say that again, this is important.

414
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,620
 Sabbath is stopping and resting and delighting and worship.

415
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:53,300
 As I finish, may I just look briefly at each one.

416
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,380
 Firstly, stopping.

417
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,540
 We're invited to stop working,

418
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,700
 to stop thinking about working,

419
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,100
 to stop worrying, to stop wanting.

420
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,900
 The act of stopping means we trust in God.

421
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,940
 Resting, we're invited to both physical

422
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,700
 and emotional rest on the Sabbath.

423
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,540
 On this day, we release the illusion of control to God

424
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,860
 and know that he will keep us

425
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,740
 in the midst of the unfinished work.

426
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,100
 Rather like those Israels with the bread.

427
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:43,580
 Delighting, we are invited to a kind of resting

428
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,620
 that is a feast, a party and our celebration.

429
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:52,620
 Sabbath is all about creating space for delight.

430
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,780
 John Mark Comer says,

431
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,700
 "Sabbath is a day to feed our soul with beauty,

432
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,580
 "to rewire the pathways of our brain,

433
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:04,140
 "to rejoice in the Lord always."

434
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,780
 And lastly, worshipping.

435
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,460
 When we stop to rest and delight,

436
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,100
 it leads us to worship God.

437
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,580
 We find ourselves thanking God.

438
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,940
 Sabbath gives us a chance to be human again,

439
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,260
 to get our souls back again,

440
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,460
 to become emotionally healthy.

441
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,180
 I've no idea what it looks like for you.

442
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,460
 What constitutes rest and worship for you

443
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,020
 may be very different for what constitutes rest

444
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,340
 and worship for me.

445
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:52,060
 But what I do want to do is to encourage you to Sabbath.

446
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:56,620
 Reshape your life from top to bottom.

447
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:02,660
 And together, we can reshape our church

448
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,180
 and indeed our city.

449
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,900
 It is a pathway to emotional health,

450
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,700
 a pathway to life in God's present,

451
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,580
 a relief from busy, busy, busy, busy.

452
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:22,540
 And at the same time, discover life.

453
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,580
 Discover a God who made the universe

454
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,900
 as a place to be with these people

455
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,460
 and a place for us to be without God.

456
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,500
 As Brother Lawrence says,

457
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,220
 to practise the presence of God.

458
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:41,300
 Walter Brueggemann, widely considered

459
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,100
 one of the most influential scholars

460
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,500
 of the last several decades said this,

461
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,460
 "People who keep Sabbath live all seven days differently."

462
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,060
 Can I say it again?

463
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:02,260
 People who keep Sabbath live all seven days differently.

464
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:13,140
 My friend, it is not just 24 hours at the end of a week.

465
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,220
 It is a way of life.

466
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:23,980
 It is a way to live in God's presence all week long.

467
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:30,180
 When we Sabbath well, we stay in that spirit all week long.

468
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,620
 Even as we work, as we labour, we toil, we contend.

469
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:40,220
 That is what I want for you.

470
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,780
 My church family, my friends.

471
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:51,660
 Make a decision today

472
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,020
 to make this part of your life.

473
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:04,700
 My friends, there is a day that is blessed and holy.

474
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:08,940
 There is rhythm in your body and soul.

475
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,540
 There's rhythm in the universe.

476
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,300
 They're into place, work and rest.

477
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,940
 Maybe you are being called today, I know I am,

478
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:23,620
 to slow your life down,

479
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,140
 to tune into that rhythm.

480
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:32,100
 Maybe you have to change your lifestyle.

481
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,900
 I have a word of comfort for you.

482
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:43,860
 God is waiting for you there.

483
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,100
 I'm gonna ask James to come back

484
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,900
 and we're gonna sing a rather special song.

485
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,660
 We're gonna sing this song, Still.

486
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,660
 I wanna invite you wherever you are,

487
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,340
 if you're a computer at home

488
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,620
 and you're looking on the other screen

489
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,340
 or you're checking emails or sports results or anything,

490
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,660
 to put down everything you're doing.

491
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:13,900
 I'm gonna pray and we're gonna sing that song together.

492
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:20,020
 I will be still and know that you are God.

493
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,100
 You are God.

494
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,540
 That's our prayer as a church, surely,

495
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:33,380
 that we will be still and know that he is God.

496
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,500
 Let's pray.

497
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:41,260
 Father, I pray that you would calm the raging storm.

498
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:49,500
 Lord, when we read the newspaper headlines daily,

499
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,460
 there's so much going on in our world, in our city.

500
00:32:53,460 --> 00:33:01,260
 I pray you'll give us time now just to focus on you.

501
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,620
 And Lord, that your spirit would speak to our spirit

502
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,660
 about the changes we need to make in our lives,

503
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,540
 in our church, in our city,

504
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:17,020
 to learn to do Sabbath.

505
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,860
 We thank you, Lord, you have a plan

506
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,300
 and a purpose for each one of us.

507
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,380
 You have a plan and a purpose for this church.

508
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,380
 Your hand is upon Hong Kong.

509
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,980
 Use this time tonight

510
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:40,020
 where the storms of life are raging

511
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:45,140
 to give us that peace in our heart tonight.

512
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,540
 In Jesus' name we pray.

513
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,040
 (piano music)
