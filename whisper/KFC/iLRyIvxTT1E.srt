1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Today we are going to talk about the fourth chapter.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 This picture is about a tree, or a plant, if you remember.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 I thought of a famous V-Thot, but I was afraid that people would complain if I uploaded it.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 So I will use a German word.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I heard the pronunciation, but I might have read it wrong.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 It's Schadenfreude.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 I will sing it again.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Schadenfreude.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Let's give Gabriel a round of applause.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Schadenfreude.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 You might have guessed the meaning of this word if you watched the video.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Let me show you what it means.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I think Gabriel might know, but let me show you.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 The hint is that it is in the Oxford Dictionary.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 But it is a combination of two German words.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Schadenfreude.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 I checked it online, so I might be wrong.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Schaden means damage.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And Freude means joy.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Can you guess what this word means?

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 The first one is damage, and the second one is joy.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Joy over damage.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Joy over damage.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Yes, that's the German composition.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 What is this word?

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 I chose this one.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 If I know the Chinese name, I will use the Chinese idiom "幸"

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
幸在樂和

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 I know there is a more common phrase in Hong Kong.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 It means "I am happy to see others being embarrassed."

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I won't post this one.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I thought about it for a long time, but I was afraid that people would complain.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 But you don't need to tell me what you know.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I read this when I was preparing for this talk.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 This is a common phrase in psychology.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 We don't want people to die or get hurt.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 But even if your friend is hurt,

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 you might think it's funny.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 This is a common phrase in psychology.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Why did I choose this word?

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Because the context is the same.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 The fourth chapter is the same.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Why did I choose this word?

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 The fourth chapter is a summary of the story.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 In the first chapter,

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 John is very unhappy and angry.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 I want to make sure that you know the progress.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 What does this mean?

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 What does "it" mean?

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I think someone is thinking.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I will not say it.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Thank you for answering.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 The third chapter talks about "repentance."

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Do you think that a normal repentance should be...

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Let's say you have a friend.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 What would you do when you believe in Jesus?

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Let's say you don't have any regrets.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Does anyone think it's bad to believe in Jesus?

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 No? Okay. That's good.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 I think in a normal situation,

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 even if I'm not very close to my friend,

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 let's say you're sitting here.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 You're not home to sleep.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Let's say you think that believing in Jesus is useful

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 or a good thing.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 When you believe in Jesus,

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 even if you're not very close to your friend,

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 you will still be very...

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Not only will you be partying.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 In the New Testament, Jesus gives an analogy.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 If there is a man on the earth who is saved,

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 then there are angels in heaven who will bless him.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 This is probably...

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Even if we haven't reached that level,

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 I still think it's a good thing.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 But do you remember what John's reaction was?

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Why did I forget so quickly?

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Yes, he was angry.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Angry about what?

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Why was he angry about the ashes?

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 This is a bit further.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 We explained a little bit about this in the past few weeks.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Of course, we are a very bad person.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 A person who hurts others.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 I don't know if you've been bullied in school.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I hope you haven't.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 But if you have, then...

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Okay.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Imagine someone who hurts you believes in Jesus.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 What would your reaction be?

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Someone who hurts you says he believes in Jesus.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 What would your reaction be?

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 What would your reaction be?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Sorry?

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Oh, you love that guy.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Okay, that's a positive.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 I appreciate a positive response.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 But it's obvious that Vietnam doesn't respond like this.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Vietnam is angry.

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Why is he angry?

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 There's a saying in the back.

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 What is he angry about?

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 What did he say?

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 He said, "I know God is gracious and merciful.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 He has a generous love, and is not easily angry.

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 He has a great desire to repent and is not easily discouraged.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 So he ran away."

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 You might think,

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 "We came back today,

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 and I know God is such a good God.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 So I should respond to him."

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 But Vietnam said, "I have to run away.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I have to run away."

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 If you remember chapter 1,

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 it was a few weeks ago.

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 You might not remember.

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 In chapter 1,

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 he had to take a boat to the west.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 We don't really know what happened at the beginning.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 If you look at the first chapter of the book of John,

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 it's just that John said to John,

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 "You have to go there."

124
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 But in the book of Kings,

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 he went straight to the other side.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 So the whole crime scene,

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 until this moment,

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 is what the reason is.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 What is it?

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 "So John knew God was gracious and merciful.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 He has a generous love,

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 and is not easily angry.

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 He has a great desire to repent and is not easily discouraged.

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 Normally, your response is,

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 "That's good. I think it's good."

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 But John was angry.

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 John thought these people were not worthy.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It was not worth it for God to love him like that.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 There will be an action later

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 that shows that he thought that way.

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 But if we look at the last chapter,

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 we find that John knew.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 John knew what God was.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 But he chose not to follow.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Why do I say he knew?

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Because if we look at the last chapter,

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 let's say you listened to it last week.

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Let's say you listened to it.

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 Did John know what God was?

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Did he know?

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 Someone said they knew.

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 You said you knew.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Let's zoom in.

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 You said you knew.

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 Did John know what God was?

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 He didn't know.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Maybe he thought it was good.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 But if we look at the third chapter,

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 the ninth chapter,

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 what did John say?

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 He said, "Who knows?"

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 Everyone's English is better than mine.

163
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 "Who knows?"

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 "Who knows" is "知" or "唔知"?

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 He didn't know.

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 When they kneeled down,

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 they didn't know.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 They were afraid of dying.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 But John knew.

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 John knew what God was.

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Let's read it again.

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 "God who has grace and mercy,

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 who does not easily go astray,

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 who has a loving and loving heart,

175
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 and who never regrets what he says."

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 But you find that the "who knows"

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 is a very proper response.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 When we say we believe in Jesus,

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 we have to repent.

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 So a person who doesn't know God

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 has a very proper response.

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 They repent and say,

183
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 "Maybe God will regret and not go astray."

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 You see I'm highlighting this.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 The author is clearly making a parallel.

186
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 John knew what happened.

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 But because he knew,

188
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 he had to go astray.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 So if you look at it from this perspective,

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 even John's prayer...

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 We can learn a lot from John's prayer.

192
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I can learn a lot from the content of his prayer.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 It's not that the prayer itself is a bad thing.

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 But if we look at it from this perspective,

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 even if the second chapter is a good prayer,

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 a prayer that gives us a lot of reflection,

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 it also says that I am right.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 I am right in following you.

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 I know you.

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Those people don't know you, but I know you.

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 I know you will save me.

202
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 The "who knows" is very proper.

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 In today's terms,

204
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 the "who knows" is very proper.

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 But you see the response.

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 He is even worse than a little king who doesn't know God.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 Who knows?

208
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 He knows, but he chooses not to follow.

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 So why did Vietnam refuse to go?

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 They were so unworthy of death.

211
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 The reason is that only this chapter is seen.

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 If we didn't have previous accounts or see the crime scene,

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 we would have only realized that

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 they really wanted to see people die.

215
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 They were happy to see people die.

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 It's not just about falling.

217
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 What he is saying is that people died.

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 If you remember what he said in the third chapter,

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 if you go to the fourth chapter, your city will collapse.

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Your people will all die.

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 He said it to this extent.

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 So the real problem with Vietnam

223
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 is not that he doesn't know God.

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 The real problem with Vietnam is that he doesn't accept,

225
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 he is not willing for God to use his

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 dislike and not-expecting way to do things.

227
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 What does that mean?

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 God sometimes gives you some humiliation,

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 or gives you something you don't want.

230
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 You think you don't want it at that moment.

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 You think, "What's wrong with that?"

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 "You said you would give me something good."

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 I believe, not just me,

234
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 I believe everyone has a lot of experiences like this.

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Why don't you give me a good half?

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Why do you give me a breakup?

237
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 Of course, if God is willing to give you another half,

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 you will be very happy.

239
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 But a lot of people can't find it.

240
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 So he asks, "Why don't you give me one?"

241
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 "I know you are this kind of God. Why don't you give me one?"

242
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Luckily, this is what happened to Joanna.

243
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 If God is really this bad,

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 what would Joanna do?

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 She would just use a thunderbolt to kill him.

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And that would be the end of the story.

247
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 But that's not what happened.

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 We are very grateful that God is a God with compassion.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 So what?

250
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 God wants him to know him more.

251
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 How does he know him?

252
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Through an action.

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Let me ask you.

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 This is the first four chapters.

255
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 When Joanna complained to God,

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 God knew she was this good, so he didn't follow her.

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 God knew she wouldn't punish them.

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 God asked her, "Is this right?"

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 She said, "No."

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 But do you think Joanna would not be angry?

261
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 What would she do?

262
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 She would continue to be angry.

263
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 What does the Bible say?

264
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Some people are looking for the Bible.

265
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 What does the Bible say?

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 What did she do next?

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Sorry?

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 She would rather die, but she did one thing.

269
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 She didn't leave this time.

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 In the first chapter, she left after hearing God's words.

271
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 She didn't leave this time.

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 She didn't leave to take a boat.

273
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 What did she do?

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 I forgot the script.

275
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 I don't know this part.

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 What did she do?

277
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 She went to the other side of the city.

278
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 She sat down.

279
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 What do you think she was doing?

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 She didn't wait.

281
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Let's look at the IG.

282
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 I appreciate the answer.

283
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 What was she doing?

284
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 She was sitting there.

285
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 What happened?

286
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 She was sitting there, waiting for her death.

287
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 The Bible didn't say that.

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 It said, "Let's see what happens in the city."

289
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 But if we read this, we know she was waiting for her death.

290
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 It's actually very contradictory.

291
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 You ask her,

292
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 she knows very well what God is like.

293
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 So God said that,

294
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 and she didn't do it.

295
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 She knew it was over.

296
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 She didn't have a choice.

297
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 She sat there, waiting for her death.

298
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 But she still had to wait.

299
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 So she was angry.

300
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 I agree that she was angry.

301
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 But at least she made some progress.

302
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 She didn't just leave.

303
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 She didn't just leave and ignore it.

304
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 She had to see it.

305
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Let's think about this.

306
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 She was a prophet.

307
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Even if we're not prophets,

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 we feel that if someone believes in Jesus,

309
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 we should be happy.

310
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 It's normal to feel happy when your friend is in heaven.

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Don't believe in Jesus.

312
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 But she brought a whole city of people.

313
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 It's not that she believed in God.

314
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 But at least a whole city of people repented.

315
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 She was really something.

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 But she was still angry.

317
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 She didn't like it.

318
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 But God didn't let her go.

319
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 She was clearly sitting there,

320
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 waiting for her death.

321
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 But God didn't punish her directly.

322
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 What did God do?

323
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 The Bible says that God gave her a plant.

324
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 I'm not familiar with plants.

325
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 I've never seen one.

326
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Anyway, it's a plant.

327
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 This plant is taller than the heat.

328
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 What does that mean?

329
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 It's a bit of geographical knowledge.

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 For example,

331
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 the location of Iran today.

332
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 You know, those places are not like...

333
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 There are not many trees.

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 It's not a rainforest.

335
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 In fact, the central area is full of deserts.

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 There are a lot of mines.

337
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 If you remember, the mine area...

338
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 The Israelis have been walking for 40 years.

339
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 So those places have no responsibility.

340
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 If you sit across from them,

341
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 you'll be dead if you sit there and look.

342
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 God gave her a plant.

343
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 It's taller than her head.

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 It covers her.

345
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Although we've seen this sentence before,

346
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 this sentence has a little trick.

347
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 The Bible says that this tree delivers her.

348
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 It makes her less suffering.

349
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 It helps her get out of the suffering.

350
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 To put it simply,

351
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 there are many words for suffering.

352
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 In English, you can say pain,

353
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 discomfort,

354
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 or suffering.

355
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 But in the author's dictionary,

356
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 he deliberately uses the phrase

357
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 to refer to the sin of God saving the Lilliputians.

358
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 The Lilliputians are sinners.

359
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 The first chapter says they are sinners.

360
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 It's the same word.

361
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 What does it mean?

362
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 God saved the Lilliputians from their sin.

363
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 At least, that's what it means.

364
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Although Vietnam didn't save them.

365
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 If you don't repent, you'll be dead.

366
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 But God saved the Lilliputians

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 from their sin.

368
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 It's the same word.

369
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 God saved the Lilliputians

370
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 from their discomfort.

371
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 At least, they don't have to be burned.

372
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 It's the same word.

373
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Of course, it's not that Vietnam is evil.

374
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 That's not what it means.

375
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 But there's a clear balance here.

376
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 God saved the Lilliputians

377
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 from their suffering.

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 He's willing to save those

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 who seem like bad people.

380
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 He's willing to save those

381
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 who seem like bad people

382
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 from their sin.

383
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Sin can make us suffer.

384
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 We believe in that.

385
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 If the story stops here,

386
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 it's a happy ending.

387
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 If the sin stops here, it's a happy ending.

388
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 But does anyone remember

389
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 what happened next?

390
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 The tree is here.

391
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Was it dead or what?

392
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 It wasn't dead.

393
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 It was dead.

394
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 It was called dead and dried up.

395
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 The tree was dead.

396
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 It was a tree that was dead.

397
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 You have a script.

398
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Some people have a script.

399
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 I don't remember.

400
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 What does the sin say?

401
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 God turned the tree into a tree.

402
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 The tree was forced to grow.

403
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 It's obvious that it wasn't planted.

404
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 It was God who let it grow.

405
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 What did God do the next day?

406
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 He bit the tree with a worm.

407
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 He bit it until it was dry.

408
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Not only that,

409
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 God also told him to make the place

410
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 (the wilderness)

411
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 to be sun-dried.

412
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 What did the devil do?

413
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 He planted a tree.

414
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 He should be angry

415
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 because he's planting a tree.

416
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 He said, "I'm going to die."

417
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 He's throwing a tantrum.

418
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 He's always throwing a tantrum.

419
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 He's throwing a tantrum since the first chapter.

420
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 So what did the devil do?

421
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 God asked him,

422
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 "Why are you angry?

423
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Are you angry at the tree?"

424
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 He's not angry at God.

425
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 He's angry at the tree.

426
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 What did the devil say?

427
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 He said, "I'm angry to death.

428
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 It's reasonable.

429
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 I deserve it."

430
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 I should be able to change my mind.

431
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 I deserve it.

432
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 When you ask him if he knows

433
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 the tree was given to him by God,

434
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 he might know.

435
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 He did something for God.

436
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 He should have this.

437
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 He deserves this treatment.

438
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 So God gave him a final lesson.

439
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 In this book,

440
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 we call it an open ending.

441
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Because at this point,

442
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 after God gave the final lesson,

443
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 we don't know the answer.

444
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 What lesson did he give?

445
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 What did God say?

446
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 God said, "This plant is not for you to plant.

447
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 It's not for you to nurture."

448
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 It's not for you to nurture.

449
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 It's not for you to grow up.

450
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 It's not for you to grow up.

451
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 It's not for you to die.

452
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 It's for you to love.

453
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 It's compassion.

454
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 It's for you to love.

455
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 In the 11th chapter,

456
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 "However, you are not yet mature.

457
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 You cannot tell the difference

458
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 between the left and the right hand.

459
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 There are more than 120,000 people

460
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 and many of them are new.

461
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 How can I not love?"

462
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 You will find that the 10th and 11th chapters

463
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 are all about this.

464
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Let's talk about the first thing

465
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 that is easy to understand.

466
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 John clearly knew

467
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 what kind of God he was.

468
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 He memorized it correctly.

469
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 In today's terms,

470
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 he graduated from the Academy of God

471
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 with full marks.

472
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 He memorized the verses of the Gospel,

473
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 "There is compassion, there is love,

474
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 there is not easy way, there is a way."

475
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 He had a good theology.

476
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 He had a good theology.

477
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 It doesn't mean that he did a good thing.

478
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 His problem was that

479
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 he found that God's work

480
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 was in contradiction with what he wanted.

481
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Of course, we can see that

482
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 this is a translation that

483
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 is most commonly adopted.

484
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It's like asking him

485
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 if he was willing to love people

486
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 just for himself.

487
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 I will talk about

488
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 how to understand this in the following section.

489
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 I said earlier that John had a good theology.

490
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 John's problem was not

491
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 that he didn't know what God was like.

492
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 He knew.

493
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 You could say that he had full marks

494
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 for knowing things.

495
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 But knowing doesn't mean that

496
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 he was willing to accept

497
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 what God said.

498
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 He didn't like it.

499
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 He didn't know that what God said was true.

500
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 Of course, we need to emphasize that

501
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 God didn't just love.

502
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 If we just stop here,

503
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 we will think that God loves everyone.

504
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 But if we remember from the Bible,

505
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Pastor Karen mentioned this

506
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 in his first sermon.

507
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 People are always bad.

508
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 So God did judge in the end.

509
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Today, we are not reading the book of Nahuels.

510
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 You can go back and read it yourself.

511
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 In the end, God still

512
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 judged this.

513
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 God still has punishment.

514
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Of course, you can say that

515
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 God repented.

516
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 But you can also imagine that

517
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 after someone repents, they will commit a crime again.

518
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Or, after they repent, they deliberately commit a crime again.

519
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 Today, when we believe in Jesus,

520
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 we will sometimes fall, sometimes get up.

521
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 But if they repent,

522
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 they deliberately do it,

523
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 I don't believe it. I don't like it.

524
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 So God still judged in the end.

525
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 So, apart from the question I asked,

526
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 if we look at the structure of culture,

527
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 to put it simply,

528
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 it can be changed to another meaning,

529
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 which is that I will not love this God anymore.

530
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 Of course,

531
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 does that mean it's different? No.

532
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Actually, the application is still the same.

533
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 John's theology is not wrong.

534
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 It's not that he doesn't recognize this God.

535
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 It's that he recognizes

536
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 his mistake.

537
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 But he doesn't like

538
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 this God to do this.

539
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 He doesn't like God

540
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 to use his time to work.

541
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 After this, you can choose to use the first question.

542
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 Because there are indeed many

543
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 traditions or many scholars believe that.

544
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 I put two questions here.

545
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 But I think both are the same application.

546
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 We can be very familiar with this God.

547
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 But at the end of the day,

548
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 we don't like

549
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 to do His things

550
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 in His time.

551
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 As I said, John

552
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 is a person who values

553
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 his freedom.

554
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I think this is especially true

555
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 for our society today.

556
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 We value our freedom.

557
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 I think it's not just an iPhone.

558
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Actually, iPhone is also an "I".

559
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 We have a lot of things

560
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 that we want to show ourselves.

561
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 So even if I come back to church

562
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 and recognize this God,

563
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 what definition do I use for myself?

564
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 For example, I am a pastor.

565
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 I am a pastor.

566
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I am a leader.

567
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 I am a junior.

568
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I don't have many services.

569
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 But as we grow up,

570
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 we will define ourselves.

571
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 We will slowly realize

572
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 that God is like this.

573
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 We can memorize it.

574
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 I remember when I taught

575
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 Avana two weeks ago,

576
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 I was very impressed by

577
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 a very short boy in the class.

578
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 Don't ask me who he is.

579
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 But,

580
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 it was a Bible Q&A competition.

581
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 He was the most suitable one.

582
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 He was the most suitable one.

583
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 He even mentioned the names.

584
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 I intentionally gave him some difficult ones.

585
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Because the questions were too simple.

586
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 He answered them well.

587
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 Then I asked him directly,

588
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 "You know so many Bibles,

589
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 but do you believe in Jesus?"

590
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 He told me,

591
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 "Actually, I don't know if I believe in Jesus."

592
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 He knew all the stories

593
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 in the Bible.

594
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 All the characters in the Bible.

595
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 But he said, "Actually, I am not sure if I believe in Jesus."

596
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 I hope I am not talking about you.

597
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Sometimes, we don't like God

598
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 using a method we don't expect.

599
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 We like God's timing.

600
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 God's timing is good, we can say.

601
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 But, after we have said all these,

602
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 we still feel uncomfortable.

603
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 It is normal to feel uncomfortable.

604
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 It is okay to struggle with God.

605
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 But if I don't like what you are doing,

606
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 I will not follow you.

607
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 This is the problem.

608
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 Faith is not an intellectual exercise.

609
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 If I can think it through,

610
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 I will believe in Jesus.

611
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 Just like Jonah, he could think through

612
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 what God was.

613
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 But an intellectual exercise

614
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 will not help us

615
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 understand God.

616
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 God wants us to have a personal relationship.

617
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 He wants us to renew our relationship.

618
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 He wants us to stop at what we like,

619
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 what we are obsessed with.

620
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 Maybe that is my emotion.

621
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 Maybe some people are touched by the song.

622
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Maybe some people like to make

623
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 philosophical arguments, and are happy.

624
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Some people like to insist on the theory,

625
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 and are happy.

626
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 But in the end, God does not want us

627
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 to stick to these things.

628
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 God wants us to really know Him.

629
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 I invite the team to sing

630
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 "Reconciliation" with us.

631
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 "Reconciliation" has two lines.

632
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 The first line is about us.

633
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 Today is the Pentecost.

634
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 I think many of us have parents

635
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 who grew up in this church.

636
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Some of them believe in Jesus.

637
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 We are probably second generation Christians.

638
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Maybe we have a lot of traditions

639
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 in our childhood.

640
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 We have our religion.

641
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 This is really a religion,

642
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 but in the eyes of others.

643
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 But as the conclusion says,

644
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 God never expects us to be weak.

645
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 God really wants us to know Him.

646
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 He wants us to have compassion

647
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 not only for ourselves,

648
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 but also for others,

649
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 like God does.

650
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I invite the team to sing "Reconciliation"

651
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 with us.

652
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 I invite the team to sing "Reconciliation" with us.

653
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

654
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:48,920
