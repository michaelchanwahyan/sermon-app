1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Now let's pass the time to Pastor James for scripture reading.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Isaiah 58, true and false fasting.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Cry aloud, do not hold back.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Lift up your voice like a trumpet and declare to my people their transgression.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 To the house of Jacob their sins.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 as if they were a nation that did righteousness

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 and did not forsake the judgment of their God.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 They ask of me righteous judgments, they delight to draw near to God.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Why have we fasted and you see it not?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Why have we humbled ourselves and you take no knowledge of it?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Behold, in the day of your fast you seek your own pleasure

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 and oppress all your workers.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Behold, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to hit with a wicked fist.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Fasting like yours this day will not make your voice to be heard on high.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Is it such the fast that I choose, a day for a person to humble himself?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Is it to bow down his head like a reed and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Will you call this a fast and a day acceptable to the Lord?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Is not this the fast that I choose, to loose the bonds of wickedness,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 to undo the straps of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free and to break every yoke?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless pouring to your house?

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 When you see the naked, to cover him and not to hide yourself from your own flesh,

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 then shall your light break forth like the dawn and your healing shall spring up speedily.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Your righteousness shall go before you.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 The glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Then you shall call and the Lord will answer.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 You shall cry and he will say, 'Here I am.'

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 If you take away the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness,

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 if you pour yourself out for the hungry and satisfy the desire of the afflicted,

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 then shall your light rise in the darkness and your gloom be as the noonday.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And the Lord will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scattered places

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 and make your bones strong.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And your ancient ruins shall be rebuilt.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 You shall raise up the foundations of many generations.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 You shall be called the repairer of the breach, the restorer of streets to dwell in.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 This is the word of the Lord.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And now I'd like to pass the time over to Pastor John to give us the word.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Hi Church. I'm so excited about what God is doing in our church and in our city.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 The combined service last week really touched my heart.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And I know for many of you too.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And Johnny's already told us that the Church of Hong Kong is going to join together as one

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 to fast for our city.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 We fast for two reasons.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 One, we love Hong Kong.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And secondly, we love God.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 And it is so good that we as Gong Fuk Church are joining together.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Three congregations, English, Cantonese and Mandarin,

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 to do a devotional together and to pray together on the day of Pentecost.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I remember very few church sermons on fasting.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 In some quarters, fasting has been tarred with a brush of legalism.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Maybe a reaction to abuses over the centuries.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 But I believe that that has caused the church to forfeit an intimacy with God

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 that is rightfully ours.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 So let's put that right.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Following the combined service, I believe this church and the Church of Hong Kong

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 is preparing the ground to step into a new season.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 I know I say this every week, but I for one am excited.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Now, since Jesus is our role model, let's look at the first works of Jesus

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 in Luke chapter 4.

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 I start from verse 1.

62
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert,

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 where for forty days he was tempted by the devil.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 He ate nothing during those days, and at the end of them he was hungry.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Jesus was hungry.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Note, not thirsty.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 Therefore, it's safe to conclude that for forty days he only drank water.

68
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Now note, he was full of the Holy Spirit.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit before being driven into the wilderness.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And we know the story.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 He withstood Satan's temptations.

72
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 But how could he do it?

73
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Forty days, just drinking water.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Luke 4.14 will let you into the secret.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Luke tells us Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit.

76
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Now note the difference.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Verse 1, Jesus was led by the Holy Spirit.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Verse 14, after forty days of fasting, where he defeated Satan,

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 he was operating in the power of the Holy Spirit.

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 I believe this is very important to us as we approach the Feast of Pentecost.

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Church, there is a clear difference between being filled with the Holy Spirit

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 and operating in the power of the Holy Spirit.

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Something transformed Jesus from being a spirit-filled man

84
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 to a man walking in the power of the Spirit.

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 What about us?

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 For us, being filled with the Spirit does not mean that we are ready to move

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 in the fullness of our calling or power in God.

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 We need to submit to the discipline of the Holy Spirit.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 During that time, God will disciple us in prayer, in fasting,

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 in skillful use of his Word.

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 The result is this, we are released in the power of the Holy Spirit to do his will.

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Fasting is, we believe, an important key to go beyond the infilling of the Spirit

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 to tap the power of the Spirit for us and for our church.

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 The aim of this sermon is that we all clearly see that fasting

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 helps release the power of God in our lives.

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Now let's be careful.

97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 Fasting does not earn any more of the grace of God.

98
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 But we contend it does facilitate the flowing of the Spirit

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 through the dissolving, the removing of the junk in our lives.

100
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Fasting is one of the most misunderstood subjects in the whole Bible.

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And that's sad, as the Bible tells us of the incredible benefits.

102
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Fasting is mentioned more than 50 times in the Bible.

103
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 Isaiah chapter 58, which James just read, is a chapter on fasting.

104
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 We suggest you read that chapter and meditate on it.

105
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Now the background is Isaiah is warning the Israelites, don't abuse fasting.

106
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 He says, "You said, 'Why have we fasted?' they said, 'and you've not seen it.

107
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 Why have you humbled ourselves and you haven't noticed?'"

108
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And they say, "God, I've been fasting. Weren't you watching?"

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 God says on the day of your fasting, you do as you please.

110
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 You exploit all your workers.

111
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Your fasting ends in quarrelling and strife and in striking each other with wicked feasts.

112
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 You cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high.

113
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Strong words.

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 God then lists 12 blessings of the fast I have chosen.

115
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 I repeat, I invite you to read Isaiah 58.

116
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 We will be doing so as a church during our devotional.

117
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 It talks about revelation, healing and wholeness, righteousness, the presence of God, answered prayer,

118
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 continued guidance, contentment, strength, refreshing like a spring, work that endures,

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 raising up of the future generations and restorations.

120
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 I like that.

121
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 But what I want to focus on this evening is the question, "Why?"

122
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 Why do we fast?

123
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I'm going to give you 9 good reasons to fast.

124
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Firstly, we fast in obedience to God's word.

125
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Fasting is deeply ingrained in God's word.

126
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 It's mentioned 56 times, both in the Old Testament and the New Testament.

127
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 It is a tool of successful leaders.

128
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Samuel 2.12 says, "Even now, declares the Lord, return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning."

129
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 And there are many other biblical references.

130
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Secondly, we fast to humble ourselves before God and to obtain His grace and His power.

131
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 James 4.10 says, "Humble yourself before the Lord and He will lift you up."

132
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 Fasting is humbling yourself before God to overcome temptations in areas that stop us moving into God's power.

133
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Jesus did it in the wilderness.

134
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 So can we.

135
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Thirdly, we fast to overcome temptations in areas that stop us moving into God's power.

136
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Do you have these?

137
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 I do.

138
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Is there anyone here who doesn't?

139
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 What are your barriers?

140
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Let's go back to Luke 4.

141
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 Jesus in the wilderness, tempted by the devil.

142
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 What did He do? Fast.

143
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 The result? He came out in the power of the Holy Spirit.

144
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 He whipped the devil and came forth in power.

145
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 So can we.

146
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 We fast to become unentangled from sin and to help others to do so.

147
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Jesus took away all the sins of the world at Calvary.

148
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Yet many of us have to deal with entangling sins that pop up time and time again.

149
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Church, God not only wants to defeat those in our lives, but He wants us to stand in the gap as intercessors for others.

150
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 If there is a habit or a chronic sin, He wants us to take on the sin of others.

151
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 You remember Daniel chapter 9.

152
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with Him in prayer and petition, in fasting and in sackcloth and ashes.

153
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed.

154
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Oh Lord, the great and awesome God who keeps His covenant of love with all who love Him and obey His commands.

155
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 We have sinned and done wrong.

156
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 We have been wicked and have rebelled.

157
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 We have turned away from Your commands and laws.

158
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Remember the man that prayed this prayer, Daniel, was described as the most righteous man in his generation.

159
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Number 5, we feast to become weak so that God can become strong.

160
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 By fasting you make a conscious decision and a choice that we demonstrate.

161
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 By an outward act that you want God's power to flow through you and not your own power.

162
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 You want God's answer, not yours.

163
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 That's why God said to Paul, "My power is made perfect in your weakness."

164
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 See what David says in the Psalms.

165
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Psalm 109, "My knees give way from fasting, my body is thin and gaunt."

166
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Not a good advertisement for fasting.

167
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 "I am the object of scorn from my accusers.

168
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 When they see me they shake their heads.

169
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Help me, oh Lord, my God.

170
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Save me in accordance with Your love.

171
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Let them know that it is Your hand that You, oh Lord, have done it."

172
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 Number 6, we fast to attain God's support in order to accomplish His will.

173
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 In the book of Acts, chapter 13, we read, "So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off.

174
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Then two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia and sailed from there to Cyprus."

175
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And in the next chapter, chapter 14, Paul and Barnabas appointed elders for them in each church.

176
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 And with prayer and fasting, committed them to the Lord in whom they had put their trust.

177
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 I find it fascinating that the leaders of Antioch fasted and prayed before they sent out Paul and Barnabas.

178
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Why?

179
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 So leaders would make the right choice and the success of the mission.

180
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 In the next chapter, we read Paul and Barnabas following the same pattern.

181
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 We should do the same before major decisions and get God on our side.

182
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Number 7, we fast in times of crisis.

183
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I don't need to tell you. This is Hong Kong. This is the world.

184
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 In 2020, we are in a time of crisis.

185
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Man has always turned to God in times of crisis.

186
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Take the book of Esther, which we will study over the next few weeks.

187
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 I want to ask you a question. When was the most critical time in the whole history of the Jewish nation?

188
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 You might say, "Pastor John, it was the Holocaust when 6 million Jews were executed."

189
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 And I say to you, though Hitler massacred 6 million Jews, many Jews survived in different parts of the world.

190
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 In Esther's time, Haman was on the verge of wiping out the entire Jewish race.

191
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 That's a crisis. The death warrant was already signed and chopped.

192
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 When Esther risked her life and entered the king's presence and requested mercy and pardon for the Jewish people.

193
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 We read Esther 4. We'll read this again in a few weeks. Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai.

194
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 "Go gather all the Jews who are in Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day.

195
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 I and my maids will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king. And even though it is against the law,

196
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 and if I perish, I perish." Number 8, we fast to seek God's direction.

197
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 The book of Ezra, we don't read that very often, chapter 8. "There by the Ahava Canal, I proclaim a fast

198
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 so that we might humble ourselves before our God and ask him for a safe journey for thousands of our children with our possessions."

199
00:19:51,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 And then we read in Ezra 8.23, "So we fasted and petitioned our God about this. And he answered our prayer."

200
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 We know there are a lot of people in our church seeking God's direction for their life, especially at the moment.

201
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 When we need God's direction, when we're confused about which way we have to go, one of the best things we can do is to fast.

202
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 This is especially true for personal relationships, i.e. a marriage partner or a possible career move.

203
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 And lastly, but not least, we fast to obtain understanding and divine revelation.

204
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 We as a church need revelation. We need understanding of matters. We need to understand situations or biblical truths.

205
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 Jeremiah said in chapter 36, "So you go to the house of the Lord on the day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll

206
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 the words of the Lord that you wrote as I dictated. Read to them all the people of Judah who come in from their towns."

207
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Sometimes the understanding comes as we fast. Sometimes later on.

208
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 Fasting is both common in the Bible, both the Old Testament and the New Testament, and in church history.

209
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Jesus did it. Almost every great church leader over the centuries has done it.

210
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 It has a close connection to church revival.

211
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Now this is important. Fasting is not to earn brownie points.

212
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Can I just say today, straight off, God will not love you anymore because you fast.

213
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 You cannot earn brownie points with God.

214
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 But it does make a connection to a supernatural God.

215
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Put simply, it clears out the pipe that connects us to God's anointing.

216
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 You are humbling yourself. You see your priorities more clearly. You see balance returned to your life.

217
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 You see selfish ambition and pride washed away.

218
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 You will be more sensitive to God's Holy Spirit.

219
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Your areas of weakness and susceptibility will rise to the surface so that God can deal with them.

220
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 But I know the question you're asking. How? How do I fast?

221
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 I sincerely believe that God wants to strip away the mystery and shed his light on this wonderful and simple tool for triumph in our lives and in our church.

222
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Most problems concern the legalistic ideas of what a fast is and what a fast isn't.

223
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 The good news? This is not a legalistic fast.

224
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 No one is going to tell you what to do.

225
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 No one is going to tell you how to fast. It is between you and God.

226
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 You ask the Holy Spirit to tell you.

227
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 But we are going to try and help and encourage you.

228
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 We are going to attempt to answer some FAQs.

229
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Firstly, it's not a diet.

230
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Although a by-product may be weight loss.

231
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 What are the things to avoid?

232
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Acidic juices.

233
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Orange, grapefruit.

234
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 If you have them, dilute them 1 to 5.

235
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 Apple juice is good, but what sugar?

236
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Dilute it. Yuck!

237
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Other things.

238
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 I suggest abstaining from meat and/or desserts.

239
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 Abstain from TV.

240
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Computer.

241
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 For me, Facebook.

242
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 Email.

243
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Music.

244
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 And give the time to God.

245
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Spend the time in the Word of God.

246
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Get your face out of Facebook and get your face into the book.

247
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 This leads to the next question.

248
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 How do I spend the time?

249
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Pray.

250
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Seek God.

251
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Full stop.

252
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Please respect your body during fasting.

253
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Don't be cruel to your body.

254
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 If you feel weaker, sit down and rest.

255
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 Regular water.

256
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 You may need to amend your normal exercise.

257
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 It's not the time to do the mackerel trail.

258
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 But you are the boss.

259
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Tell your body, "I'm the boss!"

260
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 If your body says, "I'm hungry," you say, "Shut up!"

261
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 How do I start?

262
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Start small.

263
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 In moderation.

264
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 Just as you don't start jogging by running a marathon.

265
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 We doubt whether a 21 or 40 day fast is the best way to begin fasting.

266
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 It is just as scriptural to do a one day fast or even a partial fast.

267
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Generally, everyone can go one day without food, water or any other liquid.

268
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 We are planning a three day fast.

269
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 A three day fast is a good way to kick off fasting.

270
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 How do I break the fast?

271
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 Not with a huge juicy steak and extra fries.

272
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 Or four big mac meals.

273
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 You will hurt yourself.

274
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 You need wisdom.

275
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 How do we come into the fast?

276
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Not, "I'm going to have a big blowout tonight because I'm fasting tomorrow."

277
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 How do we break the fast?

278
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 We suggest small helpings of fresh fruit.

279
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Some salad.

280
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 Some coleslaw.

281
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Some yogurt or USA yogurt.

282
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 What are the different types of fast?

283
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 The first one is a complete fast.

284
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Eat or drink nothing.

285
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 Not normally recommended.

286
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 We are not recommending this.

287
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 The body can normally only understand three days.

288
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 This is a fast of desperation, all out hunger and urgency.

289
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 If you ever feel called to fast in this way, come and tell us first.

290
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Secondly, is what I call a normal fast.

291
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Suggested for those who have fasted before.

292
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Like Jesus, total abstention from food with a regular intake of water.

293
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 I suggest distilled water.

294
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 It flushes the poison out of your system.

295
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 A squeeze of lemon juice often helps the taste.

296
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 Or herbal tea.

297
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 Avoid tea, coffee and other caffeinated drinks.

298
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 Number three, a partial, sometimes called a Daniel fast.

299
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Recommended if you have never fasted before.

300
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 At least at first.

301
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 If you look at the book of Daniel, Daniel ate no meat.

302
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 But did eat veggies and did drink water.

303
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 God will honour this as much as he will a total fast.

304
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 Daniel 10 says, at this time I, Daniel, mourned for three weeks.

305
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 I ate no choice food, no meat or wine touched my lips.

306
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And I used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over.

307
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 This is a model for our three day fast.

308
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 No meat, wine or fine foods.

309
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 But read my lips.

310
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Be led by the Holy Spirit.

311
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And lastly, a corporate or a group fast.

312
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 There is great power when a group or a nation fast together.

313
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 And that is why we are planning as a church and as a city to do so.

314
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 A corporate fast turned God's wrath from Nineveh in the story of Jonah.

315
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 Ezra called one, Esther called one, Jehoshaphat called one.

316
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Joel beseeched the people to call one.

317
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 And the Hong Kong church is calling one.

318
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 I want to finish by talking about the great power of the corporate fast.

319
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I've called it the great crescendo.

320
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Matthew 18 says, "Again I tell you, if two of you on earth agree on anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven."

321
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 What we are is, I believe, a great orchestra.

322
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 We saw that online this weekend as so many people came together.

323
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Listen to a violin play. It's beautiful.

324
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Listen to a trumpet play. It's stirring.

325
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 When all the instruments play together, it's a symphony.

326
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 When you fast and pray, you are like that violin. Beautiful.

327
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 When we fast and pray together, we are like a great orchestra in harmony with great power.

328
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 We believe that God is calling this church and this city to great things in 2020 and beyond.

329
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Church, and this is important.

330
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 We believe that as we come together in harmony, firstly with each other, and secondly with God's Holy Spirit, then things will change.

331
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 See this as a blessing, not an inconvenience.

332
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Ask the Holy Spirit to lead you in the type of fast you undertake.

333
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 Don't get too hung up on this.

334
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 What is important is your heart.

335
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 Johnny and Michelle are going to come and lead us in prayer right now.
