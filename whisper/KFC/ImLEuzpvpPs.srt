1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
 Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,040
 Just to see if you're still awake.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,280
 All right.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,280
 So it looks like it will be the last time I'm preaching as pastor of the English congregation.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,600
 I'm very, you know, just glad that I got to serve you all this time.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,680
 And I just want to say I love you all.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,720
 And thank you.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,640
 And our relationship really doesn't end here.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,560
 We're going to keep in touch and then we're going to gather and eat together.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,960
 It's what Chinese people do.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:41,400
 And yeah, so I'm excited also for what's happening with KFCI with Pastor James' leadership.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,280
 And this is going to be exciting.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
 We're all one church, are we not?

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,400
 If there's nothing else we learn from Pastor John, he does this all the time, right?

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
 One church.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
 All right.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,000
 He said I would be the only thing that stands between you and sushi tonight.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,440
 So I will try to, I will try my best.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,680
 All right.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,560
 So tonight we're going to look at the heart of Jesus that transforms.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,200
 Today we're going to look at Jesus and a tax collector from Luke 19, verse 1 to 10.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,520
 Now here's a record of Jesus passing through Jericho and he meets this wealthy chief tax

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
 collector called Zacchaeus.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,560
 Now he was short, so he can't see Jesus in the crowd.

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,720
 So what do you do?

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,600
 You go and climb a tree, right?

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,680
 So he went ahead, climbed up on a tree just so he can know more about Jesus.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,760
 Now when Jesus finally got to where he was, he looked up and said, Zacchaeus, immediately

29
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
 come down.

30
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,680
 I must stay at your house tonight.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
 All right.

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,800
 Now who's upset about this?

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,800
 The crowd.

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,120
 Are we not surprised?

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,120
 The crowd's always upset and they're upset.

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
 Why are they upset?

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,240
 Well, because they said he's a sinner.

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,520
 How can Jesus be going to a sinner's home?

39
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,640
 But they were not bothered by it.

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,600
 And Zacchaeus gladly came down and he actually says that he will give half of his possession,

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,400
 50%, wow, half of his possession to the poor.

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,160
 And also he's going to pay back four-folds of whatever it is if he ever cheated anyone.

43
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,280
 That is amazing.

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,480
 Now in Judaism, it's recognized that when you give away 20% of your possession, that's

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,440
 already considered very generous.

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,760
 Now who wants to, maybe I should do an altar call.

47
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,320
 Who wants to give 50% of all that you have right now?

48
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
 Anybody?

49
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
 All right.

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,320
 That's okay.

51
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,600
 Ask the Lord if that statement moved your heart.

52
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,200
 But in Judaism, 20% was already a lot.

53
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,120
 And also with the Mosaic law, even if he had cheated someone, he only needed to pay two

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,400
 times and yet he paid four times.

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,080
 So he's way beyond what the law imposed.

56
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,920
 Now isn't this mind-blowing, unbelievable thing?

57
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,600
 Now this radical transformation, doesn't it captivate us?

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,880
 But kind of deep inside we're like, let's hope that's not me, right?

59
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:28,160
 But it leaves us wondering, what was it that made Zacchaeus respond this way?

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,200
 Now could it be that, think about it, Jesus was able to call his name.

61
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,840
 So he probably knew who he was.

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,160
 Was it because he's so moved, wow, God knew my name.

63
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,880
 And so he responded in gratitude?

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,480
 Maybe.

65
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,160
 But we also see that Jesus was able to call many people's name and even tell them about

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,800
 their lives.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:58,280
 Now could it be that it was because he knew he was a sinner and that everybody else also

68
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,840
 knew who he was and nobody wanted to be with him?

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,220
 So the very fact that the God of the universe wanted to be with him, he must be so grateful

70
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,760
 that he wanted to give back.

71
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,020
 Maybe.

72
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,020
 But if that was the case, didn't we see many other sinners?

73
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,460
 Jesus hang out with them.

74
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:24,460
 He stayed with them and he even forgave their sins.

75
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:32,540
 So tonight we're going to unpack that mystery together so that we could understand how it

76
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,860
 is that we can interact with Jesus.

77
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,380
 Now let's look a bit at the background.

78
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,020
 The Bible says that Jesus was passing through Jericho.

79
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:47,660
 Now Jericho is a city with lucrative produce and exports, so it's a vibrant city.

80
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,420
 Now tax collectors were despised.

81
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,020
 You know why?

82
00:04:52,020 --> 00:05:00,300
 Because most of the time in that era, they would overcharge and then pocket some of those.

83
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,260
 Now if you think about it, this is a chief of tax collector.

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,060
 So imagine he's probably the culprit of all these crimes.

85
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,740
 So he wasn't liked by the crowd.

86
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,000
 This is what we know about Zacchaeus.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,020
 He is wealthy, he's short, he's not liked by the crowd, and he's even kind of thought

88
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,540
 of as a traitor because he works for the Roman Empire.

89
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:32,620
 So this figure, he doesn't really know Jesus as well.

90
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,180
 And so here we see that he talks about how Zacchaeus wanted to climb up the tree.

91
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,180
 What was the reason?

92
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,740
 Does anybody remember?

93
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,020
 Not only to see Jesus, but to see who Jesus was.

94
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,060
 Now on the other side of the picture, who do we have?

95
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,060
 Jesus, right?

96
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,860
 So he's been traveling through the land and what does he usually do?

97
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:00,940
 Well, he rebukes those that are self-righteous and he hangs out with the sinners and he forgives

98
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,540
 them and he loves them and extends mercy to them.

99
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,580
 So this is kind of like, okay, Jesus is kind of doing what he has been doing all along

100
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,140
 with Zacchaeus.

101
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,780
 And actually verse 10 literally sums up Jesus' ministry and his life.

102
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,220
 "For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."

103
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,020
 So here it is, we see two characters.

104
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:30,060
 One person, Zacchaeus, curious about who Jesus was.

105
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,660
 And now the other person is Jesus, who knew exactly who he was looking for, the lost one.

106
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,180
 And Zacchaeus was his target.

107
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,580
 So while Zacchaeus was only curious, Jesus knew.

108
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,260
 And this brings us to our first point, that if we want to be transformed, how is it that

109
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,940
 we can be transformed?

110
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,420
 When we want to know Jesus.

111
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:58,220
 Jesus already has a heart to transform anyone, okay?

112
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,340
 But this is not a one-way street, it's a two-way street.

113
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,860
 And it requires an interaction.

114
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:14,100
 And so what we see is that it required that Zacchaeus really wanted to know Jesus.

115
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,020
 Now there's something special about Zacchaeus' wanting to know Jesus.

116
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,680
 Now wasn't there a crowd?

117
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,420
 Remember there was a crowd?

118
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,740
 So there's a lot of people who are going after Jesus.

119
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:32,220
 But what is so special about Zacchaeus' desire to know Jesus?

120
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,280
 Well you see, a lot of people at that time went to Jesus for a few things.

121
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,020
 They wanted to see miracles.

122
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,660
 They wanted to get healed.

123
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,880
 And they even wanted to know how to have eternal life.

124
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,820
 They wanted to hear good teachings.

125
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,960
 And you know what?

126
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:57,060
 They all came with some sort of motive to get something from Jesus.

127
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:04,900
 And yet in here it says that Zacchaeus only had one motive, that he wanted to know who

128
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
 Jesus was.

129
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:13,460
 And you know, the name Zacchaeus actually means pure and innocent.

130
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,180
 And we just heard about the background of who he was, right?

131
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,180
 There's nothing pure and innocent about him.

132
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,740
 And yet his name already reveals this heart.

133
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,660
 I just want to know who Jesus was.

134
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,800
 Now this really comes back to a question for us, you know.

135
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,120
 When we go to Jesus, I mean first of all, do we even go to Jesus?

136
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,540
 Do we actually allocate time to be with him?

137
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,860
 But when we're actually there with him, what is it that we pray about?

138
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,860
 What do we want?

139
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,980
 Is it to pass an exam?

140
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,040
 To get a spouse?

141
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,740
 To fix that relationship?

142
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,700
 Get that job?

143
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,100
 And maybe get rid of a certain boss that you don't like?

144
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,620
 What is it, right?

145
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,100
 We actually go to him with some sort of motive.

146
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,220
 Maybe, I mean not you guys, some other people.

147
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,780
 Definitely not you guys.

148
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,700
 So we need to really reflect and ask, do we have the heart of Zacchaeus?

149
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:18,300
 And if we do, we can be also transformed by God.

150
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,140
 Now we compare it to a rich ruler in the last chapter.

151
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:27,180
 In chapter 18, there was a rich ruler and he went to Jesus and he asked him this, "Good

152
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,100
 teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"

153
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,620
 You see, this ruler was similar to Zacchaeus.

154
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,180
 He was rich, he was in power.

155
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,100
 And yet what was he looking for?

156
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,740
 Eternal life.

157
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,980
 What was Jesus to him?

158
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,660
 A pathway to something better.

159
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,340
 He was not after Jesus.

160
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:58,100
 And so we really need to be careful for ourselves as well that when we look for Jesus, is there

161
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
 just...

162
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:03,380
 I mean, we might say, "Yeah, I'm going to Jesus for this, but I'm also going for that."

163
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,380
 I mean, it's not wrong.

164
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,060
 I don't want to say, "Okay, starting from now on, no one prays for any needs."

165
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,980
 That's not what we're talking about.

166
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:17,340
 But really at the very core, why are we going to him?

167
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:24,500
 And so as we read on, we see that Jesus reaches the spot where Zacchaeus was.

168
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,580
 And he said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down immediately.

169
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,020
 I must stay at your home."

170
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,800
 Now it's quite interesting.

171
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,460
 It's not like, "Hey, Pastor James, can I stay at your place?"

172
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,120
 At least I would say, "Can I stay?"

173
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,660
 It's almost like he didn't need to.

174
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,660
 It's a self-invitation.

175
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,500
 "I must stay at your place."

176
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,540
 Now who would just say...

177
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,700
 Do you just randomly say, "I must stay at your place"?

178
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,100
 No.

179
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,940
 It almost sounds like you would only say it if it's your good friend, your buddy.

180
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,740
 You don't even need to ask permission.

181
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,540
 Actually, when we see their interaction, "Come down immediately," and then he goes down immediately.

182
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,060
 What does that kind of look like?

183
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,940
 It's almost like you haven't seen an old friend for a long time now.

184
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,620
 Remember COVID, we didn't go to the airport for three years, right?

185
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,260
 So imagine your friend now coming to Hong Kong to visit you.

186
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,340
 And then you're at the airport waiting for him to come out, and you see on that little

187
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,680
 screen where they zoom in on the people that are exiting, right?

188
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,620
 You see that person, and then you start rushing over to the exit.

189
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,700
 And as soon as the other person sees you, they rush over as well.

190
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,700
 And what do you say?

191
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:38,220
 You're like, "Oh my goodness, we haven't seen each other for so long.

192
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,140
 We must hang out tonight.

193
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,940
 We must go for a drink or something."

194
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,340
 This is talking about God's...

195
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,940
 Jesus' eagerness to be with Zacchaeus.

196
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,100
 And we see the same thing responded by Zacchaeus.

197
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,900
 He's equally excited.

198
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,620
 So this brings us to our second point.

199
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:05,260
 We transform when Jesus is our only treasure.

200
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:14,140
 You see, in here, Jesus and Zacchaeus, they both cherished each other.

201
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:20,140
 Now it might be one thing that we have heard about Jesus, heard about God, but it's another

202
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,220
 thing to actually experience him and see him face to face.

203
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:30,620
 And yet it's a third thing to put him as your treasure.

204
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,020
 So we might read about how great God is to the Israelites.

205
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,580
 We've read how Jesus healed the sick and the blind.

206
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,700
 But have we also personally experienced God?

207
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,660
 Maybe some of us here says, "Yeah, I've also experienced God.

208
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,660
 I've prayed to him before, and he was faithful.

209
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,860
 I know him."

210
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,940
 My second question though would be, then have we treasured him?

211
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,900
 Is he our treasure?

212
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,500
 Now why do I say that?

213
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:08,140
 It's because if we look at the reference to the rich ruler in the last chapter, remember

214
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,100
 he was asking Jesus, "How is it that I can obtain eternal life?"

215
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,500
 And you know what did Jesus answer in verse 20 until 23?

216
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
 I'll read it to you.

217
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,460
 He says, "You know the commandments.

218
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,420
 You shall not commit adultery.

219
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,420
 You shall not murder.

220
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,860
 You shall not steal.

221
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,620
 You shall not give false testimony.

222
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,140
 Honor your father and your mother.

223
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,920
 All these," the ruler says, "I have kept since I was a boy."

224
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,020
 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "You still lack one thing.

225
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,820
 Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.

226
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,880
 Then come, follow me."

227
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,060
 And when he heard this, he became very sad because he was very wealthy.

228
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:00,500
 Now the rich ruler wanted to work for his eternal life.

229
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
 What can I do?

230
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,580
 What can I do to get it?

231
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,300
 And Jesus says, "Okay.

232
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,940
 Do you want to do a deal with me?

233
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,540
 Do you want to deal with me?

234
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,540
 Okay.

235
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,260
 Let me tell you what you can do.

236
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,260
 You've done everything.

237
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,260
 Okay.

238
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
 Sell everything you have.

239
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,260
 Follow me."

240
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,260
 The deal worked well.

241
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,740
 He was not like Zacchaeus.

242
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:31,460
 He was looking at Jesus to get to his treasure.

243
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,540
 He didn't view Jesus as the treasure.

244
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,340
 He wanted something else.

245
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,260
 But that was not the case for Zacchaeus.

246
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,180
 For Zacchaeus, Jesus was the treasure.

247
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,820
 That was the lottery.

248
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,620
 But this ruler, he missed it.

249
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,420
 So you might ask now, "Okay.

250
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,180
 Then do I need to sell everything?"

251
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,380
 Is that a yes or no?

252
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,380
 You guys are afraid to answer my question.

253
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,820
 I will ask again.

254
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,820
 Do we need to sell everything?

255
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,820
 Possibly.

256
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,820
 Yes.

257
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
 Oh, great.

258
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:20,460
 This man, the offering box is right at the back there.

259
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:31,060
 The answer is yes, if you have a transactional relationship with God.

260
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:38,820
 And the answer is no, if you have a face-to-face, heart-to-heart, authentic relationship with

261
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,700
 God.

262
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:46,580
 Because if Jesus was your treasure, it actually didn't matter if you needed to sell things

263
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,580
 or not.

264
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,020
 See, you're right.

265
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
 It just didn't matter.

266
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,900
 He is already your treasure.

267
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,900
 If he asked you to sell it, sell it.

268
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,580
 But if some other thing is your treasure, then no.

269
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:05,340
 But if that's the case, then Jesus asked that you sell it to follow him.

270
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:12,980
 And so it really makes us think, what's a treasure in your heart?

271
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:22,020
 What is that one thing or two or maybe three that you really hold on to that's more important,

272
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,860
 more precious than Jesus?

273
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,180
 Now I remember at a time when I had a calling to go into ministry.

274
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:38,260
 And back then I was struggling because I was a research analyst in an iBank.

275
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,700
 And I was making decent money.

276
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,740
 And when I heard about the calling, I was like, OK, maybe for a few more years.

277
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,460
 Maybe for a few-- I just want to delay it.

278
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,060
 We'll see.

279
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,940
 But eventually God helped me to overcome.

280
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,580
 And he gave me faith to step forward.

281
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,420
 But I wanted to say that wasn't the hard treasure.

282
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,100
 There was a harder one.

283
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,780
 Now back then I was still single.

284
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,900
 And I really wanted to get married.

285
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:14,860
 And then my mentor told me, you know, what if God says, I'm not going to give you a spouse?

286
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,820
 I told him, I said, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

287
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,820
 That's not how God works.

288
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,140
 I said, look at Abraham.

289
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,180
 He never says, oh, it's OK if you don't give me a son.

290
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,780
 He keeps praying for it, right?

291
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,020
 So I said, no, that's not how it works.

292
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:37,140
 And yet over the years at that moment, it was something that haunted me.

293
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,660
 And it was to a point where-- actually, I worked at Deutsche Bank.

294
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:45,260
 And so my co-worker, which I was trying to spread the gospel to, she seemed to have everything

295
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,260
 together.

296
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,500
 She had husband.

297
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,820
 And I think back then, I wasn't sure if she had a kid.

298
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,100
 But you know, she just had everything.

299
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,860
 And then I still remember in our conversation, I said, hey, do you want to come to our Friday

300
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,860
 fellowship?

301
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,540
 And I forgot exactly what I was inviting her to.

302
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,700
 And then she's like, oh, poor Michelle.

303
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,540
 All you have left is God.

304
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:14,900
 And I have to admit, though, at that time, I felt sorry for myself.

305
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,060
 Why?

306
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,100
 Because Jesus was one of my treasures.

307
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,580
 He was in all of my treasures.

308
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:28,700
 I felt sorry for myself because I didn't have what she had.

309
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,860
 And I even bargained with God.

310
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,060
 I said, you know, you want me to spread the gospel.

311
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,180
 But how about giving me this picture perfect so then I can go to her and say, hey, do you

312
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,420
 want to believe in God?

313
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,100
 Of course, God did not listen to me.

314
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:49,020
 But eventually, over years of struggles, he actually helped me to a point where I said,

315
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,340
 yes, Lord.

316
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:57,540
 It would be OK because you alone are enough for me.

317
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,580
 And I want to say transformation happened at that point.

318
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,180
 I was freed of the bondage.

319
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,740
 I no longer needed to think, oh, what if I can't have kids?

320
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,060
 What if this and that?

321
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,900
 I was like, all right, I'm free.

322
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:12,900
 I don't have to if God didn't give it to me.

323
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:20,300
 Transformation happened because God, Jesus was my treasure, not something else.

324
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,180
 And honestly, having God wasn't good enough.

325
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,660
 It was the perfect thing.

326
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,500
 And it was the only one I need.

327
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:39,740
 So also, I want to say FYI as a test, whatever situation you're going through, ask yourself,

328
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,980
 all you have got left is God.

329
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,880
 And if you feel sorry for yourself, then I have to say I'm sorry.

330
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,660
 You probably have some other treasures in your heart that is blocking you from true

331
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:59,020
 joy, blocking you from this true relationship.

332
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,220
 So remember the first question that I was asking, I was like, oh, what was it that really

333
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:09,060
 made Zacchaeus have this huge transformation?

334
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:17,100
 The answer is because he had a relationship that was heart to heart, not a transactional

335
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
 one.

336
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:28,100
 And because of that, as it leads to our third point, where we transform, when we make Jesus

337
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:35,860
 our Lord, once he is your only treasure, you can now make him your Lord.

338
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:44,060
 Now remember in verse eight, he actually says, "Look, Lord, here and now I give half of my

339
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,840
 possessions to the poor.

340
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,120
 And if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount."

341
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,760
 He says, "Look, Lord."

342
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:09,560
 Remember he didn't know who God was, but he saw this treasure and he says, "That is mine."

343
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:19,420
 In Matthew 13, 45 to 46, it says, "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking

344
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,560
 for fine pearls.

345
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,600
 When he found one of great value, he went away and sold everything he had and bought

346
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
 it."

347
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,680
 I want to say Zacchaeus, that's what he did.

348
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:41,160
 He found that pearl and he sold everything and he made God his Lord.

349
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:48,160
 Now it is one thing to believe in God, because even the devil believes in God, that he is

350
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,160
 the son of God.

351
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,560
 Now in James 2.14, this is what we can see.

352
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,360
 "What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no

353
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,420
 deeds?

354
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,680
 Can such faith save them?"

355
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,440
 Some people might mistakenly think that, "Was this Zacchaeus' action?

356
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,080
 Did he gain salvation because of this action to give away his possessions and to repay?"

357
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,600
 Well, the answer is no.

358
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:26,020
 He already received salvation when he believed, except this faith, he backed it up with his

359
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,600
 action.

360
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:36,360
 When he called Lord, he didn't only believe that he was the son of God, he actually wanted

361
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,560
 to follow the way he would act.

362
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,840
 He did what Jesus liked.

363
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,080
 Jesus liked to take care of the poor, that's what he did.

364
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,800
 He is his Lord.

365
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:56,960
 Now in verse 18, as we read on from James 2-24, it says here, "But someone will say,

366
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,440
 'You have faith, I have deeds.

367
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,880
 Show me your faith without deeds and I will show you my faith with deeds.

368
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,100
 You believe that there is one God, good.

369
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,860
 Even the demons believe that and shudder.

370
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,660
 You foolish person.

371
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,920
 Do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?'"

372
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,200
 He's going to give evidence that faith without deeds is useless.

373
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,920
 "Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac?

374
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:35,800
 You see that his faith and his actions were working together and his faith was made complete

375
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,720
 by what he did.

376
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,880
 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, 'Abraham believed God and he was credited

377
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,640
 to him as righteousness and he was called God's friend.'

378
00:23:48,640 --> 00:24:00,040
 You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone."

379
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,840
 And it really tells us that faith by itself without deeds, it's dead.

380
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,760
 And what is it that we see Zacchaeus today?

381
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:18,080
 He had faith and deeds and with that his faith is complete.

382
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:27,120
 My question today to you is, my friends, is your faith complete?

383
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,120
 You might say, "I have faith in God."

384
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,920
 Oh great, even the demons do.

385
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,360
 Oh I love being compared to the demons.

386
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,240
 But is your faith complete?

387
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:47,920
 Do our actions actually reflect that, that he is our Lord?

388
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:59,040
 Today with Zacchaeus, he isn't just a man that saw Jesus and let Jesus pass by.

389
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,580
 He was a man that saw Jesus and he held on to him.

390
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:11,800
 I really believe that when God said, "I must stay in your house tonight."

391
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,080
 That he didn't only let him into his house.

392
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:25,600
 He led him into his heart and he took complete control of who Zacchaeus is.

393
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,000
 Today we're talking about transformation.

394
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,800
 Jesus is looking for the lost one and he's very willing to transform all of us, except

395
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,480
 it's a two-way street.

396
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,960
 We saw that many people in the Bible as well, they saw Jesus, but how many responded like

397
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
 Zacchaeus?

398
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,840
 And you know what?

399
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,600
 God called, Jesus called him what?

400
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,560
 The son of Abraham.

401
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,020
 Because he did exactly what Abraham did.

402
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:12,480
 He backed up his faith with his action.

403
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:21,360
 I believe that God tonight is calling your name in the city of Hong Kong and he says,

404
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:29,360
 "I must stay in your house tonight.

405
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,960
 I must stay in your heart tonight."

406
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,080
 Will we let him?

407
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,000
 Or will we be like the rich ruler?

408
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,440
 The rich ruler wanted Jesus to get to other treasures and he had treasures in his heart

409
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,680
 that blocked him from following Jesus.

410
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,680
 Of course he won't call Jesus his Lord and he went away very sad.

411
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,840
 Or will we be like Zacchaeus?

412
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:16,760
 Or we only go to Jesus because all we want is to know him, nothing else.

413
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,400
 And that he is the treasure of our hearts.

414
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,520
 We make him our Lord.

415
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,880
 But how can we do this?

416
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,360
 How is it that we can do this?

417
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:31,600
 You might say, "Yes, Michelle, okay, I kind of get it now, but how can I do this?"

418
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,320
 Do you know how?

419
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,960
 It is when we have an authentic relationship with him.

420
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,640
 Don't we just go to God and say, "God, all I want is you.

421
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,040
 Maybe I have some things in my heart, but please help me take those away."

422
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:54,360
 Just like my struggles, they might have taken some years.

423
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,200
 But if you're willing, God is here and he will transform you.

424
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,520
 So tonight, I believe that God is speaking to all of us.

425
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:13,800
 Will you choose to be the ruler or will you choose to be Zacchaeus and let God into your

426
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,960
 heart and be the king of your heart?

427
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,040
 Let us pray together.

428
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:33,440
 Dear Heavenly Father, I want to come before you and just repent.

429
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:43,960
 I'm sure we all have at some point came to you as if you're a vending machine, a genie.

430
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:50,360
 There's treasures in our hearts that we won't forgo.

431
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:56,640
 But Father, help us to open up our eyes.

432
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,960
 Help us to have an authentic relationship with you.

433
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,280
 You were friends with Abraham.

434
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,400
 We want to be friends with you.

435
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:14,600
 So Father, help us in all that we do.

436
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:22,400
 Allow us, help us to cherish you, make you our Lord, and to have a wonderful friendship

437
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,560
 with you.

438
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,360
 You are the king of our hearts, the Lord of all.

439
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

440
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:30,720
 Amen.

441
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:40,720
