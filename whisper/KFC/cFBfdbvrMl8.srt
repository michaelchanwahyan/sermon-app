1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
 I get the privilege of closing this series as Peter closes his letter.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,220
 The Book of 1 Peter contains so much.

3
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,480
 In a way, we haven't been able to do it justice.

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:35,800
 It might take a 10, 11, 12 week series and I look at every verse.

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:46,600
 But in another way, in a world that is devoid of hope, we have, and I must thank our speakers

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
 here.

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,600
 I must thank our speakers, James and Johnny, Michelle, and last week, Gabe.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,240
 And James, 33.

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:08,160
 Our speakers have, I felt, clearly articulated the living hope that we hold as believers.

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,560
 Now, those of you who know me well, you know I like pictures and I've got another one for

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,560
 you.

12
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
 Okay.

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:25,760
 As I prayed for this sermon, as I prayed about the series, I was given the picture of God

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,240
 parting the Red Sea through Moses.

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,880
 Now let's look at this for a moment.

16
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,880
 The world at the moment feels like there are waves that are upon us.

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,080
 We've got COVID, we've got political uncertainty, we've got economic uncertainty.

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:56,080
 But God used Moses and he parted the Red Sea.

19
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,040
 Now there are two things about this.

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:11,040
 Number one, when God parted the Red Sea, it did not disappear.

21
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,480
 So actually, as we look at 1 Peter, as we look at what it is to have a living hope,

22
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,680
 COVID is still going to be there.

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,400
 Political uncertainty is still going to be there.

24
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,720
 Economic uncertainty is still going to be there.

25
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,880
 But what God is saying to us, and I believe he's using 1 Peter to do this, is I will use

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
 you.

27
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:45,560
 I will use this teaching for you to find a way through these things.

28
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,760
 The second thing which is very, very important, and I felt as I prayed about this, if you

29
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,160
 look in Moses' hand, he has a staff.

30
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,200
 Now if you did a general knowledge quiz today and someone said, "Who parted the Red Sea?"

31
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,840
 I guess 90% of people would say Moses.

32
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,400
 Moses did not part the Red Sea.

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,000
 God parted the Red Sea, but God used Moses.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,760
 And God said to Moses two things, "What is in your hand?"

35
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,000
 "I just have a staff," he said.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,640
 He said, "Raise your staff."

37
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,920
 And I feel that God is saying, "Church, look at what's in your hand.

38
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,680
 Don't look at what you don't have.

39
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:50,680
 Don't look at X, Y, Z church or ABC Christian and say, 'I haven't got what they've got.'

40
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,440
 What is in your hand?"

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,760
 And church, lift your staff.

42
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,600
 If you're able to at home, yeah, lift your hand, lift your staff, because God said, "I

43
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:11,640
 made a way through the Red Sea, and I am the living hope who will make a way through these

44
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,320
 difficult times."

45
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:26,160
 Now Peter has in his letter spent much of it addressing different groups.

46
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,560
 We've had husbands and wives, slaves and masters.

47
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:41,640
 And he begins chapter five by addressing us older people.

48
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,520
 He says, "Be shepherds."

49
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:54,740
 And for you younger people, that is everybody online apart from me and Joseph, he addresses

50
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:00,560
 the younger people to submit.

51
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:15,680
 But my aim tonight is to highlight a path through the Red Sea for us, all of us, now

52
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,880
 in 2021.

53
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:28,360
 And to do that, I want to pick up this letter at the point that Peter says, "Hey, all of

54
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,880
 you, let's read it."

55
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:46,600
 He said, "Yes, all of you be submissive to one another and be clothed with humility.

56
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,040
 For God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.

57
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:02,680
 Therefore, humble yourself under the mighty act of God, that he might exalt you in due

58
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:11,880
 time, casting all your care upon him, for he cares for you."

59
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,040
 Now sorry, I've lost my file.

60
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:26,380
 As he closed this letter, Peter gave the church three important instructions to obey if they

61
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,900
 were to glorify God in this difficult experience.

62
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:39,200
 They are the same three that he gives us in 2021.

63
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,480
 Let's look at them.

64
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,080
 They are number one, be humble.

65
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,120
 Number two, be watchful.

66
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,760
 And number three, be hopeful.

67
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,120
 Let's look at them one at a time.

68
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,960
 Firstly, be humble.

69
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:10,660
 Peter said, "Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God."

70
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:14,000
 I want you to use the chat line now.

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,100
 I want you to say in a word or words, what describes to you being humble?

72
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,280
 What does being humble mean to you?

73
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:39,360
 Let's have some suggestions.

74
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,640
 Being grounded says Julian.

75
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,720
 Think higher of others.

76
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,420
 Serving others before self, Michelle.

77
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,420
 Thank you.

78
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,200
 Tony, don't take credit.

79
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,840
 Paul and Jackie have a serving heart.

80
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,800
 George, not thinking too highly of yourself.

81
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:01,920
 Charlotte, the same thing, not thinking of yourself too much.

82
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,960
 Listen before speaking, says Ken.

83
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:13,160
 Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.

84
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:20,300
 Thank you, Sterling, seeing everyone higher or better than me and myself at the lowest.

85
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,840
 You don't need the rest of your sermon.

86
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,680
 You've just done it in the chat box.

87
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:33,420
 Now I always say in the Bible, when the word used is therefore, you have to ask yourself

88
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:39,120
 the question, what is it therefore?

89
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:54,160
 Now Peter had already warned the saints to be submissive and made the point, God can

90
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:05,340
 give that grace if and only if we humble ourselves before him.

91
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:16,680
 Proverbs 6 and 8 tells us that God resists the proud because God hates the sin of pride.

92
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,700
 It was pride that turned Lucifer into Satan.

93
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:29,860
 It was pride, a desire to be like God that stirred Eve to take the forbidden fruit.

94
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:37,580
 One John says the pride of life is an evidence of worldliness.

95
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:45,860
 My friends, the antidote to pride is the grace of God.

96
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:55,100
 And we receive that grace only when we yield ourselves to him.

97
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:05,300
 And the evidence of that grace is when we yield to each other.

98
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,300
 Submission is an act of faith.

99
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,780
 Can I say it again?

100
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,200
 Submission is an act of faith.

101
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:25,740
 We are trusting God to direct in our lives and to work out his purposes in his time.

102
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,120
 After all, there is a danger in submitting to others.

103
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:41,500
 They might take advantage of us, but not if we trust God and if we are truly submitted

104
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,480
 to one another.

105
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,840
 Now the key of course to this is in the phrase, I've highlighted it, in due time, that he

106
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:57,760
 might exalt you in due time.

107
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,700
 What does in due time mean?

108
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:11,900
 God never exalts anyone until that person is ready for it.

109
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:23,000
 First the cross, then the glory, first the suffering, and then the crown.

110
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:34,080
 Moses was under God's hands for 40 years before God sent him to deliver the Jews from Egypt.

111
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:44,440
 Joseph was under God's hand for at least 13 years before God lifted him to the throne.

112
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:52,120
 One of the evidences of our pride is our impatience with God.

113
00:11:52,120 --> 00:12:01,480
 And Peter repeatedly tells us that one reason for suffering is that we might learn patience

114
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,880
 to government authorities in 1 Peter 2.

115
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,720
 That slaves submit to masters in 1 Peter 2.

116
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,860
 And that wives submit to husbands.

117
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:18,300
 Now I've upset all the women, I'm sorry, but that's what the Bible says.

118
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:33,620
 Now he commanded all of the believers to submit to God and to submit to each other.

119
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:42,220
 I want to hear, reiterate KFCI's commitment to all age ministry.

120
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:50,060
 I have to say my heart was so full last week when Gabe preached to us.

121
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:56,540
 Because so often there is a generation war in church.

122
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,580
 With the older people resisting change.

123
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:06,060
 And the younger people resisting the older people.

124
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:14,060
 Which is why our A in Cameo is for all age.

125
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,580
 The solution is I believe twofold.

126
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,300
 I put it on the screen.

127
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:27,580
 All believers, young and old, should submit to one another.

128
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,380
 And secondly, all should submit to God.

129
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:42,420
 The expression be clothed with humility is Peter's answer to the problem.

130
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:50,600
 Just as Jesus laid aside his outer garments and put on a towel to become a servant.

131
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:57,740
 So each of us should have a servant attitude and minister to each other.

132
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:04,540
 C.S. Lewis says this, I think it was similar to what you said, George.

133
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:11,140
 Humility is not demeaning ourselves and thinking poorly of ourselves.

134
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:17,820
 It is simply not thinking of ourselves at all.

135
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:27,940
 Indeed, we can never be submissive to each other until we are first submissive to God.

136
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,060
 And Peter quoted Proverbs 3.34 to defend his point.

137
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,900
 A verse that is also quoted in James 4.6.

138
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,340
 God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.

139
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:45,140
 I'm sorry I'm getting excited.

140
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:51,540
 It takes grace to submit to another believer.

141
00:14:51,540 --> 00:15:00,260
 But here, Peter was referring to the words he heard Jesus say to him.

142
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:08,720
 For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled.

143
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,900
 Those who humble themselves will be exalted.

144
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:22,900
 One of the benefits of this kind of relationship with God is the privilege of letting him take

145
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,020
 care of our burdens.

146
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:34,820
 Unless we meet the conditions laid down in 1 Peter 5, we cannot claim the wonderful promise

147
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:43,980
 in 1 Peter 5, 7, casting all your care upon him for he cares for you.

148
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:53,820
 The word translated care means anxiety, the state of being pulled apart.

149
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,740
 I guess we all know how that feels at the moment when circumstances are difficult like

150
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,700
 now.

151
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:07,340
 It is easy for us to be anxious and worried.

152
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:17,820
 But if we are, we will miss God's blessing and become poor witnesses to the lost.

153
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,260
 I just want to pause there because I just sense in my heart that there are people listening

154
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:25,700
 tonight who really will identify with this.

155
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,620
 You feel anxious.

156
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,980
 You feel worried.

157
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:37,500
 But if we do, we may miss God's blessings.

158
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:45,460
 We need his inward peace if we are going to triumph in the fiery trial, triumph in the

159
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,700
 Red Sea and bring glory to his name.

160
00:16:49,700 --> 00:17:00,540
 In 1 Peter 5, 7, we must once and for all give all of our cares, past, present, and

161
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,580
 future to the Lord.

162
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:14,960
 We mustn't hand them to him piecemeal, keeping those cares that we think we can handle ourselves.

163
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:24,180
 If we keep the little cares for ourselves, they will soon become big problems.

164
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:33,500
 Each time a new burden arises, we must by faith, we must by faith remind the Lord and

165
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,140
 ourselves that we have already turned it over to him.

166
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:46,960
 Now if anybody knew that from experience that God cares for his own, it was Peter.

167
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,660
 When you read the four gospels, you would discover that Peter shared in some wonderful

168
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,360
 miracles.

169
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,520
 Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law.

170
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,380
 It gave him a great catch of fish.

171
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,460
 He helped him pay his temple tax.

172
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,760
 He helped him walk on the water.

173
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,760
 He repaired the damage that he did to the ear of Malchus.

174
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,480
 And he even delivered Peter from prison in Acts chapter 12.

175
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:27,760
 And it begs the question, how does God show his love and care for us when we give our

176
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,760
 cares to him?

177
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:37,680
 And I want to answer that by saying he performs four wonderful ministries on our behalf.

178
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,720
 Number one, he gives us courage to face our cares honestly.

179
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,960
 Number two, he gives us wisdom to understand the situation.

180
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,640
 Number three, he gives us strength to do what we must do.

181
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,360
 And number four, he gives us faith to trust him to do the rest.

182
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:06,880
 I want you to look at that slide for a moment.

183
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:16,560
 Some people give God their burdens and expect him to do everything.

184
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:26,240
 But my friends, it's important that we let him work in us as well as work for us.

185
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,400
 Can I just say that again?

186
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:37,840
 It's important that we let God work in us as well as work for us so that we will be

187
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,040
 prepared when the answer comes.

188
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,880
 Trust your burdens on the Lord and he will sustain you.

189
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,640
 Let's read on and find the second instruction.

190
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,600
 Be sober.

191
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,680
 I think that was for you, Michelle, after you had the communion wine.

192
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
 Okay.

193
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,960
 Be sober.

194
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,320
 Be vigilant.

195
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:11,000
 Because your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.

196
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,480
 Resist him.

197
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:22,760
 Steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood

198
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,760
 in the world.

199
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,480
 So here we have the second instruction.

200
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,120
 It is be watchful.

201
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,640
 He says in verse eight, be vigilant.

202
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,280
 Other versions say be alert.

203
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:46,440
 Now one reason that we have cares is because we have an enemy.

204
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,040
 As the serpent, Satan deceives.

205
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,280
 And as the lion, Satan devours.

206
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,360
 The word Satan means adversary.

207
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,720
 And the word devil means the accuser, the slanderer.

208
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,760
 Gabe told us last week that the recipient of this letter had already experienced the

209
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:23,680
 attacks of the slanderer and now would meet the lion in their fiery trial.

210
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:36,320
 And Peter gave them several practical instructions to help them get victory over their adversary.

211
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:44,160
 Now those of you who know me well will know I love words that start with R. So the first

212
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,960
 thing we're to do is this.

213
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,240
 We're to respect him.

214
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,400
 He is dangerous.

215
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:00,280
 Now this might surprise you to hear me say this.

216
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:06,440
 But no doubt Satan is a dangerous enemy.

217
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,760
 He is a serpent who can bite us when we least expect it.

218
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,960
 He is a destroyer and an accuser.

219
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:23,680
 He has great power, great intelligence, and a host of demons who assist him in his attacks

220
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,520
 against God's people.

221
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,680
 He is a formidable enemy.

222
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:39,000
 We should never joke about him, ignore him, or underestimate his ability.

223
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,960
 Peter says we must be sober and have our minds under control when it comes to conflict with

224
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,800
 Satan.

225
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:58,960
 Now a part of this soberness includes not blaming everything on the devil.

226
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:07,480
 Some people see a demon behind every bush and blame Satan for their headaches, their

227
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:14,360
 flat tires, or even their high rent in mid-levels.

228
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:21,520
 I heard a story of a lady who phoned her past a long distance to inform him that Satan had

229
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,440
 caused her to shrink three and a half inches.

230
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:36,400
 While I do have great respect for the wiles and the powers of the devil, I still feel

231
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:48,120
 we must get our information about him from the Bible and not from our own interpretation

232
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,480
 of experiences.

233
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,520
 My second R is recognize him.

234
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,360
 Scripture tells us he is a great pretender.

235
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,240
 I guess that's a cue for a song.

236
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:09,040
 Because he is a subtle foe, we must be vigilant and always on guard.

237
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,560
 His strategy is to counterfeit whatever God does.

238
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:23,760
 According to the parable of the tares in Matthew 13, whenever God plants a true Christian,

239
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,960
 Satan seeks to plant a counterfeit.

240
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:38,280
 One John 2 says he would deceive us were it not for the word of God and the spirit of

241
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,280
 God.

242
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:47,360
 The better we know God's word, the keener our spiritual senses will be to detect Satan

243
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,440
 at work.

244
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:58,960
 One John 4 says we must test the spirits and to know the false from the true and the true

245
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,280
 from the false.

246
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:10,720
 My last R and possibly the most important is that we resist him.

247
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:22,040
 This means that we take our stand on the word of God and refuse to be moved.

248
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:31,760
 Ephesians 6, the chapter about the armor of God, instructs us to firstly stand, then to

249
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,560
 withstand, and then thirdly to stand again.

250
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,920
 Unless we stand, we cannot withstand.

251
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:47,520
 Our weapons are the word of God and prayer, and our protection is the complete armor that

252
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,520
 God has given us.

253
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:58,040
 We resist him in the faith.

254
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,760
 That is our faith in God.

255
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,760
 Just as David took his stand against Goliath and trusted in the name of Jehovah, so we

256
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:14,000
 take our stand against Satan in the victorious name of Jesus Christ.

257
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,080
 Now a word of caution here.

258
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:25,440
 Never discuss things with Satan or his associates.

259
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:33,640
 We've made that mistake and we all know the sad consequences.

260
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:41,560
 Also never try to fight with Satan in your own way.

261
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:47,240
 Resist him the way Jesus did with the word of God.

262
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,880
 And Peter tells us never get the idea that you're the only one going through these battles

263
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:59,160
 because we are all facing the same trials.

264
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:08,200
 Church, we must pray for one another and encourage one another in the Lord.

265
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,400
 And just remember our personal victories will help others, just as their victories will

266
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,680
 help us.

267
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:22,920
 Had Peter obeyed these instructions the night Jesus was arrested, he would not have gone

268
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,960
 to sleep in the garden.

269
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:34,160
 He would not attack Malchus the servant and he would not have denied Jesus.

270
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:39,480
 He did not take the Lord's warning seriously.

271
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:45,080
 In fact, he argued with him.

272
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:53,640
 Not only did he recognize Satan when the adversary inflated his ego with pride, told him he didn't

273
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,240
 have to watch and pray, and then incited him to use his sword.

274
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,480
 Had Peter listened to the Lord and resisted the enemy, he would have escaped all of these

275
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,840
 failures.

276
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:19,040
 Both Peter and James give us the same formula for success.

277
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:27,160
 Therefore, submit to God.

278
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:35,760
 Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

279
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:47,400
 But before we can stand before Satan, we must bow before God.

280
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:55,560
 Peter resisted the Lord and ended up submitting to Satan.

281
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,560
 Let's read on and find the last instruction.

282
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:08,200
 "But may the God of all grace who called us to his eternal glory by Jesus Christ, after

283
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:16,560
 you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.

284
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,760
 To him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever.

285
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,800
 Amen."

286
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,760
 Now last instruction, isn't it wonderful that we get to it?

287
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,280
 Be hopeful.

288
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,120
 Repeat it to yourself.

289
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:42,960
 The book of 1 Peter started with hope and finishes with hope.

290
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:50,080
 Peter closed on a positive note and reminded his readers that God knew what he was doing

291
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,400
 and was in complete control.

292
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:01,200
 No matter how difficult the fiery trial may become, and I know that some of you have been

293
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:09,320
 going through fiery trials, no matter how difficult, a Christian always has hope.

294
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,440
 Peter gave several reasons for this hopeful attitude.

295
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,760
 Number one, we have God's grace.

296
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,280
 Look again at what our speakers have told us each week.

297
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,720
 James said our salvation is because of his grace.

298
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,920
 He said he called us before we called on him.

299
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,440
 Johnny said we have tasted that the Lord is gracious, so we are not afraid of anything

300
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,480
 that he purposes for us.

301
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:51,660
 Michelle and Gabe said his grace is manifold and meets every situation in life.

302
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:58,600
 As we submit to him, he gives us all the grace that we need.

303
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,920
 In fact, verse 10, he is described as the God of all grace.

304
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:13,320
 He has the grace in every time of need and we must stand in that grace.

305
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,640
 This is the end of our series.

306
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:25,220
 And the end of our series moves from grace to glory.

307
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,820
 We know we are going to glory.

308
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:39,820
 He has in verse 10 said he has called us into his eternal glory by Christ Jesus.

309
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:50,100
 James in week one told us this is the wonderful inheritance into which we were born.

310
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:59,180
 My friends, whatever begins with God's grace will always lead to God's glory.

311
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,180
 Okay, let's say that again.

312
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:12,600
 Whatever begins with God's grace will always lead us to God's glory.

313
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:22,380
 If we depend on God's grace when we suffer, that suffering will result in glory.

314
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:24,260
 Remember this.

315
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,380
 The road may be difficult.

316
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:33,180
 It might look like the Red Sea, but it leads to glory.

317
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:37,700
 And that is all that really counts.

318
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:43,340
 Our present suffering is only for a while.

319
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,320
 Our various trials are only for a season.

320
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,820
 But the glory that results is eternal.

321
00:32:52,820 --> 00:33:00,460
 Secondly, we know that our trials are building Christian character.

322
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:09,500
 The Greek word translated makes you perfect means to equip, to adjust, to fit together.

323
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:16,020
 It is translated in Matthew 4.21 as mending nets.

324
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:23,500
 God has several tools that he uses to equip his people for life and service.

325
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,540
 And suffering is one of them.

326
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,900
 The word of God is another one too.

327
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:36,420
 He also uses the fellowship and the ministry of the church.

328
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:49,140
 Our Savior in heaven is perfecting his children so that they will do his will and his work.

329
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:55,140
 As I conclude the favorite word of my sermons, right?

330
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:06,020
 Peter uses three words to describe the kind of character that God wants us to have.

331
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:11,060
 Selfish means to fix firmly, to set fast.

332
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,020
 Christians must not be shaky or wobbly in their stand for Christ.

333
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:21,340
 Our hearts need to be established and this is accomplished by God's truth.

334
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:27,020
 The believer who is established will not be moved by persecution or led away by false

335
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,020
 doctrine.

336
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,180
 Secondly, strengthened means just that.

337
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,580
 God's strength given to us to meet the demands of life.

338
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:47,420
 What good is it to stand on a firm foundation if we don't have the power to act and settle

339
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:57,380
 is the translation of a word which means to lay a foundation.

340
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:03,380
 The house that was founded upon the rock withstood the storm.

341
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:11,300
 A believer who is equipped by God will continue in the faith grounded and settled.

342
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,260
 Colossians 1 tells us that.

343
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,940
 He will not be tossed to and fro and carried by every wind of doctrine.

344
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:26,300
 When an unbeliever goes through suffering, he loses his hope.

345
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:34,020
 But for a believer, suffering only increases his hope.

346
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,900
 Romans 5, I love this.

347
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:48,620
 Not only so, but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering brings perseverance.

348
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:55,140
 Perseverance, character and character, hope.

349
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,380
 Let me read that again.

350
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:05,460
 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings perseverance

351
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:15,180
 and perseverance, character and character, hope.

352
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:24,820
 God builds character and brightens hope when a believer trusts in him and depends on his

353
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,940
 grace.

354
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:35,460
 The result is that God receives the glory forever and ever.

355
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:44,500
 So a reminder, be humble, be watchful, be hopeful.

356
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,620
 Now Paul always ended his letters with a benediction of grace.

357
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:54,980
 Peter closed this epistle with a benediction of peace.

358
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,780
 He said, "Greet one another with a kiss of love."

359
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,140
 I wish I was there to be able to do that for you.

360
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:04,220
 Greet one another with a kiss of love.

361
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,820
 Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus.

362
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,740
 Amen.

363
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:16,900
 Peter opened his letter with a greeting of peace in 1 Peter 1 verse 2.

364
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:23,700
 And so the entire epistle points to God's peace from beginning to end.

365
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:32,380
 What a wonderful way to end a letter that announced the coming of a fiery trial.

366
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:40,300
 The church today is facing a fiery trial and we must be prepared.

367
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:45,380
 Remember the Red Sea.

368
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:59,460
 But whatever may come, Peter is still saying to each one of us, be hopeful, the glory is

369
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,500
 soon to come.

370
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:11,660
 We're going to finish the series as we started the series by singing that song, "Living Hope."

371
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:19,340
 I want you to look at every word as you sing this, as we conclude our series.

372
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,540
 And then Michelle will pray for us.

373
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,300
 Amen.

374
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:33,300
