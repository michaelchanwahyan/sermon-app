[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   Good morning, how's everybody doing?
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.680]   We are starting a new sermon series
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.040]   and it is on true joy.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.800]   What is true joy?
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.440]   The Book of Philippians.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.360]   The Book of Philippians.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.280]   Joy.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.760]   How many times did Paul talk about joy
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.840]   in the Book of Philippians?
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.320]   How many times?
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.680]   Huh, see?
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.160]   1,000, wow!
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.080]   I don't know if there's 1,000 words in the whole book.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.440]   66, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.280]   (woman speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.600]   16 times Paul talks about joy.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.480]   Why does he mention joy?
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.240]   Because he's very joyful, obviously.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.800]   Let's go to the next slide.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.680]   Different aspects of joy.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.960]   The joy of community, having joy in difficult times.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.080]   Who wants joy in difficult times?
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.360]   Having the mentality of joy, the joy of obedience,
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.760]   the goal of joy, and the practice of joy.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:42.880]   Okay, very good.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.120]   Let's take a minute just to prepare our heart
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.000]   and really focus on the Lord today.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.880]   Give the Lord our best today.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.000]   Let's take a moment to pray for ourselves.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.880]   Prepare our heart.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.680]   Dear Lord, as we go into your word today,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.360]   may you bless us and may you lead us by your Holy Spirit.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.120]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.240]   Dear, dear sir, Mr. Lai.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Sam, say it.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.520]   (laughing)
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.280]   Elias.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.320]   Okay.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.200]   Okay, next slide.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.960]   Any email?
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.480]   60AD, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:28.600]   Message in a--
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.280]   Oh, card.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.880]   Oh, I'm looking forward to your card.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.640]   (laughing)
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.480]   Very good, man.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.160]   Okay, very good.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.920]   No Snapchat?
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.160]   Oh, here, I'm Paul, I'm in Rome.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.000]   (laughing)
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.080]   Let me take next slide.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.160]   Dear Church of Philippi.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.640]   Okay, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.520]   The Church of Philippi, the leaders and deacons.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.360]   Oh, I hope you're doing well.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.400]   May God's grace and peace with you.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.640]   Without God's grace.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.480]   We need grace, God's grace in our life.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   God's grace is having his love that we don't deserve,
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.880]   his presence, his blessings that we don't deserve,
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.360]   and then we can experience his peace.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.760]   I am servants of God.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.360]   I am servants of God.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.640]   Not end the letter, end the email.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.840]   Introduce the email.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.240]   Okay, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.920]   Where is Philippi?
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.200]   Modern day Philippi (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.920]   It is in Greece.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.880]   Let's look at the next slide.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.960]   It is in modern day Greece.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.480]   Yeah, good.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.480]   Athens, Athens is nice.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.480]   It can be very hot though in the summer.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.520]   Modern day Greece.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:23.160]   He was like, oh, I wanna go to modern day Turkey,
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.280]   share the gospel.
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.560]   Modern day Turkey.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.080]   Turkey is beautiful, you should go to Turkey.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:56.400]   Anybody remember their dream?
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.160]   He had a vision of a man from Macedonia,
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.120]   which is from Greek, okay?
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:15.800]   And so he went to Macedonia to modern day Philippi.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.080]   I had a dream.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.280]   I had a dream that I was selling some of my shoes
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.400]   and I had a nightmare.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.240]   (laughing)
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.200]   I want my shoe back, I don't care about the money.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.440]   (laughing)
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:45.800]   Like the thunder, he followed the thunder
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.680]   to go to Macedonia, to Philippi.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.000]   Gold mines, anybody invest in gold?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.200]   Yeah, invest in gold.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   I'm joking.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.720]   (laughing)
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.920]   You should invest in gold.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.120]   When, okay, you invest in gold.
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.040]   It was known for its gold mines.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.000]   Also, it was known for the battle of Philippi.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.480]   So Caesar, do you know Caesar was assassinated?
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.320]   By who?
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:25.080]   It was his own cabinet, his own Senate, okay?
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.160]   And then they escaped to Philippi
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.040]   and then I think it was Octavian and Mark Anthony
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.960]   who defeat them and that was in the battle of Philippi
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.680]   and so that is what Philippi was known for.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.640]   It was also known for the birthplace of Christianity.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.840]   And then it was also a popular place
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.080]   for people to stay for the trade route.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.800]   The Silk Road towards Rome, okay?
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.080]   So imagine, you would stay here to bring the goods to Rome
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.520]   and then it was known for a Roman colony.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.160]   It was a Roman colony.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.760]   People in Philippian church.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.120]   Nathan.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.560]   Okay, the first thing that Paul says
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.640]   is that he is thanking God for them.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:15.720]   It's filled with joy.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.240]   His prayer is filled with joy.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.840]   He's in Rome.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:43.880]   On the same chains.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.520]   You know who he's chained with?
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.640]   He's chained with a Roman guard.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.120]   A Roman guard.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:12.000]   He's awaiting his trial and possible execution.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:26.600]   No, it's in a dark, next slide.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.000]   It's in a dark, rocky pit.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.160]   Next slide, next slide.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.960]   Yes, like this, dark, rocky pit.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.720]   There's probably mold growing in it, right?
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.080]   Like your room.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.920]   And.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.720]   (laughing)
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.240]   Chained to a Roman guard.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.680]   Why is he joyful?
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.760]   Because of the partnership of this church in Philippi.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.280]   Of this church in Philippi.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.760]   And he says that they have been partnering with him
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.120]   from the first day of the gospel.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.600]   Let's look at the next slide.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.200]   The joy of community.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.000]   The joy of community.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.360]   The one before, the one before.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   The joy of community.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.400]   The one with the girl.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.000]   The joy of community.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   The seller of purple cloth.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.520]   Yes, the rulers or the kings.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.480]   'Cause it is the symbol of wealth and prosperity.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:27.000]   (laughing)
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:48.760]   Imagine.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.440]   Victoria Harper, TST.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:01.960]   Meet the owner or the head of LV or something.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.760]   Gucci, Cartier, I don't know.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:14.520]   That is what it was like.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.720]   The seller of purple cloth.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.200]   From that first day, she and her family
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.360]   partnered with him to help start the church.
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:32.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:40.560]   It's like the sound of thunder.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.240]   There were two jail prison guard.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:53.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.080]   The prisoners will leave.
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.000]   And then the jailer wanted to kill himself
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.680]   because he would face the death punishment
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.760]   if anything happened and the prisoners left.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.640]   So he was ready to kill himself.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.520]   Him and his household believed in Jesus
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.520]   and they joined the church together.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:34.120]   It was very hard, very difficult.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:38.880]   Very difficult.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.960]   Same situation, same same.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.200]   (laughing)
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:56.320]   Jailer, Lydia partnered with them in the gospel.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.880]   It says in 2 Corinthians,
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.920]   when I was present with you and in need,
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.280]   I was a burden to no one for what I lacked,
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.160]   the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.280]   And it says in the next verse, 2 Corinthians 8,
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.200]   for I bear witness that according to their ability,
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.120]   yes, beyond their ability,
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.520]   they were willing to freely give,
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.240]   imploring us with much urgency
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.680]   that we would receive the gift and fellowship
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.960]   of ministering to the saints.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   The church in Philippi sent money to Paul and Timothy
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.720]   to support his ministry.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:04.960]   Congratulations.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.320]   Wow, very good partnership.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.840]   And my support, encouragement.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.360]   Encouragement from the church of Philippi.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.200]   Philippi.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.000]   What is joy?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:32.560]   Joy comes from the fruit of the spirit.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.240]   Right, the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace,
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.520]   patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness,
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.360]   and self-control.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:48.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.080]   It is a gift and a fruit of the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.400]   Joy is despite our circumstances.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:01.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.800]   Filled with joy because we trust
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.200]   that God has the best plan.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.240]   And our focus, because we have joy, is not on us.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.640]   It is on God.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.560]   God is the one that will provide.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.880]   God will get us, lead us according to his will.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.280]   Whether I'm in jail or I'm sharing the gospel elsewhere,
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.680]   I am joyful.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.120]   Before Caesar, it doesn't matter.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:44.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.800]   Stone Stephen to death.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:13.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:24.600]   No, he was full of anger.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.680]   He was full of anger.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.680]   He thought he was doing something for God.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.120]   He wasn't full of joy.
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.560]   Now he's full of joy.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.400]   Why?
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.960]   Because God changed him.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.120]   Jesus changed him.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.080]   On the road of Damascus,
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.160]   Jesus said, "Why are you persecuting me?
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.360]   "Why are you persecuting me?"
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:51.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.760]   From Saul to Paul, joy is having a state of security,
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.320]   being secure, a state of being.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.240]   I'm joyful because I believe God has called me
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.400]   to be his son and his daughter.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.320]   I am saved.
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.680]   I am joyful.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:24.000]   But it's temporary.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.280]   That is happiness.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.000]   But joy is knowing who we are in Jesus Christ.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And lastly, joy comes from a place of gratitude and prayer.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.200]   I am praying for you.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.240]   I'm so thankful for you.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.880]   So that is joy versus happiness.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.120]   He's gonna share some of his own story.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.440]   (audience applauding)
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.400]   Okay.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.320]   Ready, okay, all right.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.840]   Final year.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.520]   (speaking in foreign language)

[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.960]   (laughing)
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.560]   (laughing)
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:19.800]   (audience exclaiming)
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.400]   Achievement.
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:31.240]   (speaking in foreign language)

[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:36.880]   Joy.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.720]   (speaking in foreign language)

[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:06.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:32.400]   (audience applauding)
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.000]   Wow, great sharing.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Great sharing.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:45.960]   Do you think you are more happy or joyful?
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.840]   Do you think you are more happy or joyful?
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:27:01.200]   More happiness in their life, happiness.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:08.800]   Who thinks they experience more joy in their life?
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.640]   More joy, okay.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.480]   Okay.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.560]   Who thinks they experience more happiness in their life?
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.240]   It's okay, no judgment, no judgment.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.080]   Okay.
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:19.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.520]   Okay, we're gonna learn two more things.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:25.400]   The first thing that we learned is the joy of partnership.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.240]   Okay, the joy of partnership in the gospel.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.120]   When I was in University of Toronto,
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.640]   I joined a Christian group,
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.800]   and we held events to help people know Jesus.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.360]   We held a does God exist debate,
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.520]   and there was like 1,000 people,
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.320]   1,000 university students to join this debate,
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.520]   and it was so happy 'cause we saw students
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.800]   come to know Jesus through these events.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.520]   We were working together.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.360]   There was partnership.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.880]   Confidence in the faithful work of God.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.680]   And the third thing is praying
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.400]   for the spiritual growth of others.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.240]   Okay.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.760]   Confidence in the faithful work of God.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.320]   Paul says here, and I am sure of this,
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.640]   that he who began a good work in you
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.640]   will bring it into completion at the day of Jesus Christ.
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.640]   Yes, so that God will continue to work
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.200]   in the lives of the people in the church of Philippi.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:40.200]   From them, even though he may die,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.160]   God will continue to do its work,
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.240]   and that is his joy, right?
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.320]   'Cause Paul says, I have fought the good fight.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.120]   I've finished the race, and I have kept the faith.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   His joy is that he has done the best he can
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.680]   to help these people to know Jesus.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.120]   There's this word called discipleship.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.800]   Discipleship.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.160]   And it says here that the things you've heard me say
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.080]   in the presence of many witnesses,
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.000]   entrust them to people who are qualified
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.920]   to also teach others.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.680]   Timothy.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.840]   Disciple who?
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.240]   Faithful men and women who can also do what?
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.960]   Disciple others who are also reliable people.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.200]   So why is Paul filled with joy?
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.800]   Because he has started the discipleship process.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.760]   He's built into people in the church of Philippi
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:44.280]   like the jailer, like Lydia, and he's built into Timothy,
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.560]   and he believes that even though he may die,
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:51.120]   God will continue the work of discipleship
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.640]   in the church of Philippi and towards the ends of the earth.
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.480]   What he started in Timothy,
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.920]   he will carry it into faithful people
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.720]   who will also carry it into others.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:07.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:17.240]   I was a student intern.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.400]   No, no, no, not 1916.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:35.760]   Okay, I was here since 2016, all right?
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.080]   2017, all right?
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.440]   Who was here in 2016?
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.120]   Who was here?
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.280]   Vian was here, yeah, all right?
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.840]   It's been a joy to see you grow
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.960]   in your relationship with God.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.680]   Next slide, we went to Cambodia together, okay?
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:58.400]   Before all the kidnapping, right?
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.720]   (laughing)
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:01.120]   Before all the kidnappings,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.560]   the parents wouldn't let us go now.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.080]   Before all the kidnappings, we went to Cambodia.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:09.160]   We were sharing in the schools.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.520]   Sorry, I'm gonna speak English 'cause I can speak faster.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.160]   We have to end soon.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.080]   And we were sharing the gospel,
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.440]   and Vian was leading them in singing songs,
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.000]   and also Nathan was leading them
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.400]   in terms of the Bible story, right?
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.840]   It was a joy to see them grow.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.360]   Before, they were very shy,
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.480]   and they were like, "Oh, I don't know what to do.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.720]   "I'm in a foreign nation," right?
[00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.640]   But they stepped up.
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.640]   It was the joy of seeing people grow and serve God.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.720]   And then, you know, one month ago, where were we at?
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.240]   We were in camp, or July in camp, right?
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.360]   And it was a joy to see you guys counseling.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.760]   The older guys were helping mentor the younger ones.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.880]   It was a joy.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.080]   Next year, you gotta come.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.240]   The joy of seeing you guys as college people
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.800]   start to mentor others, and that is the joy.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.840]   The same joy Paul had,
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:15.360]   that he saw those who he was discipling
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.440]   start to mentor others.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:21.880]   How can we have joy in Explorer?
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.800]   That we start to build into others.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.960]   The pastors and mentors will build into the student leaders,
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.240]   and the student leaders build into the older ones,
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.120]   and the older ones build into the younger ones.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.360]   That is the joy of community,
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.760]   and that's what we want to see.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.160]   The last thing that Paul had joy in
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.160]   was the joy of praying for the spiritual growth of others.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:50.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:56.760]   Are you praying for them?
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.800]   And that is what Paul is praying for.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.160]   And this is my prayer,
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.840]   that your love may abound more and more
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.240]   with knowledge and discernment,
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.320]   so that you may approve what is excellent,
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:13.880]   to be pure and blameless for the day of Christ.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.520]   Pure and blameless.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.440]   Paul's prayer is that these Philippians
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:21.680]   would have love that abounds.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.000]   Overflowing, abound, overflowing.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.960]   That is what Paul wants of them,
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.200]   to have love that abounds, overflowing.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.400]   That's what Paul wants, that we pray for each other,
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.920]   that our love may abound.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.480]   If we love one another,
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.600]   we're gonna have joy automatically, automatically.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   Imagine everybody's love is abounding, overflowing.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.480]   How could this explore community not be joyful?
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:06.280]   The next quote says this,
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.040]   "Every great movement of God
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.160]   "can be traced to a kneeling figure."
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.200]   Every great movement can be traced to a kneeling figure.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.560]   As we pray for explorer, pray for the people beside us,
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.360]   we will start to see a movement,
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:26.280]   a movement of joy in our community.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:29.640]   Let's pray together for each other.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:31.240]   So three things.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:35.880]   Partnership in the gospel, serving one another.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:40.160]   Paul and Timothy are bond servants, servants of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:43.000]   We will have joy when we serve together
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.380]   and partner together.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:49.200]   Number two, we will have joy when we have confidence
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.360]   that God will continue to build into one another.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.760]   Discipleship, we will have joy
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.160]   when we build into one another.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:00.080]   Number three, we will have joy when we pray for each other,
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.780]   that God's love would abound more and more.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:09.200]   Are we an explorer praying for one another,
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.080]   that God's love would abound?
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.720]   An explorer, are we discipling,
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:19.240]   building into one another?
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.720]   We want to disciple you to know Jesus,
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.000]   to grow in your love for Jesus
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.440]   so that you can also build into others.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.640]   That's what we wanna do here in explorer.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.200]   Are you willing to be stipled?
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.820]   And number three, are you willing to serve one another?
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.760]   Coming to explore is not just,
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.520]   oh, I receive, I receive, I receive.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:46.480]   It is us giving to one another, giving to the Lord.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.840]   That is how we're gonna build a joyful community.
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.920]   It's not just sitting here, playing on your phone
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:55.520]   and hoping somebody does something for you.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:00.240]   We are not your, well, we are here to serve you, yes,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.440]   but we are here to serve one another as Jesus' example,
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.080]   to wash one another's feet.
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.080]   No, I'm joking.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.400]   Okay, and so that is our prayer.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:22.280]   We want to have a joyful community
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.240]   in this new season of explorer.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.800]   Let's build one another up.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.280]   Let's pray for one another.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   Let's serve one another so that God will be glorified.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.840]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.480]   Pray for our explorer community.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   And I'm gonna ask Winnie and Rita to come up.

[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.320]   that God would give us joy as we serve together,
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.760]   as we pray for one another,
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.880]   as we build each other up in community.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.920]   Let's pray to God.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.720]   Let's take one minute to pray,
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:10.720]   and then we will enter into a time of communion.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.400]   Lord, we pray for our community, explorer.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:18.060]   We want it to be filled with the joy of Jesus Christ.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:25.280]   We thank you for the passage from Philippians today.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.480]   Help us, Lord, to serve one another.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.200]   Help us to pray for one another.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.200]   And help us, Lord, to build each other up in Jesus Christ.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:38.920]   May you help us, Lord.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
