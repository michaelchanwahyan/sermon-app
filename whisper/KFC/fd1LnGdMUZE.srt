3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,600
Good morning, Explorers.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,440
Today's sermon asks a simple question.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,000
Are you a growing Christian?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Let me repeat that.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Are you a growing Christian?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,500
I want to start with a personal story.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,100
I've not always been a pastor.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,900
When I came to Hong Kong in 1987,

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,400
yes, I know it was before you were born,

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,400
except Pastor Johnny,

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,400
I was a businessman.

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,900
And you'll see a picture of me as a businessman.

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,900
In 1995,

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,900
I joined a church

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,900
that was called Repulse Bay Baptist Church.

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,900
The pastor, who was an Aussie,

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,900
was a good friend.

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,900
Now, there were two problems about that church.

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,900
Firstly, it wasn't in Repulse Bay.

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,900
And secondly, it wasn't a Baptist church.

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:24,900
The next problem is that the pastor left in 1996.

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,900
And we were left with a church with a silly name,

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,900
no pastor, about 40 people, and no money.

26
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:42,900
I remember preaching a sermon in December 1996

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,900
on John chapter 15,

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,900
the chapter where Jesus spoke about being the vine and us being the branches.

29
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,900
I remember it well.

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,900
I mentioned in this chapter

31
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,900
that this chapter called for a church that was Christ-centered,

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:09,900
abiding in Him, relationship-based, fruitful, and poured out.

33
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:17,900
You can see the analogy between the vine and church.

34
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,900
Anyway, we decided in January 1997,

35
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,900
as the church wasn't in Repulse Bay,

36
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,900
and it wasn't a Baptist church,

37
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,900
to change its name.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,900
And given my sermon weeks before,

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,900
the name "The Vine" was chosen.

40
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,900
Little did I know then

41
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,900
that I would become its first senior pastor.

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,900
The rest, as they say, is history.

43
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,900
And for the past five years,

44
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,900
I've been honored to be part of the team here at KFC.

45
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,900
And it is my honor to speak to explorers,

46
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,900
as I have a heart for the future generation.

47
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,900
At the beginning, I asked a simple question.

48
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,900
Are you a growing Christian?

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,900
Now, if I offered you a measuring device

50
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,900
designed to measure spiritual growth in a believer's life,

51
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,900
what would you find?

52
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,900
Today, we have all sorts of fancy gadgets

53
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,900
that can measure just about anything.

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,900
For instance, they can measure our height, our weight,

55
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,900
including the amount of body fat that we have

56
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
versus the amount of muscle.

57
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,900
We can measure our cholesterol level,

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,900
our blood pressure, our sugar level,

59
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,900
and so many things.

60
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,900
We can diagnose everything about us physically,

61
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,900
but today I want to give you a tool

62
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,900
that can help you measure

63
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,900
how well you are doing spiritually.

64
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,900
In fact, I want to give you four spiritual tools

65
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,900
called disciplines

66
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,900
that can help you measure how you are doing spiritually.

67
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,900
Open your Bibles or your smartphones

68
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,900
to John's Gospel, chapter 15.

69
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,900
I'm going to read the first eight verses

70
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,900
of this wonderful, transforming chapter of God's Word,

71
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,900
the chapter that gave the church the name "Divine" 24 years ago.

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Let's start off with the first five verses.

73
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
This is Jesus speaking.

74
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,900
I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.

75
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,900
Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, He takes away,

76
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,900
and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes,

77
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,900
that it might bear more fruit.

78
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,900
Already you are clean because of the word I have spoken to you.

79
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,900
Abide in me.

80
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,900
And I in you.

81
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,900
As the branch cannot bear fruit by itselfunless it abides in the vine,

82
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,900
neither can you unless you abide in me.

83
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,900
I am the vine.

84
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,900
You are the branches.

85
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,900
Whoever abides in me, and I in him,

86
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,900
he it is that bears much fruit.

87
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,900
For apart from me, you can do nothing.

88
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,900
Our Lord Jesus Christ taught His disciples

89
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,900
that the key to spiritual growth is

90
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
Now get this, now get this.

91
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,900
The key to spiritual growth is abiding in Him.

92
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,900
He said in verse 5,

93
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:17,900
six words that can change the way you live your Christian life.

94
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Without me, you can do nothing.

95
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,900
Until you come to terms with the reality

96
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,900
of your need to abide daily with Christ,

97
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,900
you'll always be a yo-yo Christian,

98
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
up and down, up and down,

99
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,900
up one minute, down the next.

100
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,900
On fire for God one day,

101
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,900
and burned out the next.

102
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,900
I believe that many Christians today

103
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,900
can be found living in two extremes.

104
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,900
On one hand, there are those Christians

105
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,900
who are what I call active but empty.

106
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,900
And secondly, there are Christian church members today

107
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,900
who are apathetic and empty.

108
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,900
That's right.

109
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,900
I believe Christians who are in an all out sprint

110
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,900
can just be as empty in their lives

111
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,900
as Christians who are watching from the sidelines.

112
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,900
You see, we've lost our focus

113
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,900
on what it takes to be a growing believer.

114
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,900
We're engaged either in activity or passivity.

115
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:46,900
When what God truly wants is for us to be abiding.

116
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Abiding in Christ means to remain in,

117
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,900
to stay in, or even continue in

118
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,900
a constant continuing, committed, concentrated,

119
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,900
called out relationship with Jesus Christ as Lord.

120
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:13,900
So what are the tools or spiritual disciplines

121
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,900
we need to measure our Christian growth?

122
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Firstly, the spiritual discipline of abiding in the word.

123
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,900
John 15,7.

124
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
Look at John 15,7.

125
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Jesus said, "If you abide in me,

126
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,900
and my words abide in you."

127
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,900
Stop reading right there.

128
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,900
Jesus is telling us

129
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,900
if we want to be a growing believer,

130
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,900
a disciple, we must abide in his word.

131
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,900
In John chapter 8, verses 31 and 32,

132
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,900
the Bible tells us.

133
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,900
So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him,

134
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,900
"If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,

135
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
and you will know the truth,

136
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,900
and the truth will set you free."

137
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,900
The way to have Christ living in us

138
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,900
is to have the word in us.

139
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,900
The word is food to us.

140
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,900
Matthew 4,4 says this,

141
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,900
"But he answered, 'It is written,

142
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,900
"Man shall not live by bread alone,

143
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,900
but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."

144
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,900
And Romans 10,17 says,

145
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,900
"So faith comes by hearing,

146
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,900
and hearing through the word of God."

147
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,900
Those words, "Faith comes by hearing,"

148
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,900
are really special to us here at Confluct Church.

149
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
We're currently part of the ONE campaign,

150
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
which is happening all around the world.

151
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,900
I found out this week that 183 countries around the world

152
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,900
are taking part in the ONE campaign,

153
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,900
and there's only 195 countries in the world.

154
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
And we have a vision, don't we,

155
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,900
to take the gospel to the whole world by 2033,

156
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,900
that the gospel will be available in every language,

157
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
and we are part of that.

158
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Now we receive the word in many ways.

159
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,900
Number one, listening to the word of God taught or preached.

160
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,900
I hope you're hearing the voice of God this morning.

161
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,900
Secondly, reading the word of God,

162
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,900
including orally listening to the word of God.

163
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,900
Number three, studying the word of God.

164
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,900
Number four, memorizing the word of God.

165
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Number five, meditating on the word of God.

166
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,900
And number six, and probably most importantly,

167
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,900
applying the word of God to our lives.

168
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,900
Now notice I've done something on the slides

169
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,900
to help you and understand,

170
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,900
remember these four spiritual disciplines

171
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
necessary to grow as a believer.

172
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,900
I have presented the first discipline

173
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,900
in the lower vertical portion of the cross.

174
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,900
That indicates just how we are to abide in Christ,

175
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,900
by abiding in his word here on earth.

176
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,900
His word enables us to live for Christ effectively.

177
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
Psalm 119 says,

178
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,900
I have stored your word in my heart

179
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,900
that I might not sin against you.

180
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Other versions say,

181
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,900
I have hidden your word in my heart.

182
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,900
How are you doing?

183
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,900
Do you love God's word?

184
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Do you read it?

185
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Do you study it?

186
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
Memorize it?

187
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Do you live it?

188
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Do you obey God's word?

189
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Abiding in God's word

190
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
means we live the word

191
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
as much as we read the word.

192
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,900
God's word has the power

193
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,900
to transform your life.

194
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Its teachings will radically change

195
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
your thinking and thus,

196
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,900
your lifestyle.

197
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Number two,

198
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,900
the spiritual discipline

199
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,900
of praying in the faith.

200
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Again, verse 7,

201
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,900
if you abide in me and my words abide in you,

202
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,900
you will ask what you desire

203
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:34,900
and it shall be done for you.

204
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
Another important discipline

205
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
necessary for Christian growth

206
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,900
is praying in faith.

207
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Look again at verse 7.

208
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,900
And this time,

209
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,900
let's read the whole verse.

210
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
If you abide in me,

211
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,900
my words abide with you,

212
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,900
you will ask what you desire

213
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,900
and it shall be done for you.

214
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
A growing Christian

215
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,900
should have or should be developing

216
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,900
and maintaining a lifestyle of praying.

217
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,900
So how do we pray?

218
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Matthew chapter 6.

219
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Jesus said,

220
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,900
when you pray,

221
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:12,900
by the way,

222
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,900
he didn't say if you pray.

223
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
He said,

224
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,900
when you pray,

225
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
don't be like the hypocrite

226
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
who love to pray publicly

227
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
on street corners

228
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
and in the synagogue

229
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,900
where everyone can see them.

230
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
I assure you,

231
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
that is all the reward

232
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,900
they will ever get.

233
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,900
But when you pray,

234
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
go away by yourself,

235
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,900
shut the door behind you

236
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,900
and pray to your Father

237
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,900
secretly.

238
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Then your Father

239
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,900
who knows all secrets

240
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
will reward you.

241
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,900
I got six observations.

242
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Number one,

243
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
Jesus assumes that

244
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,900
as his children,

245
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
we will pray.

246
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,900
When you pray,

247
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
as I said.

248
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
Secondly,

249
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
pray to God the Father,

250
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,900
not to be heard of men.

251
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Number three,

252
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
have a private

253
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,900
place of prayer.

254
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Some of us call it

255
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
a prayer closet.

256
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Number four,

257
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
be consistent.

258
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Number five,

259
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
keep a prayer journal.

260
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
And then when the prayers

261
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
are answered,

262
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
you can tick them off.

263
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
And number six is

264
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
follow a pattern of prayer.

265
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
And there are different

266
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
patterns of prayer.

267
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
You can pray according

268
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
to the Lord prayer.

269
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Our Father in heaven,

270
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Hallowed be your name,

271
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,900
etc.

272
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Or you can pray

273
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
according to

274
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,900
what I call acts.

275
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
ACTS.

276
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,900
I put them on the screen.

277
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
Adoration,

278
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
confession,

279
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
thanksgiving,

280
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,900
supplication.

281
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
That's a long word

282
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
that basically means asking.

283
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Now notice the upper

284
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
vertical portion of the cross

285
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,900
points upward to heaven or God

286
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,900
and indicates the way

287
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,900
we communicate with God

288
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,900
through prayer and faith.

289
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,900
Number three,

290
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
you still with me?

291
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Good.

292
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,900
The spiritual discipline

293
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,900
of fellowshipping with believers.

294
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,900
Fellowshipping,

295
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,900
and I know it's difficult

296
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,900
in this Zoom period.

297
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,900
It refers to the special relationship

298
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,900
we share with all other believers.

299
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
All true Christians

300
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,900
have a fellowship,

301
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,900
a true partnership

302
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
with other believers.

303
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Our mutual faith

304
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
in Christ builds a bond

305
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
of communion and commitment

306
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
with one another.

307
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,900
We need one another.

308
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,900
We are a family.

309
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,900
You are my brothers and sisters.

310
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Abiding in Christ

311
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,900
means we will seek to live

312
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
in fellowship with our brothers

313
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
and sisters in Christ.

314
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,900
John 13 says this,

315
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,900
A new commandment I give you,

316
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
that you love one another

317
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
just as I have loved you.

318
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
You are to love one another.

319
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,900
By this all men will know

320
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
that you are my disciples

321
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,900
if you have love for one another.

322
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,900
God has provided a home

323
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
for his children.

324
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
It's called the church.

325
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,900
He has provided explorers.

326
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,900
He has even given us the T-shirt.

327
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,900
The church is the place

328
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,900
where relationships are nurtured,

329
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,900
where love is expressed,

330
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
compassion shared,

331
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,900
encouragement given

332
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
and acceptance offered.

333
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,900
It is the beginning point of ministry.

334
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
It is the body of Christ

335
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,900
here on earth,

336
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,900
a living, growing body.

337
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,900
If you are to abide in Christ,

338
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
you must abide in his church.

339
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
You will never find

340
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
a well-balanced Christian

341
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,900
who is not involved in the church

342
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,900
of Lord Jesus Christ somewhere.

343
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,900
Now notice the word fellowship

344
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,900
is written on the right side

345
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,900
of the horizontal portion of the cross.

346
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,900
The horizontal part of the cross

347
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,900
represents the important relationship

348
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,900
we Christians are to have with others.

349
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Just as the vertical part of the cross

350
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
points to our relationship with God,

351
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
so the horizontal part

352
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,900
indicates the importance

353
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
of our relationship with others

354
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,900
if we are to be growing disciples.

355
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,900
Not only are we to have relationship

356
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,900
with other believers through the church

357
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,900
called fellowship,

358
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,900
but we are also to have a relationship

359
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,900
with unbelievers in the world

360
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,900
and that's called witnessing.

361
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,900
That leads me to my last point.

362
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
Number four,

363
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
the spiritual discipline

364
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,900
of witnessing to the world.

365
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
Verse 8.

366
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,900
By this my father is glorified

367
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,900
that you bear much fruit

368
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,900
so you will be my disciples.

369
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Jesus said that the way

370
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
to show that we are disciples

371
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
is to bear much fruit.

372
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,900
That's why I loved

373
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,900
the picture of the grapes.

374
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,900
Witnessing is the natural outgoing,

375
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,900
is the natural outgrowth

376
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,900
of the abiding and growing Christian life.

377
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,900
If we are to live in his word,

378
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
pray in faith,

379
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
and fellowship with believers,

380
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
it will be natural and normal

381
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,900
to share with others

382
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,900
what Christ is doing in our lives.

383
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
In fact,

384
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
you won't be able to help

385
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,900
but share or witness to those around you.

386
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Bearing fruit is more than witnessing,

387
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,900
but it always involves witnessing.

388
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Jesus said to his first disciples

389
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
who were all fishermen,

390
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,900
I will make you fishers of men.

391
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Jesus also said,

392
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,900
you shall be my witnesses.

393
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,900
Are you a witness for Christ?

394
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,900
Now notice once again

395
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,900
that the first two spiritual disciplines

396
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,900
deal with our relationship to God.

397
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,900
That relationship is represented

398
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
by a vertical relationship.

399
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
When we hear the word,

400
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,900
God speaks to us.

401
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,900
When we pray,

402
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
we speak to God.

403
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,900
The last two spiritual disciplines

404
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,900
deal with our relationship to fellow men.

405
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
This is a horizontal relationship

406
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
between a believer,

407
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
the church and the world.

408
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
When we faithfully attend church

409
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,900
with other believers,

410
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
when we are faithful to share Christ

411
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
with the lost,

412
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,900
then we are witnessing to the world.

413
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,900
If you truly desire

414
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,900
to develop a close growing relationship

415
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
with Christ,

416
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,900
then learn to put into spiritual practice

417
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
the disciplines of,

418
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,900
number one, living in the word,

419
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
Bible study.

420
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,900
Number two, praying in faith,

421
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
prayer.

422
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Number three,

423
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,900
fellowshipping with believers,

424
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,900
faithful, consistent, regular attendance

425
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900
in God's church,

426
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
even if it's online.

427
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
And lastly,

428
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
witnessing to the world,

429
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,900
sharing your faith with others.

430
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,900
I want to give you a word of warning,

431
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
however.

432
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,900
As important as these activities may be,

433
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,900
they are not what Jesus says

434
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
makes you a Christian.

435
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,900
You can read the Bible from cover to cover.

436
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,900
You can go to church every week

437
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
for the rest of your life,

438
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,900
and it won't guarantee

439
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,900
a healthy relationship with God.

440
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,900
Jesus is open in words

441
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,900
to his disciples with ease.

442
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,900
Follow me.

443
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,900
He described as Christian

444
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,900
people when he said,

445
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,900
my people recognize my voice.

446
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,900
I know them,

447
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,900
and they follow.

448
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,900
The essence of being a Christian for Jesus

449
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,900
was to hear and to heed the voice of God.

450
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
The process involved

451
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
taking up your own cross,

452
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,900
denying yourself,

453
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,900
and losing your life

454
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,900
in order to find it.

455
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,900
I've got a new word for you.

456
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Followship.

457
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,900
The process of followship

458
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,900
didn't look the same for everyone.

459
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
What Jesus said to the apostle Peter

460
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,900
was different from what he said

461
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
to the apostle John.

462
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,900
But as the disciples

463
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
responded to Jesus' word,

464
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
they got to know God

465
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
and his kingdom ways.

466
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,900
The key to your growth

467
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,900
is to get to know God

468
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
and his kingdom ways.

469
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,900
And I want to pray for you right now.

470
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,900
Before I pray for you,

471
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,900
I do realize that there might be

472
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,900
people watching

473
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
for whom measuring

474
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
your spiritual discipline

475
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
cannot be done.

476
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
Just as I cannot measure

477
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
my fitness levels without

478
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,900
my steps without a Fitbit

479
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
or a smartphone,

480
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
you cannot begin to measure

481
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,900
your spiritual fitness

482
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,900
without being attached

483
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,900
to the true vine,

484
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
Jesus Christ.

485
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
You don't have yet

486
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,900
a personal relationship

487
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
with Jesus Christ.

488
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,900
He is not your Lord and Savior.

489
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,900
Yet.

490
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
I say yet.

491
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,900
I want to challenge you.

492
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,900
You need to come before the cross.

493
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,900
The cross that you see on the slide.

494
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Look at it.

495
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Confess the things that you've done wrong

496
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,900
and your need for forgiveness.

497
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,900
Receive him.

498
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,900
And choose to follow him.

499
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,900
Can I ask everyone,

500
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,900
wherever you are,

501
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,900
just to close your eyes for a moment.

502
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,900
And I want to give anybody

503
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,900
who's watching online

504
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,900
that opportunity

505
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,900
to come to the cross,

506
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,900
to confess your sins,

507
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,900
to ask for forgiveness

508
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,900
and ask Jesus

509
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
to become your personal Savior.

510
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,900
I'm not talking about your friend here,

511
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,900
your brother or your sister.

512
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,900
I'm talking about you.

513
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,900
If you haven't taken that step yet,

514
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,900
would you pray this prayer with me?

515
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Dear Heavenly Father,

516
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,900
I come before you now

517
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,900
and I recognize

518
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,900
my need of your Son, Jesus Christ.

519
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,900
I believe Jesus Christ.

520
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,900
You went to the cross for me

521
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
and you died for my sins.

522
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
I confess.

523
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
I have done things wrong.

524
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,900
In thought, word and deed.

525
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,900
I need your forgiveness.

526
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,900
Today, I come to your cross.

527
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,900
I ask for your forgiveness.

528
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
I ask you to come into my life

529
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
and fill me with your Spirit.

530
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Lord Jesus,

531
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,900
I receive your free gift of eternal life.

532
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,900
I am yours

533
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,900
and I will be

534
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,900
forever and ever.

535
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
Amen.

536
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,900
And if you prayed that prayer,

537
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,900
please tell someone.

538
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Either go on the chat line

539
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,900
or tell your Explorers leaders.

540
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,900
Tell someone that you prayed this prayer.

541
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,900
I'm not finished yet.

542
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,900
I want to pray for all of us.

543
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,900
This area of spiritual growth is not an easy area.

544
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,900
We're all faced with the compromises of the world.

545
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,900
We're faced at the moment with COVID.

546
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,900
Before that, we were faced with the political situation.

547
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,900
It is not easy

548
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,900
to grow as a Christian.

549
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,900
I want to pray for you now.

550
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,900
I want you to go back on this talk.

551
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
Maybe listen to it again.

552
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
Take down the notes from the slides.

553
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,900
I'll ask Carmen and leaders to send you copies of the slides.

554
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,900
And I want to pray for you

555
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,900
that you would grow as a believer.

556
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
Let's all pray together.

557
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Father God, I thank you for today.

558
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,900
I thank you that you've shown us

559
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,900
that Jesus is the true vine.

560
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,900
We are the branches.

561
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
And I thank you for these four ways

562
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,900
that you've shown us to grow in Him.

563
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,900
I pray, Lord, that you'd give us the discipline, the will.

564
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,900
Lord, that you'd make the time available for us

565
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,900
that maybe we turn off Netflix for a moment

566
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:03,900
and look in your word, seek your face.

567
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,900
And I pray, Lord, that you'd raise us up.

568
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,900
Lord, not as believers, but as the true disciples.

569
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
And I pray that everyone who is online this morning

570
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,900
will grow into a true disciple of Jesus Christ.

571
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,900
Amen.

572
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,900
Thank you for listening to me.

573
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
I hope it's not too long

574
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,900
before I get a chance to speak to you again.

575
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,900
God bless you, Explorers.

576
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,900
