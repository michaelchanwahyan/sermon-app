1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 I feel quite emotional about that.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,240
 Michelle was right, Hong Kong is our home.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:19,000
 I do feel we've had words of prophecy over us that actually we're going to go to be ambassadors

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,840
 for Hong Kong.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:26,000
 A lot of people are talking a lot of nonsense about Hong Kong and everyone sort of saying,

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,400
 "When are you leaving?"

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,800
 I feel that God has ordained us for this season to go overseas and really be ambassadors for

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
 Hong Kong.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,640
 So please keep us in your prayers and we will keep you in our prayers definitely.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,440
 Well, we reached the end of our journey today.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:54,480
 Ten weeks of self-examination, ten weeks of practicing not giving the enemy a seat at

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,120
 your table.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,640
 To be honest with you, I'm going to miss it.

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,920
 I'm going to give you an LOL moment though.

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,360
 Bonnie is not going to miss having to set up the table with Taobao fruit every week.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:15,560
 But I just want to give a great thanks to Bonnie for week after week after week.

17
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,320
 I think she said to me on week two, "We don't need to do the fruit in the table anymore."

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
 I said, "Yes, we do."

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,920
 And she's done it faithfully every week.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,720
 Thank you so much.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,400
 But maybe today is not the end.

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,800
 Actually today is the beginning of our journey.

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:43,040
 I'm going to focus on some key biblical truths and I'm going to give you some seeds.

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,000
 We are going to together, we're going to plant something today.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,420
 And I'm going to share an exercise where every day this week, you will share with yourself

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,220
 and hopefully with others a biblical truth.

27
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,080
 And I'm going to encourage you to learn some memory verses.

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,200
 Do you remember that when you were at Sunday school?

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:15,480
 Now question, why do kids learn memory verses at Sunday school and we don't as adults, right?

30
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,020
 We've got out the habit of it.

31
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,920
 Maybe we need to restore the habit.

32
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,600
 I used to love doing, send them to song.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,800
 You sang a song and then you actually learned the Bible verse.

34
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,280
 And we had a singer in the UK, James may have heard of him, called Ishmael.

35
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,000
 His name was actually Ian Smale, but he called himself Ishmael.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,840
 And all he did was take scripture verses and put them to song.

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,480
 And he had one, it just went like this.

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,480
 The song went like this.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,840
 Hebrews 11 verse six, "Without faith it's impossible to please God."

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,480
 That was the end of the song.

41
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,120
 But you know, it may not have been a great song, but I've never forgotten since that

42
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,140
 time what Hebrews 11 verse six.

43
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,000
 And for those of you who are Sunday school teachers, who are teaching kids memory verses,

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 keep on doing it.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,560
 And for us as adults, can we start doing it?

46
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,680
 Can I have amen to that?

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:21,480
 I believe that my seven seeds for seven days will grow into a beautiful garden.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,360
 It will change our flawed mindset that has enabled the enemy to gain a seat at our table

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,920
 into a mindset that leads to life.

50
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:40,200
 Now to enable us to do this, I need to ask us all a telling question.

51
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,240
 And we need to be honest with ourselves with the answer.

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,040
 Are you stuck?

53
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,360
 Are you stuck with a thought or an attitude?

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,200
 Somehow you can't get it out of your mind.

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,740
 Are you stuck with a faulty concept of who you are?

56
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:04,880
 Are you still stuck with a gripping temptation that you can't seem to break free from?

57
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:11,080
 You know what God wants from you, yet you know it's difficult to get your mind off the

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,720
 path that leads to less than God's best plan for your life.

59
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,120
 Now here is the brutal truth.

60
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:27,620
 The battle for your life is fought and won in your mind.

61
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,480
 God wants you to take control of your life in Jesus' name through the power of the Holy

62
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,400
 Spirit.

63
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,200
 And it's actually down to having a right thinking.

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,920
 That's what this series has all been about.

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:54,560
 And because God is in the story with us, we are ultimately in a story of victory.

66
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:03,680
 Yet we can still be tripped up and sidetracked along the way.

67
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:13,960
 We can give the enemy a seat at our table, but we don't need to.

68
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:20,440
 Romans 8 verse 6 gives a great summary of how we don't need to let the enemy sit down.

69
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,480
 I'm reading this one from the NASB.

70
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:40,240
 It says this, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is

71
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,160
 life and peace."

72
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,080
 I love the imagery of a mindset.

73
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,920
 We can have a new mindset, a new way of thinking, and I wanna answer the important question

74
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,360
 how?

75
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:07,280
 But first, are you ready for a new mindset?

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,440
 I want to show you a mindset that leads to life.

77
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,280
 You can see it on the screen.

78
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,800
 I wanna show you that your mindset can be different.

79
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,400
 Your thoughts can be different, and your life can be different because your mind is set

80
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,320
 on Christ.

81
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,520
 God is with you.

82
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,680
 He is on your side.

83
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,080
 He has established a beachhead of victory through Christ.

84
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:46,000
 But we have to play our part.

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,320
 The way you go about stopping the enemy from sitting at your table is by winning the battle

86
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,360
 for your mind.

87
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:05,440
 It means replacing old harmful thoughts with new life-giving thoughts, and new life-giving

88
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,280
 thoughts will lead to changed behavior.

89
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,160
 Victory begins in the mind.

90
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,200
 Now one way of thinking less about the devil or the evil that you are trying to avoid and

91
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:32,400
 thinking more about God and the truth you're aiming to embrace is by memorizing Scripture.

92
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,400
 Imagine your mind is a garden.

93
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:45,680
 Seeds can be dropped by birds or float in the wind, but you as the gardener are responsible

94
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,760
 for what grows there.

95
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:56,880
 You have the power to water good seeds, to cultivate the good seeds, and pull out the

96
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,740
 weeds from the seeds you don't want growing there.

97
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,720
 But how?

98
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:20,080
 Look at Romans 12.2.

99
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,680
 Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is.

100
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,400
 His good, pleasing, and perfect will.

101
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,720
 Actually what Paul is saying here is you reap what you sow.

102
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:45,240
 If you sow negativity, fear, pride, unclean thoughts, I could go on, that is what you'll

103
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,480
 reap.

104
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,720
 Everybody, do yourself a favour.

105
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:56,880
 Go home tonight, switch on your computer and check your history.

106
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,800
 I dare you to do that.

107
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,280
 That is what you are sowing into your mind.

108
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:13,360
 Whose websites are you trusting your spiritual growth to?

109
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:21,540
 Think of who you hang out with, the company you keep, and their conversation.

110
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,040
 Is it uplifting?

111
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,860
 Or are they a bunch of complainers, cynics?

112
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:33,800
 Is their talk wholesome or is it leading you down a slippery slope?

113
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:42,120
 The way to renew your mind is to wrap your thoughts around Scripture.

114
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,500
 Full stop.

115
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,360
 You can take control of what you think about.

116
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,200
 Scripture helps you plant good seeds in your mind.

117
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,440
 As these seeds take root and grow, they will help you remove the destructive weeds that

118
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,000
 the enemy tries to plant on your mind.

119
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,520
 Now we get to the exciting bit.

120
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,120
 Seven seeds.

121
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,680
 I've called this the mindset that leads to life.

122
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,880
 Seven seeds for seven days.

123
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:25,480
 Number one, tell yourself the truth and number two, memorise the verse.

124
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:33,140
 And I'm suggesting that you take one thought and one verse per day.

125
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,800
 Or maybe you take one thought and one verse per week for seven weeks.

126
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:46,900
 Either way, plant and begin to cultivate these seven thoughts in your mind right now and

127
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,920
 personalise it for yourself.

128
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
 There's good news.

129
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,520
 You're going to be given a card.

130
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,560
 You will never forget this series.

131
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,040
 The yellow, right?

132
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,840
 You will be given a card that you'll be given during the final song at the end of the service.

133
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,020
 Take this with you.

134
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,560
 If you're listening online, we will post this online as well.

135
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,560
 And this could be so valuable for you.

136
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,900
 And if you need to take one for someone, if there's one over, take one.

137
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,600
 So what we're going to do is we're going to look at the next week.

138
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,920
 And firstly, we're going to look at Sunday, tomorrow.

139
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,760
 You get up tomorrow morning.

140
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,400
 The first thing I want you to do is to tell yourself a truth.

141
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,580
 And the truth is this, I am in God's story.

142
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,320
 Not too difficult, right?

143
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,160
 In fact, let's repeat that together.

144
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
 Ready?

145
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
 One, two, three.

146
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,880
 I am in God's story.

147
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,200
 Well, that's five of you.

148
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
 That's really good.

149
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
 No, it's fantastic.

150
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,840
 No, you did very well.

151
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,560
 The story of who you are is part of God's larger story.

152
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,960
 The story is bigger than you.

153
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,160
 Ultimately, the story is not about you.

154
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:14,000
 But you have been invited into the story of God's great glory and grace.

155
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,800
 It's all about Him.

156
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:26,080
 But you have a seat at His table.

157
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,960
 Before you were formed in your mother's womb, God knew you.

158
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,280
 Jesus, the good shepherd, guides you always.

159
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:44,800
 And according to Psalm 37, 23, the Lord makes firm the steps of those who delight in Him.

160
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,240
 So firstly, plant this thought in your mind.

161
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,800
 I am in God's story.

162
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,080
 And memorise this scripture.

163
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,140
 I think you'll be familiar to many of you.

164
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,680
 Let's read it together, shall we?

165
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
 Go to the next slide.

166
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,440
 Got it?

167
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,440
 The next one.

168
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
 That's it.

169
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
 Right, ready?

170
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,440
 Okay, all together.

171
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
 One, two, three.

172
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,840
 "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord.

173
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,440
 Plans to prosper you and not to harm you.

174
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,080
 Plans to give you a hope and a future.

175
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,120
 Not too difficult to memorise that one, right?

176
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,960
 I think most of you know it.

177
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,920
 Because you matter to God.

178
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,680
 But ultimate meaning will not come from putting the spotlight on you.

179
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,240
 Your life will have the greatest significance when you choose to make it about the one who

180
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,800
 welcomed you into His never-ending story.

181
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,920
 I know Mondays, a lot of us don't fancy getting up Monday morning, workday, right?

182
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,440
 Monday morning, the alarm goes off.

183
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,320
 Oh, it's too early.

184
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,840
 Okay, wake up Monday morning and tell yourself, "I am fearfully and wonderfully made."

185
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
 Can we try that one?

186
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,360
 One, two, three.

187
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,880
 I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

188
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,000
 Your birth was not a random act.

189
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,800
 God made you with intention and God made you wonderfully.

190
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:28,840
 Isaiah 43, one says, "God has redeemed you and knows your name."

191
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,120
 So plant this in your mind.

192
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,080
 I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

193
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:40,080
 You know, I think I told you a few weeks ago, my younger sister is 18 years older than me.

194
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:44,720
 And for many years, the family joke was, I was the family mistake, right?

195
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
 But I'm not.

196
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,160
 I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

197
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,440
 And memorize this scripture together.

198
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
 It's found in Psalm 139.

199
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,440
 Let's all read together.

200
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
 Yeah, good.

201
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
 One, two, three.

202
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,240
 "For you create my inmost being.

203
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,240
 You knit me together in my mother's womb.

204
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,640
 I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.

205
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,400
 Your works are wonderful.

206
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,640
 I know that full well."

207
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,320
 You're not the maker.

208
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,640
 You are made.

209
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,640
 God is not created in your image, how you think he should be.

210
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,360
 But you are created in his image.

211
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,720
 He decided that he wanted you in his universe.

212
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,000
 He imagined you and he fashioned you.

213
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,320
 You are not accidental, incidental.

214
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,080
 You are divinely crafted.

215
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:52,240
 Plant this seed every day and in time, you'll have an oak tree providing shade for you and

216
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,920
 those around you.

217
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:05,160
 You will begin to believe that you are who God says you are, unique, special, valuable.

218
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,080
 Okay, we guess better with Tuesday.

219
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
 It's getting better, right?

220
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
 So we have Monday out of the way.

221
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,080
 Tell yourself, "My life has purpose."

222
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
 Very easy, right?

223
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,080
 Four words.

224
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
 One, two, three.

225
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,080
 "My life has purpose."

226
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,080
 You were born for a noble reason.

227
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,080
 God has good things for you to do.

228
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,080
 He has called you to live for what matters.

229
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:39,080
 So plant this thought in your mind and memorise this scripture from Ephesians 2.

230
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,080
 One, two, three.

231
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:49,080
 "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared

232
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,080
 us in advance for us to do."

233
00:16:52,080 --> 00:17:00,080
 Random things are random, but created things have purpose.

234
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,080
 There is just one you.

235
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
 There's just one me.

236
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,080
 Thank goodness you say.

237
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,080
 You have a unique calling, a reason for being.

238
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:21,080
 Something to do in God's story that is important and needed.

239
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,080
 You know, we don't have to be 007 James Bond to have a special assignment, right?

240
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,080
 You have a special assignment.

241
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,080
 Do not buy the lie that you are expendable.

242
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,080
 God put you on earth for a purpose.

243
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:43,080
 Your life matters to Him and to those He is positioning you to serve.

244
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,080
 Okay, we come on to Wednesday.

245
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,080
 The truth is this, the cross has the final word.

246
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
 Can we say it all together?

247
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,080
 The cross has the final word.

248
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,080
 What Jesus did on the cross defines your life.

249
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,080
 It gives you victory over death.

250
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
 We've been singing about it.

251
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
 You're identified with Christ.

252
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
 You're a brand new creation.

253
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,080
 You are not unwanted, unlovely or worthless.

254
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,080
 You are wanted by God, made in the image of God and worthy of Christ's love because He

255
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,080
 has chosen to place worth upon you.

256
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:32,080
 Your identity was born in the death, the burial and the resurrection of Christ.

257
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,080
 And wasn't that wonderful last Saturday morning when we celebrated that at the beach.

258
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:48,080
 Do not let anyone try to convince you of anything that wasn't demonstrated to you when Christ gave His life for you.

259
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,080
 You are forgiven.

260
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,080
 You're made whole.

261
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
 You are holy in Christ.

262
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,080
 You were born into a new family.

263
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,080
 You are woven into divine plans and purposes.

264
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
 Gone.

265
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
 Your guilt is gone.

266
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
 Free.

267
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,080
 You are free.

268
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,080
 So plant this thought in your mind that the cross has the final word and memorize this

269
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,080
 scripture from 2 Corinthians.

270
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
 Ready?

271
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
 1, 2, 3.

272
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,080
 "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.

273
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,080
 The old has passed away.

274
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,080
 Behold, the new has come."

275
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,080
 As we get on to Thursday, talk about us serving.

276
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,080
 The truth is I serve at the pleasure of the King.

277
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
 Can we say that together?

278
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,080
 I serve at the pleasure of the King.

279
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,080
 You know the work of Jesus Christ transforms your work.

280
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,080
 You don't merely work at a job.

281
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,080
 Charles, you don't just work at AIA.

282
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:03,080
 You serve Jesus Christ, the King of Kings.

283
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,080
 In the light of this truth, here is a new personal vision for you.

284
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,080
 It's a statement you can remind yourself each day.

285
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,080
 I am dispatched by the Holy Spirit.

286
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:23,080
 I'm on kingdom assignments to be light in a darkened world so that others can see Jesus.

287
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,080
 If you look at your work that way, you'll see it in a completely different light.

288
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:35,080
 So plant this thought in your mind and memorize this scripture together from 1 Peter 2.

289
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,080
 Ready?

290
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:45,080
 "But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession,

291
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:53,080
 that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light."

292
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,080
 So we're on to Friday.

293
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:05,080
 Jesus is Lord and Jesus is my Lord.

294
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,080
 Can we say that together?

295
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,080
 Jesus is Lord and Jesus is my Lord.

296
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,080
 Our God is stronger than anything, higher than anything and worthy of all praise.

297
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
 Your God is the great King.

298
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
 His kingdom is forever.

299
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,080
 His plans are unassailable and sure.

300
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,080
 So plant this in your mind.

301
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,080
 Jesus is Lord.

302
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
 It's not just Jesus.

303
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,080
 It's not enough.

304
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,080
 Jesus is Lord and Jesus is my Lord.

305
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,080
 And memorize this scripture, Philippians 2.

306
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
 Ready?

307
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,080
 1, 2, 3.

308
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:45,080
 "Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him the name that is above every name,

309
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:52,080
 that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth,

310
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:59,080
 and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."

311
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,080
 Amen.

312
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:07,080
 Okay, next Saturday, just before you come back here again with our new teaching series,

313
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
 the truth is this.

314
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,080
 My God turns evil into good.

315
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,080
 Can we repeat that one?

316
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,080
 My God turns evil into good.

317
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,080
 Life doesn't always work out the way you hope.

318
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,080
 We are living on a broken planet.

319
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
 Just read the news headlines.

320
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:34,080
 But no circumstance can hinder the seeds we've just discussed from being cultivated in your mind.

321
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:43,080
 No hardship or disappointment or disease or divorce or darkness or desert can stunt the growth of godly thoughts

322
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,080
 from becoming mighty trees in your way of thinking.

323
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
 So plant this thought in your mind.

324
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,080
 My God turns evil into good.

325
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,080
 And memorize this scripture from Romans 8.

326
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,080
 I think we all know this one.

327
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
 1, 2, 3.

328
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:07,080
 "And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God,

329
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,080
 to those who accord according to His purpose."

330
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,080
 KFCI.

331
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:20,080
 God has spoken these truths in His Word.

332
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:27,080
 If we can start here, if we can plant these in our minds,

333
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,080
 if we can keep nurturing them until the Word takes root and grows and produces a crop,

334
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,080
 it will change your life.

335
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,080
 It will change this church.

336
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:45,080
 And I believe it will transform our city.

337
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,080
 The garden is your mind.

338
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:56,080
 Where you are growing a transformed person by planting God's Word.

339
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,080
 And that person is sitting at the table.

340
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,080
 The place of fellowship with the Good Shepherd.

341
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,080
 Where you don't want to give the enemy a seat.

342
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:20,080
 Where you want to enjoy a meal with the Lord and it's not plastic fruit from Taobao.

343
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,080
 Don't be scared.

344
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:33,080
 Jesus, the Good Shepherd, guides you all the way.

345
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:41,080
 I now want to wrap up 10 weeks in less than 10 minutes.

346
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,080
 Scripture is clear.

347
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
 Jesus lives in you.

348
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,080
 And when Jesus lives in you, your slate is clean.

349
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,080
 You are set free from condemnation.

350
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:00,080
 You're given a new life and you're placed into a new family.

351
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,080
 You have a relationship with God through Jesus.

352
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,080
 Christ's work on the cross got you out of death.

353
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,080
 So now your life can be lived, fully surrendered to Him.

354
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:21,080
 You are alive in the Spirit, alive by the Spirit, alive for Christ, alive in Christ,

355
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,080
 so that He might be glorified.

356
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,080
 This is not a negotiation.

357
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:38,080
 This is a call to completely surrender to Jesus.

358
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,080
 You are completely open, completely available to Him.

359
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,080
 He has given you a new identity.

360
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:54,080
 Your call is to make Him known to the world.

361
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,080
 I don't know about you.

362
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,080
 I want to set my mind on Jesus.

363
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:19,080
 [Sobbing]

364
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:26,080
 I want to constantly fill my mind with Scripture.

365
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,080
 I don't want to waste my time.

366
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,080
 I don't want to get off track.

367
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,080
 I don't want to give the enemy a seat at my table.

368
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,080
 I want to set my mind on the Spirit and daily surrender to Him.

369
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,080
 God has made a way for you and me.

370
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,080
 And it's not by having our own way.

371
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,080
 It's by entering into the process of making Christ known in the world.

372
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:05,080
 I know I want God to move in a supernatural way in my life.

373
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,080
 I don't want average.

374
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,080
 I don't want the easiest path.

375
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,080
 I want to know God intimately, deeply.

376
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,080
 I want my life to defy explanation.

377
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,080
 And I'm thinking, this is the life that you want too.

378
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,080
 This kind of life can be yours.

379
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,080
 One that is fully dependent on the power of the Holy Spirit

380
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,080
 and is activated by you stepping forward in faith.

381
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:45,080
 Too often, we want to see miracles first before we take a step.

382
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,080
 "Okay God, you do something great and then I'll take a step."

383
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,080
 "Give me all the right words first and then I'll take the microphone."

384
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,080
 "Give me all the money first and then I'll start with what you called me to do."

385
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:06,080
 "Give me the spouse I need and then I'll step into the unknown."

386
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:11,080
 But the fullness of the life that Jesus provides becomes evidence to us often

387
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,080
 when we move and we act upon his leading.

388
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:23,080
 When we open our mouth and speak.

389
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:30,080
 The steps we take in faith activate the power of the Spirit.

390
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:37,080
 Just as I'm speaking now, I've just got a picture of a beach and a seafront.

391
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:44,080
 Too many Christians are sitting on a beach waiting for the sea to come in.

392
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,080
 "I haven't heard from God yet. I'm just going to sit here."

393
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,080
 When God is saying, "Put your foot in the water."

394
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,080
 "See what the water is like and I'll take you."

395
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,080
 That will activate the power of the Spirit.

396
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,080
 That's your call today.

397
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,080
 Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.

398
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
 You can win the battle for your mind.

399
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,080
 Don't give in to sin, despair or darkness.

400
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,080
 Take every thought captive.

401
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:19,080
 Bind every thought that doesn't come from God.

402
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,080
 Fill your mind with goodness and the richness of Scripture.

403
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
 Memorize with Scripture.

404
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,080
 This is just a start but start with this.

405
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,080
 Memorize the Scripture and become as Michelle told us,

406
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,080
 the DJ of your mind.

407
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,080
 Letting thoughts of God consistently fill your heart and life.

408
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:48,080
 My friends, surrender your life completely to Jesus

409
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:55,080
 and He will lead you to green pastures and quiet waters.

410
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:01,080
 He will lead you through dark valleys because you don't ever need to fear.

411
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,080
 You will not be in want because Jesus will restore your soul.

412
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,080
 Jesus will lead you to a table in the presence of your enemies

413
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:19,080
 but there's nothing to worry about because your head is dripping with anointing.

414
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,080
 Your cup overflows with abundance

415
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:32,080
 and goodness and mercy are following you all the days of your life.

416
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:42,080
