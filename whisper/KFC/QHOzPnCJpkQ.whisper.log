[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040]   Christmas, Christmas is on its way, finally, it's getting a little bit colder.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.640]   You know, actually coming back to KFC and walking through the Far East Finance Centre
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.800]   and seeing all the decorations, it really reminded me of four years ago, four years
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.040]   ago when we first came, my family and I, we first landed in Hong Kong just under four
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.000]   years ago, right, and we landed on I think on the 22nd of December or something like
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.680]   that and then the 23rd we came, we were just completely still jet-lagged, completely shocked,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.040]   and we came to the pantry where you all were having your Christmas party.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.800]   So just stepping in and seeing all of it was just wow, how things have changed, how things
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.640]   have changed, but really, really glad to be back here, I've missed you all, I've been
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.480]   glad to be able to see all of you here today and how we've all grown in different ways.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.400]   Quite a lot has happened in these last few years, just tiny bits have happened and now
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.520]   we have Agnes who was the first person from church, actually the first person we met or
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.800]   saw in Hong Kong, she was at the airport waiting for us, didn't really know her well and now
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.560]   she's holding her grandchild from Alex and Joe, what a blessing it is.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.200]   You guys have been going through the Book of 1 Corinthians, what a crazy book, it's
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.440]   one of my favourites growing up, admittedly I haven't spent as much time in it recently
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.960]   but I remember some key passages, for me I had 1 Corinthians 9.27 etched onto my basketball
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.920]   shoes when I was playing at university, I disciplined my body, training it to do what
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.520]   it should, lest after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.480]   As you guys go through the whole of 1 Corinthians, this majestic book, I want to ask you a question,
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.100]   what would you say this letter has been about?
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.680]   As you've gone through all these different chapters, 15 chapters, what would you say
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.680]   the Book of 1 Corinthians is about?
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.200]   Now let me tell you what I think it's about, I think it's about how your faith impacts
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.560]   every element of your life, every single element, whether it's marriage, love, sex, how you
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.800]   deal with lawsuits, how you eat, how you worship, how you deal with your spiritual gifts, how
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.040]   you commit together as a church, 1 Corinthians tells you everything about how to live as
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440]   a Christian.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.480]   Some people I meet are like, "No James, no actually my faith side is this side, it's
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.000]   on my Saturday night or on my Sunday morning and then maybe I'll have one evening in the
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.960]   week where it's my Christian-y stuff but the work stuff, they don't really mix.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.200]   I am a Christian, I do believe but then actually it's only this part of my life that it exists
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   in."
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.720]   But the problem is, what Paul says in 1 Corinthians is, "No, that can't be the case.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.280]   God has to infiltrate, has to impact every part of your life.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.840]   There is no room that he cannot enter."
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.680]   And that's what 1 Corinthians is about and he finishes with this final chapter, the most
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.960]   majestic of all, the peak, the crown, the climax of 1 Corinthians and it's 1 Corinthians
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.940]   15 and it's about the topic of resurrection.
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.400]   In fact, this chapter here is described as the chapter on resurrection full stop in the
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.440]   whole Bible.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.300]   If you want to find out anything about the resurrection, it's 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.440]   So I invite you today to turn to 1 Corinthians 15.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.600]   Maybe you have a paper Bible, if you have a phone as well, that's okay.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.660]   I won't judge you but I will recommend that you get a paper Bible.
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.940]   These are great.
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.680]   They are constantly on do not disturb focus mode.
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.400]   There are no notifications coming at you and you can scribble on them and easily look up
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   passages as well.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.120]   Anyway, but 1 Corinthians 15 and I've cheekily not put them up on the screen so I would love
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.080]   for you to be able to follow along, scribble down notes, whatever you want, even on your
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.400]   apps, those are very good too.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   But follow along as we look at what it means, what the resurrection means.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.280]   Verse 1, it starts off as this.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.400]   He says, "Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.560]   received and which you stand and by which you are being saved."
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   He says, "I want to remind you something.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.280]   You seem to have forgotten.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   You seem to have lost your way a little bit so I must remind you, I must rewind your mind
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.680]   back to what I had taught you and I want to tell you something that's very, very important
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.720]   because you've strayed away from it and it's about the resurrection."
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.080]   I want to give you a little bit of context here.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.800]   Now, of course, you guys have been in this series for quite a long time so no doubt you'll
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.400]   know a little bit about the Church of Corinth.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.280]   Paul's writing to this Church of Corinth, which he planted and he spent a lot of time
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.640]   there, and Corinth itself is a cosmopolitan city.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.720]   People from all over the world would go into and descend into this city and it was filled
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.680]   with intellectuals, it was filled with businessmen, it was filled with very high-functioning,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.240]   highly successful people, much like Hong Kong.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.720]   Just down the road from Corinth, about 50 miles down, was the place called Athens.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.760]   Athens was this cultural centre, capital.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.980]   Anyone who was anybody would go through Athens and Corinth.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.280]   One of the big things about Athens and Corinth was this idea of Greek philosophy.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   Philosophers would go there.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.840]   In London, there's this place called Speaker's Corner.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.560]   Has anyone been to Speaker's Corner?
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.480]   Where very intellectual people will stand and debate and argue and spend a lot of time
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.720]   just talking and spitting at each other.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.360]   Now, this was in some ways similar.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.600]   Athens had that.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.880]   It was that kind of vibe.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.920]   And of course, it was so close to Corinth.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.620]   So these two cities would constantly mix people.
[00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.280]   And the problem here is this.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:47.920]   The believers in Corinth started to have some of the societal truths from the city of Corinth
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.720]   seep into their church, seep into the way they did church, seep into the way they were
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   Christians.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.120]   And they would say, "Oh, my God, that's ridiculous.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.480]   The Bible should not be compromised in any way."
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.560]   But here's the thing.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:07.200]   The churches that are based in cities so often, and we included, are at risk of being compromised
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.360]   by societal truths.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.760]   How would you describe Hong Kong?
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.880]   Hong Kong is maybe a money-making city.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.280]   It's a consumeristic city.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.900]   It's a very corporate city.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.360]   And you see how we have the risk of it.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.040]   And I pray that our church does not have this.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.400]   It has the risk of having those values seep into church life.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.800]   This is exactly what happened in Corinth.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.040]   The Greek philosophers, the way they thought, the way they argued, the way they debated,
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.640]   started seeping into the church of Corinth.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.240]   And what was the one thing that they were arguing about?
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.080]   There cannot be, there is not a resurrection.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.560]   They did not believe it.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.600]   And so within the church, people were starting to think, "Oh, maybe there wasn't a resurrection.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.880]   Maybe Jesus does all these things, and he was a great prophet, and he was a good guy.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.200]   But maybe he didn't resurrect."
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.080]   Some of the people were using it to their advantage.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.200]   Do you know how?
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.960]   They were saying, "Oh, the resurrection has already happened spiritually.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.640]   We, our souls, have already resurrected and gone to heaven.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.600]   Do you know what that means?
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.040]   What we do with our flesh physically here on earth doesn't matter.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:19.380]   We can do whatever we want because we've already ascended spiritually into heaven.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.320]   We can do whatever we want here and satisfy all the desires of our heart here."
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:28.040]   It was this over-realised eschatology saying, "Hey, we don't have to care about our bodies
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.960]   because our souls are done.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.700]   It's time to play."
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.780]   So Paul's writing to these people, he's saying, "I want to remind you, I want to remind you
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.920]   about the resurrection.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:44.000]   I want to ask you, how often do you think about the resurrection?"
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.860]   We sang some beautiful songs today, well chosen by Florence, about the resurrection.
[00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.440]   But sometimes we take that word for granted, "Oh yeah, Jesus died and rose again."
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.680]   Can we just pause for a second?
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.680]   What actually happened?
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:05.360]   That Jesus, this man, this fully human man died, but then he came back to life.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.840]   So today I want to focus on that.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.600]   I want to focus on what the resurrection really means as a truth.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.080]   And there's really three kinds of aspects that we can look at this, and they're coming
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.440]   up on the slides right now.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.580]   The three kinds of truths that the resurrection is, as we look into 1 Corinthians 15, is one,
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.640]   it's a historical truth.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.400]   It's a historical truth.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.780]   Number two, it's an essential truth.
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.420]   And number three, it's an applicable truth.
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.380]   Historical, essential and applicable truth.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.520]   And I'll go through each one for us today.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.780]   Verse three, chapter 15, verse three, it says this, "For I delivered to you as of first
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:45.280]   importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.980]   that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures."
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.580]   And we'll stop there for a second.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.680]   Of first importance, what I received.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.880]   So I'm not making this up.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.880]   I'm not making this up.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.880]   I didn't create this.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.880]   I didn't write this.
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.760]   I received it and now I'm passing it on to you.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.700]   And it's of the most importance.
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.220]   There are other parts of the faith, but this is the most important.
[00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.220]   What is it?
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:12.520]   In three short sentences, he basically sums up the gospel, the kerygma, which is what?
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:19.080]   Number one, Jesus Christ was buried, oh sorry, died for our sins according to the Scriptures.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.560]   Jesus Christ died.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.520]   Not too shocking right now because everyone dies.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.680]   We will all die.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.400]   Jesus Christ died, but he didn't just die just for giggles.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.400]   He died for our sins, number two.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.860]   Sorry, still part of number one actually, 1B.
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.760]   He died for our sins and 1C is according to the Scriptures.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.520]   So what he's saying here is number one, Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   Scriptures.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:47.920]   He's saying Jesus died according to the Scriptures saying, "I'm not making this up.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.680]   I'm not making this up."
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.200]   This was a prophecy from hundreds of years ago.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.680]   What was he probably thinking of?
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.720]   Maybe Isaiah 53.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.320]   Maybe some of you don't know Isaiah 53.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.220]   Maybe you know the song that we've sang more recently, Man of Sorrows.
[00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.400]   He was pierced for our transgressions.
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:07.040]   The sinless man died as a ransom for many.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.200]   He's probably thinking about that.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   That's number one.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.040]   Number two, he said he was buried in a tomb.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.600]   Just like a normal living human being, he died and then he was buried in a tomb.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.800]   And you've heard about this tomb because it was a tomb that was bought by Josephus.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.280]   So even historians who aren't Christians know that Jesus Christ, this man existed and that
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.800]   he died and was buried in a tomb.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.880]   Number three, on the third day he rose again.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.600]   Again, according to the Scriptures.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   That's what he's saying.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.600]   He repeats it again saying, "This is a prophecy.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.960]   This isn't something that I'm making up.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.480]   This man died and he rose again."
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.480]   What prophecies was he thinking about?
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.040]   What Scriptures was he thinking about?
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.400]   Maybe Jonah.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.760]   Maybe how Jonah wasn't allowed to stay in the belly of the fish for three days, but
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.120]   rose again after three days.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.120]   Came out of the fish.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.360]   Jesus Christ himself referenced Jonah.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:56.600]   Jesus Christ himself said, "The Son of Man will die, but in three days will come back."
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.480]   He's saying, "We're not making this up."
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.820]   It's according to the Scriptures.
[00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:06.780]   There's been days of about 300 prophecies in the Old Testament pointing to Jesus, pointing
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.220]   to what he did.
[00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.540]   So it is historical truth.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.140]   I want to pause here and I'm going to ask you a question.
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.820]   Why are you a Christian?
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:25.900]   Why are you Gordon, Florence, Cherry, Julie, why are you a Christian?
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.220]   Have a think about that for a second.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.100]   Maybe someone's asked you that at work.
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.940]   Why are you a Christian?
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:38.540]   Maybe the most common answer is, "Well, I was born into a Christian family and so went
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.720]   to church from a young age, went to Sunday school, and then maybe kind of got more serious
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.780]   as I went to university."
[00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.020]   Or maybe, "I'm a Christian because actually I just want to be a good person.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:52.060]   I want to be a good person, so I'm a Christian."
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.180]   Or maybe you're a Christian because you're like, "I really like, I think it's a really
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.500]   good philosophy to go by.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.340]   It's a really good set of values.
[00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.660]   It's a good way of life.
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.660]   Christianity good."
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.820]   Christians are fairly nice, most of them.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.420]   So I want to be a Christian.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.020]   Let me tell you why you should be a Christian.
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.060]   Let me tell you why we should all be a Christian.
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.660]   Let me tell you the primary reason why we should be a Christian.
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:24.300]   Because someone died and rose again.
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.200]   Christianity, primarily, the reason why you believe in it is because you believe that
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.500]   someone died and rose again.
[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:35.660]   Paul's saying here, "If that person didn't die, nothing else matters."
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.640]   That is the most important piece.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.100]   You believe in Christianity because it's true, because it happened, because 2,000 years ago
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.380]   there was a man who came who was the Son of God, who died for the sins of many, was buried
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:53.780]   in a tomb, but then left the tomb and rose again on the third day.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.780]   That's why you're a Christian.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.820]   Have you thought about it like that?
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.540]   That you're a Christian, not because it's a nice way to live, you're a Christian because
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:07.920]   something happened that snapped time into half and changed the course of humanity completely
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.260]   because someone died and rose again and defied the laws of science.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.940]   It's a historical truth.
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.220]   There's an empty tomb to prove it.
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:22.920]   But then you might say, "Well, actually, the empty tomb, maybe the soldiers that were guarding
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.220]   the tomb were bribed.
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.260]   Maybe they were just given a little bit of money, 'Hey, let us take this body and we
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.940]   can do a little conspiracy thing with it.'"
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.340]   But you see, the problem is this.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:36.260]   Soldiers those days, if they were entrusted to guard a prison or guard a tomb, they had
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.660]   to guard it with their lives.
[00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.940]   If anything happened or if anything happened on their watch that was wrong, that was bad,
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.940]   what would happen?
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.900]   That soldier would have to be put to death, as well as their family.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.980]   Suddenly, you think, "Well, that doesn't make sense then because why would they take in
[00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.260]   any money?"
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.620]   Because their whole family would die.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.620]   It's not the soldiers.
[00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.400]   But then you think, "Oh, actually, maybe it's the Pharisees or the Romans."
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.220]   Because they had heard the whispers that these Jesus followers were starting to say, "Jesus
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.220]   is going to rise again.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.220]   Jesus is going to rise again.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.220]   You know what?
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.220]   The best way to guarantee that doesn't happen?
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.040]   Let's take the body away."
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.260]   Then they can't do anything with it.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.260]   "We'll protect it.
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.260]   We'll guard it."
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.460]   You know, maybe that makes sense.
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:21.380]   But then it doesn't because at any moment then, as Christianity was growing and eventually
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.060]   outgrows the whole Roman Empire, at any moment, they could have brought the body back out
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.300]   and said, "Actually, guys, that Jesus isn't alive.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.300]   Here's the body.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.940]   We did take him away for safekeeping, but he's here now.
[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.380]   So all of you can just pipe down."
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.580]   So it can't be the Pharisees and it can't really be the Romans.
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.380]   What about the followers of Jesus themselves?
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:46.660]   Could they even find, "Hey, maybe they're just grieving from wasting three years following
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.980]   this man and now he's gone.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.260]   And now suddenly they've lost their jobs, they've lost their families, they've lost
[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.420]   everything, and so they're like, 'You know what?
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.380]   I'm grieving and I'm in denial.
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.180]   Let's take the body and let's make up something.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.180]   Let's just keep faith.'"
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.340]   Again, that's kind of like, "Oh, that kind of makes sense."
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:09.780]   Until you think for the next 40 years, those people were willing to die for this faith.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:15.020]   Surely at one point, when someone was being tortured or beaten or persecuted or just about
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:18.400]   to die, surely they would have been like, "You know what?
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.740]   It was all a joke.
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.380]   It was just, we were just having a little fun."
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.180]   Like he's not resurrected.
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.380]   But that's not the case.
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.620]   He actually transformed something.
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.900]   There's this quote, and I want to read it to you.
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:31.900]   I think it's going to be on the slides.
[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.900]   It's by this guy called Charles Colson.
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:39.500]   He was an attorney and he was a political advisor during the President Nixon era.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.540]   And he said this about the Watergate scandal.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.500]   Do we know what the Watergate scandal is?
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.700]   Maybe anyone who's under 30 may not know.
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:50.300]   It was a political scandal in the US, which back then was a big thing, but nowadays probably
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.300]   not so much.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:57.100]   But anyway, this Charles Colson said this, "I know the resurrection is a fact and Watergate,
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.620]   the scandal, proved it to me."
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.620]   How?
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:02.700]   "Because 12 men testified they had seen Jesus raised from the dead.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:07.220]   Then they proclaimed that truth for 40 years, never once denying it.
[00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.100]   Everyone was beaten, tortured, stoned, and put in prison.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.780]   They would not have endured that if it weren't true.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:18.020]   Watergate embroiled 12 of the most powerful men in the world, and they couldn't keep
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:20.660]   a lie for three weeks."
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:28.060]   You're telling me 12 apostles, fishermen, all kinds of people could keep a lie for 40
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.060]   years?
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.740]   Absolutely impossible.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.140]   The resurrection is a historical truth.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.140]   Furthermore, on top of the empty tomb, there were witnesses.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.900]   And Paul talks about those witnesses, and he starts in verse 5, "And that he appeared
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.540]   to Cephas," which is Peter, "then to the 12.
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:49.060]   Then he appeared to more than 500 brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive,
[00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.840]   though some have fallen asleep.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.420]   Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.620]   Last of all, he appeared to me."
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:56.620]   Paul.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:03.120]   He's saying, not only is there an empty tomb, not only are there witnesses, but these witnesses
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:04.860]   were completely transformed.
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.300]   He mentions Peter, saying Peter saw him.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.100]   Do you remember what Peter was like when Jesus was around?
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.100]   Or maybe when Jesus was arrested?
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.900]   Do you remember what that Peter was like?
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.220]   He was like, "No, I don't know him.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.220]   I don't know him.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.540]   No, he must be mistaking me for someone else."
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.540]   He was obnoxious.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.540]   He was impulsive.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.980]   What was the Peter like in Acts?
[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.740]   The one who Jesus built the church on.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.380]   That was a completely different Peter.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:31.820]   Something happened pre-Peter, pre-Jesus' death, and post-Jesus' death, Peter was completely
[00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:32.820]   transformed.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:33.820]   Do you remember James?
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.260]   James as in Jesus' brother.
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:39.740]   Scripture actually says, "Jesus' family, his brothers, didn't believe that he was God."
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:40.940]   Of course, I don't blame them.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.940]   Why would you?
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.780]   If my brother kept going around saying that I'm the Son of God, you actually wouldn't
[00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.460]   believe him.
[00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.500]   But then what happened?
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:57.060]   He saw his own brother die on a cross, and then in three days' time, he saw him again.
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:59.060]   That transforms James.
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:05.580]   And then he says, "And 500 people, some of which are still alive," because this was written
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.860]   about 20 years after Jesus.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:08.860]   What's Paul saying here?
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.380]   There's 500 people who saw him.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.380]   Find them.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:13.380]   They're still around.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.340]   Some of them have died, but some of them are still around.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.340]   Ask them.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.660]   If this was a lie, he wouldn't have said that.
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.780]   There were witnesses, and furthermore, these witnesses were completely transformed.
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.500]   Most of all, final one of all at this point, Paul himself.
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.300]   Who was Paul before he was Paul?
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:35.980]   Saul, the persecutor of the church, the one who stood and watched Stephen, a man, proclaim
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:38.180]   the gospel and get stoned to death.
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.300]   That's Saul.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:43.700]   Now, from being the biggest persecutor of the church, becomes the most prolific church
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.580]   planter ever.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.060]   Something happened.
[00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:53.520]   His explanation, his reason, is that he met Jesus.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.900]   He met Jesus, the resurrected one.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.940]   First of all, why you believe in Christianity is because of the resurrection, because this
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:05.020]   resurrection is a historical truth.
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:06.580]   It actually happens.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:10.020]   Number two, it's an essential truth.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.020]   It's an essential truth.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.900]   Now, I just said that Christianity isn't about giving you a better way of life.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.540]   It isn't about giving you an emotional crutch so you can feel better about yourself as you
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.620]   navigate the challenges of this world.
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:21.860]   It's not just about that.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.460]   Now, those things are fruits of believing in Christ and getting that hope, but it's
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.900]   not the main thing.
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.580]   Just because you get a better life here, it doesn't address the biggest issue that we
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.580]   all have.
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.580]   And what are those issues?
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.860]   That is sin and death.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.920]   We are all sinners.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.580]   We are all needing of a saviour.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.340]   I know this is a really somber Christmas message.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.180]   Merry Christmas.
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.080]   You're a sinner and you need saving.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.060]   And your sin will lead you to death.
[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:59.020]   And Romans 6 says this, "And the wages of sin is death."
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:02.460]   Because we are sinners, because we've made mistakes, because we're not perfect, we don't
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.420]   have a chance getting into the perfect heaven.
[00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:12.420]   Because of what we've done, there is a price that must be paid.
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:18.420]   The death and resurrection of Jesus addresses the issue of sin and death.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.540]   It's an essential truth.
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.340]   You can't get away from it.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.260]   You cannot get away from it.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.260]   Why?
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:31.020]   Because the moment Adam sinned, the moment Adam, well, the moment Adam did not have a
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.100]   brain of his own and just listened to what he was told to do and just took a bite of
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:40.340]   the apple, the moment he turned away from God and felt shame, he sinned, what happened
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.660]   was he put humanity under death's power.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.460]   From that moment, he turned his back on God and the biggest problem with sin is that we
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.940]   are now separated from God.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:52.940]   Think about God.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.540]   God is the source of life, hope, joy, and love.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.460]   Surely then, the worst thing that could possibly happen to any of us is being separated from
[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.340]   those things and through sin, that's what happens.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:10.460]   When we choose to turn ourselves away from God, that is sin and that is when we are separated
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.460]   from God.
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:19.100]   That's why Jesus had to die because that price had to be paid.
[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:24.300]   That bill had to be settled and through the death, he atoned for our sins.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.780]   I talked about this before and we sang about it.
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.780]   Atonement.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.580]   Jesus' death brings us atonement and what is atonement?
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.100]   At-one-ment.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.900]   It brings us back.
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:39.960]   From the moment we were separated, from the moment of Adam, atonement, Jesus dying, brings
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   us back.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:46.220]   So Jesus' death addresses the issue of sin and the resurrection addresses the issue of
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.220]   death.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:49.980]   Up until then, death has had the final say.
[00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:55.820]   Right now, we all will die and we think that's the final say but in the resurrection, we
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:01.180]   find out that actually death doesn't have the final say because what does the resurrection
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.620]   tell you?
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:09.100]   Someone died, told us he would do that, then he came back to life.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.020]   That means there's something beyond the grave.
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.420]   Someone died and rose again, which means there's something beyond the grave, which means our
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:20.780]   greatest fear that we're going to die and go into the abyss and be separated isn't true
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:25.220]   because there's something that happens after the grave and that someone wasn't just anyone.
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:32.900]   It was the sinless one who paid for our sins and then he rose again.
[00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:35.080]   What significance does that have?
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.500]   Because he said that he was going to die and rise again and then it actually happened,
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.380]   well, I'll tell you what this means.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.220]   He can be trusted.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.680]   If I told you, "Guys, I'm going to die tonight but don't worry.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.760]   I'm going to come back in three days and next week I'll be back here and then you actually
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:55.180]   see me die and then next week you see me back," I think you're going to pay attention to me.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:23:00.620]   Pay attention to what I'm going to say, at least more than right now because Jesus put
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.900]   his money where his mouth was.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.660]   讲得出,做得到.
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.700]   This interesting quote from Tim Keller, I think it's also on the screen, I'll read it
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.700]   to you.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:15.080]   "If Jesus rose from the dead, then you have to accept all that he said.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.540]   If he didn't rise from the dead, then why worry about any of what he said?
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:24.940]   The issue on which everything hangs is not whether or not you like his teaching, but
[00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:28.700]   whether or not he rose from the dead."
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.900]   The issue on which everything hangs is not whether or not you like his teaching, but
[00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:37.700]   whether or not he rose from the dead.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.540]   And Paul then says this, he said, "Look, if you're saying that there is no resurrection
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.460]   from the dead and Jesus didn't rise from the dead, I'll tell you what this means."
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.740]   In verse 14, he starts a list and we'll fly through it.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:53.740]   He says, verse 14, "And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.300]   and your faith is in vain.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:24:01.260]   If Jesus didn't die and rise again, me standing here preaching is completely pointless.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.260]   It doesn't mean a single thing.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:08.020]   However good I am at speaking, however good I make you feel, however many tips about life
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.260]   to help you feel better, it does not matter.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.460]   All of it is in vain.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.420]   Your faith is also in vain."
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:18.140]   And carries on, "We are even found to be misrepresenting God because we testify about
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.420]   God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise, if it is true that the dead are not
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.420]   raised."
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.100]   If Jesus didn't rise from the dead, we're actually all false witnesses.
[00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.100]   We're all liars.
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.100]   We're all liars.
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:31.740]   "For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised and if Christ has not
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:36.460]   been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins."
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.700]   Because that means your sin hasn't been addressed.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:39.900]   That means the wage hasn't been paid.
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.500]   The debt hasn't been paid.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.480]   You are still in your sins and you are still heading to death and you are still heading
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.860]   to eternal separation.
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:56.860]   But someone said that he is the resurrection and the life and then showed us that he actually
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.860]   is.
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.020]   That changes everything.
[00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.180]   It changes everything.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.900]   Paul's also not saying, hey, he's not just saying, remember, Christ Jesus died and rose
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:08.900]   again.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.900]   That's not the only thing he's saying.
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.740]   What else is he saying?
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:19.780]   He's saying because Christ died and rose again, so will you.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:23.940]   That brothers and sisters is the game changer.
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:30.980]   Because Christ died and rose again, so will you.
[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:40.580]   Imagine if you truly believed and lived as though your death is not final.
[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:46.380]   Every year for Reuben's birthday, we like to take him somewhere fun and one of the main
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:50.060]   things he loves is going laser questing.
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.060]   Anyone like laser questing here?
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:52.060]   A couple of us.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:53.060]   I love laser quest.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:58.420]   I'm a bit too much of a wimp to go paintballing because that actually hurts.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.660]   The BB gunning really kind of hurts, especially if it clips the back of your ear as well.
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.740]   But laser quest is great.
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.740]   Why is laser quest great?
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:16.300]   And then someone shoots me, and then in five seconds, and I'm back again.
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:20.660]   Now if you take it further, there's laser quest and then more hardcore, there's paintballing
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:25.260]   and of course I'm nowhere near real battle and real war where you only get one chance
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.540]   and once you get that chance, you've got a gun.
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:34.060]   Imagine though if you lived in a way where you didn't fear death anymore.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.620]   Just imagine what that is like.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:41.260]   There's a song that we sang that alluded to this, that even though your outer self is
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.900]   wasting away, your inner self is being renewed day by day.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.060]   That what you're going to receive is this eternal weight of glory that doesn't compare
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.580]   to anything that you're going to struggle with here.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:57.580]   Nothing that can happen to you here is going to hurt you in eternity.
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:05.180]   Imagine just for a moment that you get to live life like that, without this fear of
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.780]   death.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.860]   What does that do to you?
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.580]   Which leads me to my final point.
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.140]   The resurrection is a historical truth, it's an essential truth because it addresses sin
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.860]   and death and finally, it's an applicable truth.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.860]   And this is my conclusion, because you might be saying here, "Okay, fine, James, you're
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:28.860]   telling me that this Jewish man existed 2,000 years ago, proclaimed that he is God, he died
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.140]   and he rose again.
[00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.140]   Great.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.540]   And then he flew off into the clouds, into the heavens.
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.140]   What does that mean for me now?
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.100]   What does that do for me now?"
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.700]   And I want to say, have a think about this.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.340]   Not only is it a historical truth and an essential truth for your eternal salvation, there's
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:52.060]   something that it can do for you right here and right now.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:28:00.900]   If the issue that it addresses is sin and death, what it unlocks then is freedom and
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.820]   life.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:07.260]   If the issue that the death and resurrection addresses is sin and death, that means the
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:14.540]   result, the application here is that you will have freedom and life and no more sin and
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:15.740]   death.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:20.780]   And so I continue to ask you, imagine what it is like if you lived as though your body
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.100]   might be dying, but you'll always be alive.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.460]   It's a song quote from Phil Wickham.
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.300]   Imagine if that was the case.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:31.460]   Well, first of all, it will change the way you live.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:36.060]   Finally, you will have purpose to live because you're like, "Well, this isn't all there is.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:41.420]   I'm living here in this little bit, but I've got all this to look out for, to look forward
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.420]   to."
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:48.260]   I went on a retreat this week and I went to Toronto and we walked past Sayoun and you kept
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.740]   going up, kept going up, and then there's a cemetery.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.740]   Has anyone been there?
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:56.620]   There's a cemetery and me and my friend, we were just stood behind the cemetery and we
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.460]   were seeing all these kind of these graves, but it was only a short part of it because
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:07.420]   after the graves would be a railing and then it was just ocean, sky and mountain.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:12.660]   And I was like, "I think I'm stuck here right now between these graves."
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:14.820]   And in Hong Kong, they're extra tight.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:20.940]   And it's extra busy and it's extra gloomy, but this is just a small part of it.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:27.940]   We've not reached eternity shore where if we step through those, we see this vast expanse.
[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.660]   This eternity awaits us that allows us to...
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:37.780]   Jesus said in John 10, 10, he said, "And I will give you life and life to the full."
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.700]   And he's not just talking about this life here because this is so small.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.180]   Imagine that his vantage point, that this is so small.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.300]   If you put your trust in me, you'll have something called eternal life, which will be all of
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:54.780]   this and you won't be trapped in this cemetery any longer.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.060]   Imagine the freedom that that gives you.
[00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:01.780]   Imagine that how that helps you approach death.
[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.300]   Who's had a death to a loved one in the family before?
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:09.740]   Of course, as you grow old, it's inevitable because every single person that you know
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.420]   will die.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:20.660]   But imagine if you truly believed that Christ raised from the dead and you will too, and
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.900]   that the loved ones who he lifts inside will also rise from the dead too.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.620]   That changes the way you grieve.
[00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.900]   That changes the way you deal with loss.
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:39.900]   Paul says in 1 Thessalonians, he says, "We don't grieve like those who have no hope."
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.940]   We grieve in a different way.
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.500]   We grieve that we don't get to spend these next few decades with our loved one.
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:54.020]   But we grieve with hope because someone died and rose again.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:31:00.420]   And we believe that same power now lives in those who love and follow him.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.380]   That changes how you approach funerals now.
[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.300]   That changes how you live now.
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.740]   That is an applicable truth right now.
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.460]   You'll also be free from sin.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.340]   Paul's talking to these people and rebuking them, saying, "You've lost sight of the resurrection
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.300]   and now you're just giving in to your own desires."
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.420]   The problem is this.
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:21.660]   If you follow that path and giving in to your own desires, where does it lead you?
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:22.980]   Of course, it leads you to death.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:27.300]   But before that, actually, you find that maybe temporarily it's fun.
[00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.680]   Maybe the first few months it's fun.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.140]   Maybe even the first few years it's fun.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.140]   But look around.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.140]   Look around at society.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.440]   Look around at the people that we see, the rich and the famous, all those who get every
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.220]   desire satisfied.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.740]   Do they look happy to you?
[00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:41.860]   Do they look fulfilled to you?
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.740]   Do they look like they're living life to the full to you?
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.060]   No.
[00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.940]   And so because of the resurrection, because of this eternal perspective you get, you now
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.980]   get to live life in a different way.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:57.860]   You get to be free from the sins that corrupt you.
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:05.060]   Your sin has been defeated because the resurrection now has the final say.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.080]   That is the game changer.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.540]   That is the thing that stops you from worrying.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.180]   Who's a worrier here?
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:13.020]   I'm a worrier.
[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.620]   Always thinking about what could happen.
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.060]   Always thinking about missing out on something, missing a deadline, missing something and
[00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:21.140]   then suddenly the whole world is going to fall apart.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:27.340]   The resurrection tells you nothing will fall apart because Christ Jesus broke himself and
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:33.500]   put himself back together and put us back together too.
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:39.060]   So you don't have to worry and Jesus says this in Matthew 6, he says don't worry.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:45.420]   The sparrows, the lilies, I'm looking after them and I'll look after you.
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:47.260]   Why can you believe me?
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:52.780]   I'm going to show you because I'll subject myself to the most horrible torment and the
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.620]   offence and the crucifixion and I'll come back to life.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.900]   Then you will trust me, then you will believe me that I am the resurrection and the life
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.460]   that you don't have to worry about a thing.
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:06.420]   The Barnard group recently did a study.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:13.380]   Do you know what the most commonly highlighted Bible verse in the whole of the Bible is?
[00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.980]   John 3, 16, "For God so loved the world."
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:17.980]   No.
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:22.460]   Romans 8, 28, "And God will work for the good of those who love him."
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.460]   No.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.220]   Philippians 4, 4-7, "Do not be anxious about anything."
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.220]   You probably have this as a fridge magnet.
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:35.020]   "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:40.060]   thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.500]   all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds."
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.860]   We love that verse.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:46.860]   We love it.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.860]   Why?
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.220]   Because we're worriers.
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.860]   And so it's telling us don't be anxious.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.020]   Don't worry.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:59.660]   There's a few words just before that fridge magnet verse that tells you the secret why
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.660]   you don't need to worry.
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.860]   Does anyone know what it is?
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.580]   The Lord is at hand.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:14.060]   Or another version is the Lord is near.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:17.020]   Do not be anxious about anything.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.300]   That's the key.
[00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.340]   That's what the resurrection can do for you if you're a worrier.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.940]   You can remind yourself, "Well, I'm not worshipping a dead God.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.340]   I'm not worshipping a God who couldn't save himself.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:34.180]   I'm worshipping a God who plucked himself from the grave and now stands next to me and
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.620]   the Lord is at hand.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.020]   He is near to me.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:42.820]   So I don't have to be anxious about anything because he's right here."
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.820]   Isn't that freeing?
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.820]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.100]   And the very final verse of this chapter, well, towards the end of it, verse 58.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:53.540]   Oh, actually, here's the very end.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:54.660]   "Therefore."
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.980]   That is the biggest therefore ever.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.500]   We see therefore all the time.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.620]   And of course, Bible teachers will teach you when you see the word therefore, you must
[00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.540]   ask why is it therefore?
[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:05.540]   What's it therefore?
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.540]   What's the context?
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:10.580]   That is the biggest therefore you will find because that's saying if someone died and
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.780]   rose again, therefore.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.980]   This is how you live.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.540]   Can we sense the weight of what that means?
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.860]   How the resurrection can apply into every aspect of your life.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.980]   And this is how he sums up the whole book.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:33.020]   "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of
[00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:37.820]   the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labour is not in vain.
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.500]   Therefore, because someone rose from the dead, you can be steadfast.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:42.500]   You don't need to worry.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.380]   You don't need to be afraid anymore."
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:49.460]   Psalm 27, "The Lord is my light and my salvation.
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.940]   He is the stronghold of my life.
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:52.940]   Whom shall I fear?
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:56.580]   I don't have to be afraid because He's the stronghold of my life.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.060]   He is my light and my salvation and He is here.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:04.940]   And so I can abound in work for the Lord, which means I can grow in my work for the
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.940]   Lord, which means I don't have to work for earthly things, just earthly things anymore.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:16.940]   I can work because there are eternal consequences to be gained, eternal rewards to be gained.
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:21.540]   So none of it is in vain because what we're doing here is this and what we're going to
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.420]   be experiencing is all of this.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:26.860]   So be steadfast.
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.100]   Don't worry.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.100]   Be immovable.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:36.660]   Don't be afraid because someone died and rose again and is now standing next to you."
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:44.420]   All of this because of the resurrection.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.380]   The resurrection that is historical truth.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.100]   It actually happened.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:54.420]   The resurrection because it is essential truth, because it addresses our sin and death and
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.820]   gives us life and freedom.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.700]   The resurrection which is applicable truth.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:03.220]   Right now, there is something in your life that you can apply this resurrection truth
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:04.220]   to.
[00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:08.820]   Literally everything can start with the resurrection.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:14.620]   And you might be like, "James, okay, this is good, but you've got the seasons wrong.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.580]   It's Christmas, not Easter."
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:21.340]   But you see, here's the thing.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:28.540]   Christmas isn't really about a baby being born in a manger.
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.260]   That's not why we celebrate Christmas because I'm sure he wasn't the only baby being born
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:37.780]   in a manger.
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.620]   Christmas is not about a baby being born in a manger.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:46.620]   The reason why we celebrate Christmas is because that baby didn't stay in the manger.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:50.140]   The reason we celebrate Christmas and have all these carols is because that baby didn't
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:56.100]   stay in the manger and ended up growing up to be the sinless man and then ended up on
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.100]   the cross.
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:01.540]   But we celebrate Christmas not because that man stayed on the cross and ended up in a
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.180]   tomb, but because he didn't stay there either.
[00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:09.900]   We celebrate Christmas because this sinless man that started in a manger, ended up on
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:15.700]   a cross and then in a tomb, didn't stay there and then rose again.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:19.580]   And there is now an empty tomb to prove it.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.780]   That is why we celebrate Christmas.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:29.280]   The fact that there is an empty tomb remains to this day.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:36.740]   The fact that there is an empty tomb remains to this day and that fact changes everything.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:37.740]   Do we get that?
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.260]   Let me say that one more time and not if you get this.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:50.780]   The fact that there is an empty tomb remains unchanged and that fact changes everything.
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.920]   That is why we celebrate Christmas.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:59.800]   That is why we rejoice because we no longer have to be afraid, we no longer have to worry,
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:06.140]   we are free from sin, we are free from death, death no longer has its sting all because
[00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:11.540]   someone died and then rose again.
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:14.100]   And now he is with us.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:20.100]   This Christmas season, God is with us, Emmanuel.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.620]   How can we respond today?
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:30.980]   We stretch out our hands and we say, Emmanuel, come into my life.
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:35.180]   O come, O come, Emmanuel.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:40.580]   I am going to invite the worship band up now and as I pray, I invite us all, why don't
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:47.780]   we, just as Alex led us today earlier in lifting our hands up to worship, can we just open
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:58.100]   our hands now as we close our eyes and can we welcome this saviour in?
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:04.620]   Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:11.820]   And as I pray for all of us, allow that truth of the resurrection to seep into your very
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:17.500]   heart, soul and mind.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:24.700]   Jesus we talk and sing about your resurrection all the time, but forgive us that we take
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.940]   it for granted what it really means.
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:34.420]   Because now we know what the resurrection means, it means that you are living and here
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:40.860]   with us and we dare not forget that, we do not want to forget that.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:47.420]   Emmanuel, you are God with us, so come.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:53.300]   Come into our hearts, come into our minds and our souls.
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:57.140]   If there are any rooms that you don't feel as though you can come in, thank you for being
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:07.140]   patient and just gracious and just knocking on our door.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:17.740]   If anyone here feels that there is a room that the saviour has not been in yet, if you
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:24.100]   feel as though there is something that you are holding back from this living Christ,
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:38.620]   this living God, then I want to tell you today, he died, he rose and now he is here and he
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:46.460]   is knocking on your door, asking for you to invite him in.
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:57.460]   And the only appropriate response is to say, "Come on in."
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:02.620]   Oh come, oh come, Emmanuel.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.200]   (gentle music)
