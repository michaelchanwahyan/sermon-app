[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   Thank you, Pastor Johnny.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.360]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.720]   It's so great to be able to worship God with you.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.400]   And today I'll be speaking on the topic, belief.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.680]   Now you know, one of the hardest things sometimes is to have faith.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.920]   I mean, it's easy to have faith when everything is smooth sailing, but it's so much harder
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.600]   when things go south and things are rough.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:39.280]   And how can we still believe when our circumstances or situation seems to be crumbling down?
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.000]   And this is what we're going to be talking about tonight.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.760]   Because usually at that time, what will we feel?
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.400]   We'll feel anxious, worried, or we're not quite sure actually how to pray at that time.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.800]   So should we pray optimistically, but then at the same time, we might get disappointed.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.000]   Now how many people have experienced that?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.480]   Can you put it in the chat box if you have experienced a hard time having faith in God
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.280]   when the circumstances are against you?
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.480]   If you do, you can just say yes in the chat box.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.800]   All right, we've got one.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.480]   And two, maybe a few more.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.480]   Yes, often someone says.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.920]   Yes, yes.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.400]   So yes, and that's the thing.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:40.720]   It just seems like the truth be told, sometimes it is easier to believe and depend on God
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.480]   than other times.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.400]   And no, I'm not talking about like not believing that God has sent Jesus to die on the cross
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.200]   for us and to die for our sins and resurrect.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.280]   We're not talking about that.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   But it's the kind of faith where we can continue to depend on him and trust him in all of our
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.560]   circumstances.
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.680]   Now maybe you might be anxious about which school you should go to, which job you should
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.080]   take, or maybe you're worried about your finances and not having enough to go by for another
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.680]   few months.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.480]   Or you might be anxious about whether or not you ever find yourself a wife or husband or
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.800]   be able to have children.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.600]   And some of us might be worried about going old and having to be by ourselves.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.960]   And I mean, I could just go on and on.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.840]   But our faith in God seems to shrink when God doesn't seem to be acting out as we expect
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.040]   or hope when times are rough.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   And we might lose our peace as well as we constantly think about those problems.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.680]   So what is it about our problems that make it so scary?
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.720]   Is it because it seems to be out of control and impossible to handle?
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.640]   Or is it because the consequences seems to be too unbearable?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.160]   Well, you see, as we focus on the problem, and the more we look at it, the more scared
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   we are.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:15.000]   But if we look towards someone who can save us, and someone who has that power, then we're
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.760]   going to have faith.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.680]   Now one of the imageries that I like a lot is when a baby rests really peacefully in
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.280]   the caretaker's arms.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.420]   And we might even have a few here on screen, but we probably can't put them on.
[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.800]   And it just looks like this, right?
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:41.080]   It almost seems like whatever is happening, COVID, no job, anything, nothing seems to
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.600]   be bothered, or the baby doesn't seem to be bothered by it.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.800]   And today we're actually going to look into the scripture.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.760]   Mark chapter 4, verse 35 to 41.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.680]   And we're very glad because as we are going to listen to the scripture today, we actually
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.000]   have a video to go with it.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.680]   And so we're going to play that, and that will be the exact scripture that we need to
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.040]   read today.
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.120]   That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.960]   Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along just as he was in the boat.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.760]   There were also other boats with him.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:42.720]   A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat so that it was nearly swamped.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.000]   Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:57.680]   The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:15.040]   He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, "Quiet, be still."
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:23.520]   Then the wind died down, and it was completely calm.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.280]   He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid?
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.600]   Do you still have no faith?"
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.080]   They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this?"
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:43.360]   Even the wind and the waves obey him.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:50.640]   So in this account, it might be quite familiar to many of you, because it has been recorded
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.080]   in three out of the four Gospels, except this time we'll look at it specifically as how
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.280]   the Gospel of Mark has recorded it.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.640]   And as you saw, there was a great storm, and the waves were actually breaking the boat.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.200]   The boat was already filled with water, and Jesus was sleeping on the boat.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.120]   Of course, we always wonder, how is it possible that Jesus sleeps like this?
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.680]   But that's what is recorded.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.520]   And they went to wake him up, saying, "Teacher, don't you care that we are perishing?"
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:33.120]   And this is one of the lines that always fascinates us, because right now, the disciples have
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.640]   already been with Jesus for numerous times.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.720]   They've seen him heal the sick and open the eyes of the blind.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:48.800]   And yet, what we still notice is that they're still calling him what?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.640]   "Teacher."
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.920]   And that's actually the very first point that I want to get at, which is, in order for us
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:03.960]   to have that peace in our heart, we actually need to know Jesus as God.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.480]   But they actually only know him as a teacher.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.200]   Now we might wonder, where did this concept of a teacher come from?
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:21.760]   Now we look more closely in Mark chapter 1, verse 27, when Jesus first casted out demons,
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.560]   they were all amazed.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.520]   And that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this?
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.400]   A new teaching with authority?
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:36.120]   He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obeyed him."
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:42.800]   And so they knew that he was a teacher, but this teacher was very different.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:49.040]   He had authority, even over demons, even over the sick.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:55.560]   But in this vision was actually quite limited of what Jesus was, because they could only
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.200]   see that Jesus was a teacher, and hence, it really limited their faith.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:08.520]   And it probably looked like this chart below, that their faith was limited because they
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:15.560]   saw him probably more than a teacher, and you can see it in that box, maybe somewhere
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.200]   between a teacher and God, but they're not quite sure.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:27.920]   And you know, the more unsure we are of who Jesus is, the more we cannot trust him or
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:32.720]   rely on him, especially during hardships.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:39.280]   And here we realize that their faith was limited because they didn't really know who Jesus
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.120]   was.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.440]   And so this brings us to our first point, and that is, we need to recognize that Jesus
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:56.680]   is way more than a teacher, he is God, and that we need to believe that he is God.
[00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.920]   And you see, in this story, it first shows us that it's almost like us, when we first
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.120]   hear about Jesus, we might be like the disciples too.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.160]   We might think that he's a great teacher, someone powerful, maybe someone with even
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.520]   great philosophy, and maybe even authorities over demons.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:24.200]   But maybe we don't really see him as God.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.840]   And that we can't see him as someone who's able to save us in our situation.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:36.800]   And so we must begin to tell ourselves the truth from the Bible, that he is God, and
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.480]   he is savior.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:44.440]   And until we recognize that, Jesus will just be a teacher, and our faith will be wavering
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.880]   all the time.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:53.200]   And this revelation of Jesus being God will be slowly revealed to the disciples.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:00.240]   And as he see, as they saw him go up to the cross, they slowly realize who he was.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.720]   And when he resurrected, that's when they really know that he is God.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:12.360]   And so the same for us, we need to recognize that he is God, so that we can trust him with
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.200]   all our problems.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:20.240]   And the second thing that we notice is that the disciple says, "Do you not care that
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.240]   we perish?"
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:28.180]   Now, really, the second problem with the disciple is that they questioned if Jesus really cared
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.180]   for them.
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:33.120]   Now, if you're with some people, and you don't think that they actually care about
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.080]   you, but there's no way you can trust them or to believe them.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.840]   Yeah, sure, they can be all powerful, they can do all these wonderful and great things.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:50.360]   But really, it's got nothing to do with you, because, well, he doesn't care about you.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:56.520]   So the second thing that we must also believe is that we must believe he cares about us.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:02.840]   Now, one of the crucial part about having faith in God and a peaceful mind is to know
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.440]   how much Jesus deeply cares about you.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.360]   And just like when we have communion just now, it was a remembrance that he loved us
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:21.440]   so much that he went on to the cross for us to die for all of our sins.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:28.240]   And so as the Bible tells us how much he loves us, that's the truth that we need to believe
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.960]   in, but not the circumstances that we see.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.280]   But in here, we actually see the disciples' emotions.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.480]   What were their emotions in this verse?
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:45.760]   Well, actually, to me, it seemed like they were more irritated and frustrated and grumbling
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.160]   and even blaming Jesus than they were scared.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.080]   So we might think, how come?
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:58.560]   Well, I mean, if we think about it, I mean, after all, didn't all their disciples just
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.200]   left their home?
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:07.520]   They left everything to follow him, but they didn't expect him to be, what, sleeping while
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.280]   they were dying and drowning.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.760]   And too often, we too hold the greatest grudges against God.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:23.280]   When we see that, he has the ability, but he's not helping us in our situation.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.400]   And you know what's even worse?
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.720]   It's worse when we think we're a dedicated Christian.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.560]   Like if you have been going to church for many years or if you've been reading the Bible
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.840]   or if you're on the worship team, not picking on you guys, worship team, or like a church
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:46.160]   staff or even a pastor or attending Bible school, you know, the more we think we have
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:56.000]   invested in Jesus and in God and the more delay or it seemed like if Jesus is sleeping
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.840]   during your problem, we start to actually be grumbling like the disciples too.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:10.560]   And I just wanted to say as much as we feel these emotions, the fact is the Bible tells
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:17.160]   us that Jesus does care about us because he came for us and he would never forsake us
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.400]   and he even gave us eternal life.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.480]   And that's the truth.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:30.800]   And so it's a battle for us to trust God when the situation seems to be really bad.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:37.400]   And or even the delay of his help, we need to trust him and his words.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.640]   And the fact is the Bible tells us that Jesus cares about us.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:47.440]   It's written all over the Bible in the Old Testament, in the New Testament.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:56.140]   And so much, this cannot just stay as a head knowledge, but it must speak to our heart.
[00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:04.720]   And when we forget, we need to remind ourselves in the midst of our troubles that Jesus cares.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:11.240]   Now as we read on, we see that Jesus calmed the wind and the sea and actually he turned
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.860]   to them and he asked them, why are you afraid?
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:20.160]   Have you still no faith?
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.560]   Now the Greek word here for afraid is actually Delos.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.000]   It's a different kind of afraid, it's not really that fear because it's appeared only
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.720]   three times in the Bible.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.640]   And this word actually means little faith.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.640]   So he's literally saying, why are you having so little faith?
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   Have you got no faith?
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.240]   And this is one of the questions where we're going like, Jesus, how come you're asking
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.240]   this question?
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.880]   Well, let's see why I have no faith.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:55.540]   Well, the boat is breaking and we're drowning and dying and you're asking this question.
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.400]   It's almost seemed like if it weren't Jesus asking, we'll be a little bit annoyed.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.600]   But we know that Jesus doesn't ask questions without a good reason.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.360]   There's something more that Jesus is asking.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:13.400]   Now we've already established in the first point that they didn't really see Jesus as
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:19.360]   God, and that's part of the reason why they're having so much trouble in having faith in
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   him.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.240]   But what else is hindering them from having faith?
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.360]   Now Jesus could well be asking you the same question.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.520]   How come when you've read the Bible, you believe in God and now we even know he is resurrected,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.840]   so we have more information than the disciples.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:47.240]   But when we are faced with really tough situations, why do you not have faith?
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:57.080]   And can you type in the chat box, why is it that we have no faith during that time?
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.640]   It's quite a profound question.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:04.480]   I actually asked myself this and I tried to answer it.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.040]   It's quite hard.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   Okay, so far I've seen no answers come in yet.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:23.400]   But what I think that Jesus is trying to get at, oh yes, we underestimate God, good.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.760]   And we overestimate man.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.200]   These are the answers I'm seeing in our chat box.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.560]   And because we only see our circumstances, great.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.600]   No close relationship with God.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:45.000]   And it's easy to look at our circumstances and forget about Jesus.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.360]   Yes, and these are great answers.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.680]   And I do think so too.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:58.640]   And there is one where I think Jesus is trying to get at, which is for them, they didn't
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.240]   have a personal encounter with God.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:07.040]   And I think somebody here also said no personal relationship with God.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.280]   Now as it is narrated in the later part, they said that they were terrified and they asked
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.760]   each other, who is this?
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.880]   Even the wind and the waves obey him.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:24.460]   And they were just beginning to have more revelation of who Jesus is.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:34.960]   So this comes to our third point, which is we need to personally encounter God.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.280]   Now think about this, who is this miracle for?
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:41.280]   Well it was for the disciples.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.160]   And what was the purpose of this miracle?
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:52.000]   Because Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee and he was away from the crowd.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.120]   He was only with his disciples and they could have just crossed smoothly across to the other
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.480]   side.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.680]   What was the purpose of this miracle?
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:10.440]   It was actually to allow the disciples to know who he is through a very personal encounter.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:16.120]   Now because at the end of the miracle, the disciples had new revelation and they also
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:22.980]   have experienced God and they were no longer seeing him as someone who healed other people.
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:29.040]   He was no longer seeing Jesus as someone who cast out demons for others, but they were
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:37.480]   seeing him as the one right before their eyes, able to calm down the wind and the sea and
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.620]   the wind and the sea obeyed him.
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.700]   He was able to save them.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:49.420]   So they were able to experience all of that, God's timing and helping them.
[00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:55.900]   It wasn't immediate, but when they called him, he, they, when they called him, he answered
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:00.120]   and they were able to experience his care and his power.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.320]   They were able to be challenged by Jesus right there about their faith.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:12.580]   They were able to come to a personal revelation and this they wouldn't have done if they haven't
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.660]   had a personal encounter with God.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.200]   They would have just crossed without anything happening.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.040]   And are we like that too?
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.040]   We've heard about Jesus.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:30.000]   We might have even read a lot about him, but sometimes he might not be a personal God to
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   us.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   He is God.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.480]   He is good, but he seems to be somewhere far helping others, but not necessarily you.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:46.820]   And until we have encountered him personally and seen him active in our lives, in our problems,
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:52.960]   he could just stay there being an impersonal God or even just a teacher and our faith would
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.220]   be very limited.
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:03.020]   Now as his disciples built this deeper relationship with him and got to experience him more, their
[00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.680]   faith grew.
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.740]   And until the very end, we actually see in later parts of the new Testament, they had
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:17.380]   so much faith that many miracles were performed through them and God used them greatly.
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.860]   So this is actually great news for us because if we are like the disciples too, when we
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:29.380]   doubted at times of hardship or when we're slow to realize who he is, but we can see
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:37.420]   that through many personal relationship and encounter with him, we're actually allowing
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:43.580]   God to reveal himself to us and we too can become faithful disciples.
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.140]   So we have a lot of hope.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:53.220]   And sometimes we get so bogged down by the situation itself, we miss out on what's the
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.020]   most precious thing, which is God himself.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:04.740]   To be able to live life with God, even through the hardships, even to struggle with him or
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:12.860]   even be a bit angry with him and then to rely on him and to be challenged by him.
[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.820]   That is precious.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:25.380]   And so we too need to know him personally and encounter him in order for our faith to
[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.540]   grow.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:33.780]   Now some months ago, I learned about a little boy and he's around three right now.
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:39.020]   And he has been battling with cancer for the last year and a half.
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:45.340]   And just a week ago, we found out that he might not be able to make it anytime.
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:53.740]   Now the tumor got so big that it was pressing on his urethra and he wasn't able to urinate
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:57.620]   and he was hospitalized the last two weeks.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:03.340]   And I remember just thinking about him and I was starting to tear up and just thinking
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:10.340]   about how this three-year-old boy who has to suffer the pain of chemo, not being able
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:18.300]   to urinate and this little body, and especially if you've been a parent, to have to go through
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:23.740]   this kind of a sickness in 50% of his life.
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.900]   And the suffering is for both him and the parents.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:35.820]   And to our human minds, it begs the question, God, can't you do something?
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.140]   Don't you care?
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:44.100]   And the parents are also Christians to have them been praying for him.
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:50.620]   And as we got to talk to the dad like two days ago on Thursday, a sister and I were
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.640]   able to pray for them.
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.320]   And I really wasn't sure how to pray because he was so sick.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.920]   And I had prepared actually two children's books in my backpack.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:07.880]   One of it that introduced who Jesus was, and another that talked about what heaven is like
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.720]   to prepare him for it.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:16.040]   And I was afraid to pray too optimistically, because then maybe they'll be disappointed
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.800]   at the outcome if it's not favorable.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:28.480]   But then a thought came into my mind, and it seemed to ask me, who is it that you believe
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.480]   in?
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:35.080]   And to me, the answer was plain and simple.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:41.760]   The God of the universe, who has authority on heaven and on earth.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.920]   He who loves us so much that he sent Jesus to die for us.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:53.220]   The one who loves this little one and his family.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:57.440]   So I knew right there how to pray.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:04.680]   Not with full assurance of what the outcome would be, but with full assurance of who God
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.640]   is.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.280]   And so we started praying for him.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:19.720]   And before we did that, I asked the dad, what would you like Jesus to do for you?
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:26.840]   And he said, he isn't asking for God to necessarily cure him, but he just wanted more time with
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.600]   the boy.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.860]   And so I said, that's the direction we'll pray.
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.800]   And the gist of the prayer went something like this.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:43.840]   Dear heavenly father, the God of the universe, the one who has authority on heaven and earth,
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:51.280]   the one who loves us so much that you gave your son to us, Jesus, you love us and this
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.080]   little boy and his family.
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.600]   We know that you're listening right here and you're with us.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:04.400]   And we pray that you will give this boy more time with his family.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.360]   But we'll leave the outcome into your hands.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.960]   In Jesus Christ name we pray.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.320]   Amen.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:18.560]   And as an act of faith, I only gave him the book that introduced who Jesus was.
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:25.720]   And I put away this other book, which talked about heaven, and I was planning to refund
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.760]   it because I don't think we'll need it.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.800]   As my act of faith.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:38.320]   Now on Friday, we prayed on Thursday and on Friday, just yesterday, we received this message
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.600]   from his dad.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.000]   Just want to share with you an update.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.600]   Just want to share an update with all of you.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.600]   The little boy's condition is improving.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   He had a major breakthrough today.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:02.560]   In a very literal sense, the tumor that was pressing on his urethra for the last two weeks
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:13.320]   and made him unable to pee, he is now, sorry, the tumor was pressing on his urethra and
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.240]   he was unable to pee for two weeks now.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:23.320]   His diaper last night was soaked with urine, which means the tumor must be shrinking and
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.080]   alleviating the pressure.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.160]   Miracles happen and we pray he continues to improve.
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.360]   And I just want to say, hallelujah.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.960]   That is our God.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.600]   Can we all give God a big hand?
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:46.840]   I don't know where you are, but when I heard that, it was the God I know.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:55.640]   So, my dear friends, miracles happen every day because the miracle worker is well and
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.080]   alive.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:03.000]   He healed the lepers, he opened the eyes of the blind, he calmed the sea, and he still
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.600]   does that today because he is God.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:14.280]   Rather or not, you have faith in Jesus, depends on who he is to you.
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.440]   And if you have encountered him personally, you would know this.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.480]   And I encounter him like this all the time.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.040]   So I have a few questions for you.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.080]   Who is Jesus to you?
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.920]   And I want to show these options for you to see for yourself.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.440]   Is he a teacher?
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.120]   A prophet?
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.800]   Someone who might be God?
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.920]   Or he is God?
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.120]   Who is Jesus to you?
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.760]   And you don't have to answer in the chat box.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:52.760]   Just answer in your heart.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:59.040]   And the second question I want to ask you is, does he care about you?
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.520]   Do you know for sure that he cares about you?
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.200]   Is it maybe?
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.400]   A little bit?
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.760]   Sometimes?
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.200]   Always?
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.640]   All the time?
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.960]   What is it?
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.280]   Do you think he cares about you all the time?
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.840]   That's another question for you to answer.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:29.760]   And the third question that I want to ask you is, have you invited him into your daily
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.480]   life?
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   Maybe a little?
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.920]   Sometimes?
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.840]   Or depends on what?
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.520]   Or always?
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.760]   All the time?
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.280]   Do you invite him into your daily lives?
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.720]   Rather, there are things that you don't care.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:51.960]   So you're like, all right, I'll leave that to God.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.520]   Or things that you really care.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.800]   Do you invite him into your daily life?
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:07.440]   Now, all these questions are for you to answer.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:15.320]   Because how you answer these questions will determine what happens to you.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:19.040]   And how you encounter our God.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:24.800]   Are you willing to decide today and firmly tell yourself and the world that Jesus is
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:32.440]   God and he loves you and cares for you all the time, anytime?
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:38.800]   And do you let him take care of you and whatever the outcome may be?
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:44.720]   If you're willing, God will give you faith and peace that you've never felt before.
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.160]   Now, each time you have a problem, make the choice.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.280]   Say no to fear or how bad the situation is.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.600]   Don't zero off on the situation.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.200]   Say yes to him.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.720]   Say yes to his character.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.760]   Say yes, he is God to me.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.040]   He is my God.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.440]   And he loves me.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:06.040]   And leave the outcome to him.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:07.720]   And how do we build more faith?
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:13.360]   And what does it look like to invite God into your everyday life?
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:20.280]   Well, if you've been waiting for some time for a spouse, don't focus on the fact that,
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.160]   oh, I'm getting older.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:28.040]   And there are very few eligible bachelor or bachelorettes at church.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.240]   No.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.160]   Focus on God's word, his character, and his promises.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.680]   And your prayer can look something like this.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.080]   You are the God of the universe.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.440]   And you have authority over everything.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.160]   You love me and you care about me so, so much.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.920]   Please make me a godly person and give me a godly spouse.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:55.360]   And while you're waiting, upgrade yourself, prepare yourself as an act of faith.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.000]   I mean, there might be a few weird things that you're doing.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.960]   So yeah, try to change that.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:08.800]   But leave the outcome to God and have peace, whatever it is that he gives you.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.560]   And experience him, struggle with him, cry with him.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.880]   That is precious.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:20.120]   And while you do that, God will reveal more of himself to you.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.520]   And if you've been waiting for years for your sickness to be healed, don't focus on the
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:30.720]   fact that, "Oh, I've tried this, I've done that, I went to this doctor, I don't think
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.240]   I'm going to get any better."
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.320]   Let's just hope that things don't get worse.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.320]   No.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:40.800]   Focus on God's word, his character, his promise.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:43.400]   And you can pray a prayer like this.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.720]   You are the God of the universe.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.880]   And you have authority over everything.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.320]   You love me and you care for me.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:58.160]   Please help me know how to eat, which doctor to go to, and take away my sickness.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   And while you're waiting, eat healthy, take the medicine you need to as an act of faith,
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.960]   and let God have the outcome and have peace.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.440]   Enjoy him in the process.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.640]   And I know if these things sounds like, "Oh, these are too hard.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.760]   These are too big for me."
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.560]   Start with the smaller stuff.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:23.240]   You can pray for God to help you with your project that you're working on, the exam that
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:28.520]   you'll be taking next week, or just trying to catch the minibus that you always miss,
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.760]   or with your baking as if it always goes bad, and with your tennis match.
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.480]   Now, I'm not sure if both of you are praying at the same time who will win, or maybe one
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.480]   match per person.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:45.600]   But what I mean is, invite God to be a part of your everyday life.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:52.280]   Start with the small things and build that trust so that when you're faced with big problems,
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.000]   you'll remember, "He has done this for me, and that was how I could also pray because
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.200]   I remember he has done so much for me.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.220]   I know I can pray on his character."
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:11.880]   And allow him to work every single issue or happy things in your life because he wants
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:14.280]   to be your personal God.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.840]   And that's how we're going to have faith.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.840]   And you know, this is like a snowball effect.
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:25.720]   The more you allow him to be in your life, the more you pronounce his goodness and who
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.920]   he is, the more faith you have.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:33.760]   Remember the sister who was praying with me for the dad of the little boy?
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:42.120]   After we saw the miracle that happened, she messaged me, and then she told me, "You know
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   what?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:49.680]   Even as impossible as it may seem to our earthly standpoint, I think we have nothing to lose
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:56.280]   in terms of being bold in our prayers and praying for full recovery for the boy."
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.360]   I don't know what the outcome would be, but you see that?
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.560]   That's faith growing.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.480]   And I knew right there that both of our faith and all of our faith that has been hearing
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.880]   this testimony right now, our faith are growing.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.920]   And at first, we only dare to pray for more time.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:23.560]   But the revelation and the personal encounter of who Jesus is, is giving us more faith to
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:30.480]   be more bold, not for the outcome, but for who he is.
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.600]   He is our personal God.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.240]   And our prayers would never be the same again.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:40.200]   And we got to know Jesus more and experience him more.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.920]   And then we have more faith.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:47.520]   So whatever it is, say no to fear of your problem.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:53.560]   Are you afraid you won't get into the university you want to go in or get that job you want?
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:35:00.120]   Are you afraid that you may never find the right person to date or get married to?
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:05.560]   Are you afraid that your relationship won't get better and it's dwindling off?
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.400]   Are you afraid that you won't have children?
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.200]   Are you afraid that your children won't get into a good school?
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.040]   Are you afraid your depression or sickness won't go away?
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:20.040]   Are you afraid your children will abandon you as you grow older?
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:28.600]   There are so many things we can fear, but it's time to say no to all that fear and impossibility.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:36.360]   And it's time to say yes to who Jesus is and that he is God.
[00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.560]   He is your savior.
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:45.120]   It's time to say yes to how much he cares about you and remind yourself of his saving
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.120]   grace whenever you doubt.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.760]   And it's time to say yes.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:36:01.720]   We want you in every part of our lives because the moments that we spend with God, they're
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   precious.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   They're precious.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:12.360]   Jesus was only on the boat with his closest disciples and he is with us with every situation
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.000]   that we're in.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:24.200]   That is precious and our faith will continue to grow deeper.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.800]   So let him into your life.
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:35.760]   Invite the way maker, the miracle worker, the promise keeper into your life.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:43.560]   Enjoy the personal relationship with him anytime, whether you're struggling or not.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:51.360]   And start with the small things if the big ones are too hard and let him grow your faith
[00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:58.840]   because he is here, he's working in our midst and he loves you.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.280]   So believe him.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.080]   Let us pray together.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:12.480]   Dear heavenly father, you are our God, regardless of the situation we're in.
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:20.520]   And you are the one who holds the key and authority over demons, over sickness, over
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:28.120]   our circumstances, over nature, over everything.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:36.600]   And father, we just pray that we would have faith like this, not on whatever the outcome
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:45.120]   would be, but on you alone, your character, your presence, and you are on the boat with
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:46.120]   us.
[00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:54.400]   And I pray father, that all of us in this life that we live in, that we get to encounter
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.320]   you every day.
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.800]   And if we do that, it's heaven on earth.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:09.400]   Because that place called heaven, it's only called heaven because you're there.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.480]   And if you're here with us today, it's already heaven.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.080]   We thank you for loving us.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.080]   Help us grow in our faith.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.080]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:18.080]   Amen.
[00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.080]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
