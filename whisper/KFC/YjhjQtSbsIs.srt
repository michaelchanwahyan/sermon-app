1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,800
 Yes, I know that I use the expression "I am excited" a lot.

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:22,440
 And I understand that there is a danger of this that you don't take me seriously.

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:34,120
 But when I say I'm excited about One 2022, I'm going to ask you to take me at face value.

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:42,040
 I mean, why wouldn't I be excited when an idea that started here in this church has

5
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,000
 spread to around 500 churches in our city alone?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,760
 Why wouldn't I be excited when an idea that started here in this church has spread to

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:02,760
 32 cities worldwide with over 10,000 churches involved?

8
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,280
 Why wouldn't I be excited when this week I've had the opportunity to be a speaker on behalf

9
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,040
 of Godfrey Church to address both the global launch and the Hong Kong launch?

10
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:22,400
 Why wouldn't I be excited when all around the world Christians will be listening to

11
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,480
 John's Gospels and the epistles together in their mother tongues?

12
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:35,640
 Why wouldn't I be excited when churches all around the world will be preaching the seven

13
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,600
 I am's of Jesus at the same time?

14
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,440
 Why wouldn't I be excited when small groups like our clans all around the world will be

15
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,760
 studying the seven I am's at the same time?

16
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,560
 Why wouldn't I be excited when Christians all around the world will be watching the

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,840
 seven miracles of Jesus from John's Gospel over the next seven weeks?

18
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,640
 And I'm not the only one excited.

19
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:17,840
 I'm going to show you now a clip from Pastor Randy Frazee from Westside Family Church in

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,760
 Kansas City where I preached last year who is spearheading this global initiative.

21
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,280
 And I apologize in advance for any sound quality, but it'd be good for us to hear this.

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
 Thank you, Anthony.

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,160
 Well, hello, Pastor John and Sandra, the beautiful people of Kong Fok Church and the amazing brothers

24
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,040
 and sisters in Hong Kong.

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,980
 Randy Frazee here.

26
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,680
 You know, it was your vision that created one.

27
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,160
 Yeah, several years ago, you guys created this vision that the churches in your city

28
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,040
 would unite together to make the name of Jesus more famous.

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,560
 You also probably know this, that that vision you created, you birthed, has spread now worldwide

30
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,280
 to 32 major cities around the world, including Kansas City, where I'm at.

31
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,120
 And for that, we are very grateful.

32
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,920
 This is not just year one for us.

33
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,740
 This is year two.

34
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,840
 It was actually Pastor John's vision that we would go through the Gospel of John together.

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,960
 And on Sunday mornings, we would all teach around the world through the seven powerful

36
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,280
 I Am statements of Jesus, in addition to collecting in small watching groups and this amazing

37
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,600
 listening plan.

38
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,600
 So we're super excited and honored to partner with you in this journey.

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,360
 And please know that the believers in Kansas City are praying for you, that God would go

40
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,200
 before you and behind you on either side of you to make this journey together very successful

41
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,160
 for the sake of the kingdom.

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,500
 Blessings and Godspeed.

43
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,680
 Pastor Randy, that's exciting.

44
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:00,320
 And tonight I get the excitement, the privilege of kicking it off here in Hong Kong at KFCI

45
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,840
 by preaching an introductory sermon.

46
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:12,760
 Now because of our time zone and because we have service on Saturday and not Sunday, we

47
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:20,680
 will be the first of the 10,000 plus churches to hear this message.

48
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,680
 This is a rose.

49
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,920
 Well, I imagine it's a rose because there's a famous line in a play by William Shakespeare,

50
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:37,560
 Romeo and Juliet, and it's said by Juliet, she says this, "What's in a name?

51
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:48,720
 That which we call a rose by any other name would still smell as sweet."

52
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:57,680
 She is suggesting that if we were to call a rose, say a rock, it would still smell as

53
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
 sweet.

54
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:05,440
 But we are not defined by our names, that our names are meaningless.

55
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,960
 Now what do you think about that?

56
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,040
 Well let me tell you my story.

57
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,880
 I've mentioned this before.

58
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,240
 My name was not originally meant to be John.

59
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,160
 It was meant to be George.

60
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,880
 I was born on what is known in the UK as St. George's Day, April the 23rd.

61
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,880
 Now St. George is a highly celebrated saint in both the Western and Eastern Christian

62
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,640
 churches.

63
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,120
 And George is the patron saint of England.

64
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,160
 If you look at the English national flag, it is actually the St. George's cross.

65
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,280
 And that features within the Union flag of the United Kingdom and other national flags

66
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,000
 that contain the Union flag, such as Australia and New Zealand.

67
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,280
 But in the 14th century, the saint had been declared both the patron saint and the protector

68
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,760
 of the royal family.

69
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,400
 The legend around him was that he had slayed a dragon.

70
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,240
 But George wasn't to be my handle.

71
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,640
 The meaning of George is actually farmer.

72
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,360
 Farmer.

73
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:31,440
 Sorry to our George Barlow, who is a perfectly respectable radiologist, and any other Georges.

74
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,600
 But I mean a connection between me and farming just does not exist.

75
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,480
 I mean farmers can be stung by dangerous insects.

76
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,560
 Farmers can work with heavy machinery which can kill or injure them.

77
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,720
 And farmers can establish muscle and joint pains from repeated work.

78
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 I say no thanks.

79
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,960
 Back to George.

80
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:01,680
 My dad, my father, who was 51 at the time, and ecstatic about having his first and only

81
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:11,200
 son decided to have a drink or two or more, and promptly went out to name me John Henry

82
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,840
 Snelgrove, the same as him.

83
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,400
 I guess if I was American, I'd be John Henry Snelgrove the second.

84
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:27,320
 And just let me say the name of John has nothing to do with a toilet or a male visitor to a

85
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:36,680
 house of ill repute, but actually means God is gracious.

86
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,880
 How about that?

87
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:47,880
 However, research seems to suggest that your name does have some impact on your life.

88
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,080
 Let me just share a few.

89
00:07:51,080 --> 00:08:00,400
 They tell me that if your name is easy to pronounce, people will favor you more.

90
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:10,040
 I found that Snelgrove has confounded most people in Hong Kong for 35 years, which is

91
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:20,880
 why almost everybody calls me John or Snelly, or even uses my Chinese name of Snelgrove.

92
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,760
 Apparently if your name is common, you are more likely to be hired.

93
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:33,080
 Maybe that's why I've only managed to have three employers in my lifetime.

94
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,320
 They tell me if your name is closer to the beginning of the alphabet, apparently you

95
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,440
 can get into a better school.

96
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:50,120
 On the other hand, if your last name is closer to the end of the alphabet, they tell me that

97
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
 you're more likely to be an impulsive shopper.

98
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,960
 I don't know about that.

99
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,960
 But we do judge people by their names.

100
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,120
 Let me give you an example.

101
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,320
 If you got dumped by a boy called Michael or a girl called Tammy in high school or college,

102
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:16,880
 you will cast a negative judgment on every Michael or Tammy you meet.

103
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,360
 So why am I telling you this?

104
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,160
 What is in a name?

105
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:30,880
 Well today as we begin this new series, Jesus is going to reveal his name.

106
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:39,640
 And what we will see is this, that some people are definitely going to judge him for it.

107
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:47,680
 For others of us, this name means good news.

108
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:55,000
 Let's turn to our Bibles and to John chapter 8.

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,080
 The Jews answered him, "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a

110
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,160
 demon?"

111
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:13,760
 Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon, but I honor my father and you dishonor me.

112
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,160
 Yet I do not seek my own glory.

113
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,360
 There is one who seeks it and he is the judge."

114
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:33,720
 "Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."

115
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,520
 The Jews said to him, "Now we know you have a demon.

116
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,680
 Abraham died, as did the prophets.

117
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,880
 Yet you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.'

118
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,640
 Are you greater than our father Abraham who died?

119
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,480
 And the prophets died.

120
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,240
 Who do you make yourself out to be?"

121
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,240
 Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.

122
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:14,720
 It is my father who glorifies me, of whom you say he is our God.

123
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,120
 But you have not known him.

124
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,640
 I know him.

125
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,240
 If I were to say that I do not know him, I would be like a liar to you.

126
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,800
 But I do know him and I keep his word.

127
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,740
 Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day.

128
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,360
 He saw it and was glad."

129
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,880
 So the Jews said to him, "You're not even 50 years old.

130
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,200
 Have you seen Abraham?"

131
00:11:51,200 --> 00:12:02,200
 Jesus said to them, this is the key line, "Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham

132
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,960
 was, I am."

133
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:17,040
 So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the

134
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,400
 temple.

135
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,760
 Let me tell you the story.

136
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:30,240
 Jesus has just gotten up into all the business of the Jewish religious leaders.

137
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,120
 He has challenged them that they belong to the devil and don't believe in him because

138
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,280
 they don't believe in God.

139
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,000
 Ouch.

140
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,800
 Now Jesus has definitely not read Dal Carnegie's bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence

141
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,360
 People.

142
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:58,320
 And in John 8, 48, they answered him, "Are we right in saying that you're a Samaritan

143
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,040
 and have a demon?

144
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,500
 That's a punch below the belt.

145
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,960
 You know, we've had this before, that Jews despised the Samaritans and looked down on

146
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
 them.

147
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,560
 You know that Jesus was not a Samaritan.

148
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:25,040
 A Samaritan was a half-breed, half-Jewish, half-Greek, but Jesus was full on Jewish and

149
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,780
 he is certainly not demon possessed.

150
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,200
 So Jesus denies their claims.

151
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:41,380
 And then he says this, "Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never

152
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,960
 see death."

153
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,940
 Now they respond to that.

154
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,300
 Now we know, now we know that you are demon possessed.

155
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:58,060
 Abraham died and so did all the prophets.

156
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,660
 But if someone believes in you, they will not see death.

157
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,380
 That's pure craziness.

158
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:14,500
 Then they pose this question with the attitude, "Who do you think you are?"

159
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,180
 And Jesus responds, listen carefully to what he says.

160
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,500
 Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.

161
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,620
 It is my father who glorifies me, of whom you say he is our God.

162
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,620
 But you have not known him.

163
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,140
 I know him.

164
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,140
 If I were to say that I did not know him, I would be a liar to you.

165
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,900
 But I do know him and I keep his word.

166
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:47,900
 Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day.

167
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,340
 He saw it and was glad.

168
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,220
 Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day.

169
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,460
 He saw it and was glad."

170
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,420
 This blows their minds.

171
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,220
 He is saying that Abraham saw Jesus.

172
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,120
 Now what does he mean by that?

173
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,980
 He means that when God came to Abraham and promised that the Messiah would come from

174
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:27,140
 his seed, his family, that he believed God and saw it by faith, Jesus is that promised

175
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,820
 Messiah.

176
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,620
 These guys are starting to catch Jesus' drip and challenge him.

177
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:42,860
 They say Abraham has been gone for over 2,000 years and yet Jesus is not even 50.

178
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:48,340
 He was actually 31 or 32 years old at this point.

179
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,140
 And they make a good point.

180
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,620
 Then Jesus lays it on them in verse 58.

181
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,940
 Let's read it together.

182
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:13,100
 "Jesus said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.'"

183
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:21,380
 Now according to my calculations, Jesus would have needed to have been born more than 2,197

184
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,020
 years ago to be here before Abraham.

185
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,780
 But Jesus is not saying he was there before Abraham.

186
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:34,220
 Otherwise, he would have said, "Before Abraham was, I was."

187
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:42,940
 No, he said, "Before Abraham was, I am."

188
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:49,380
 It means that Jesus wasn't born but has always existed.

189
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,180
 He has no origin.

190
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,500
 He has always been.

191
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,900
 So what was their response to this statement?

192
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,940
 Check out the next verse.

193
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:11,420
 So they picked up the stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the

194
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,460
 temple.

195
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:24,460
 Okay, what was it that Jesus said that made them want to stone him?

196
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:32,340
 Now to discover this, we have to go back into the second book of the Old Testament, Exodus

197
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,020
 chapter 3.

198
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,020
 This is Moses.

199
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:45,460
 Moses said to God, "Who am I that should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel

200
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,460
 out of Egypt?"

201
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:58,500
 He said, "But I will be with you, and this shall be a sign for you that I have sent you.

202
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:06,900
 When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."

203
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,820
 And Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your

204
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:21,460
 fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?'

205
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,580
 What shall I say to them?"

206
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:33,780
 God said to Moses, "I am who I am."

207
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,420
 And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel.

208
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,180
 I am has sent me to you."

209
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,660
 So let's go back to the Exodus story.

210
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:53,340
 Israel, the Hebrew people, have been in Egypt now for 400 years.

211
00:18:53,340 --> 00:19:02,260
 They currently find themselves in a horrific, demoralizing state of slavery.

212
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,980
 Moses had been gone from Egypt for 40 years.

213
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,020
 Remember he had killed an Egyptian.

214
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:17,220
 He is hanging out in the desert as a shepherd with his family, minding his own business.

215
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,820
 And then God visits Moses and speaks to him from a burning bush.

216
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,220
 I mean, that would certainly get your attention.

217
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:35,660
 God tells Moses that he wants him to trek back into Egypt and to tell Pharaoh, to say

218
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:41,220
 to Pharaoh, "You can say it with me, 'Let my people go.'"

219
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:51,280
 And Moses says back to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children

220
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,900
 of Israel out of Egypt?"

221
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,580
 I mean, he's saying, "Who am I?"

222
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,020
 He was given the name Moses by Pharaoh's daughter.

223
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,940
 And that literally means, Moses means pulled out of the water.

224
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,540
 You remember he was taken out of the river Jordan as a baby.

225
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,940
 But what's in a name?

226
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,220
 I'm going back to the beginning now.

227
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:22,300
 Moses is saying to God, "My name means pulled out of the water, which I was.

228
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,580
 And I'm grateful because it saved my life.

229
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,980
 But I don't think that's going to do it with Pharaoh."

230
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,780
 And God says, "I will be with you."

231
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,860
 I love Moses' response.

232
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,820
 Then Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God

233
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:49,140
 of my fathers has sent me to you,' and they ask me, 'What is his name?'

234
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,340
 What shall I say to them?"

235
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:56,300
 Now listen carefully to God's response back to Moses.

236
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:06,180
 God said to Moses, "I am who I am."

237
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,380
 God said to Moses, "I am who I am."

238
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:21,980
 And he said, "Say this to the people of Israel, 'I am has sent me to you.'"

239
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,940
 Now what kind of name is that?

240
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,740
 What it means is this.

241
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,140
 God has always existed.

242
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:37,100
 That he doesn't come from someone else like we do.

243
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:43,260
 He has always been, always is, and always will be.

244
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,780
 The uncaused cause, self-existence.

245
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,700
 I am is present tense.

246
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,420
 God has no past, present, or future.

247
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,060
 This is mind-blowing.

248
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:07,420
 Everything we think about God is now.

249
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:14,540
 Everything that God is prophesying for the future, we are waiting on, but he is not waiting

250
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,180
 on anything.

251
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,020
 It means that God is eternal.

252
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:26,500
 He has no beginning, and he has no end.

253
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:34,460
 And God repeats himself, but shortened his title by simply referring to himself as "I

254
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
 am."

255
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,820
 "Tell them I am has sent you."

256
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:46,580
 Now interestingly, "I am" in Hebrew is just four letters without vowels.

257
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,740
 They're all consonants.

258
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:56,580
 The Hebrew language didn't add vowels until the 10th century by a group of people called

259
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,540
 the Mazarites.

260
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:04,060
 It makes learning this language very, very difficult.

261
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:13,900
 It's what we call a tetragrammaton, which means that YHWH is a four-letter word.

262
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:21,460
 In Hebrew, it looks like this.

263
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:30,180
 In English, it looks like this.

264
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,500
 Does anyone recognize this?

265
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:41,140
 Out of the nearly 1,000 names for God in the Bible, this is the one that stands out above

266
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,820
 them all.

267
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,820
 YHWH.

268
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,340
 We just sang it, didn't we?

269
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,380
 YHWH, YHWH, we love to hear your name, oh Lord.

270
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,980
 It is also pronounced Jehovah.

271
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:02,860
 Throughout the Old Testament, whenever YHWH appears out of respect for the loftiness of

272
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:14,020
 his name, Jewish tradition typically replaces YHWH or inserts the name Adonai.

273
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,420
 It appears in our Bibles as Lord.

274
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,380
 If you read the Bible, you'll see that Lord is usually in capitals.

275
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,820
 YHWH, his name.

276
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,140
 I just got a small observation here.

277
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,180
 Moses created all this trouble before God about the name.

278
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,180
 Actually, when he goes to the Hebrew people, they never even ask for his name.

279
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,660
 Okay, heading back to Jesus.

280
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:54,300
 Jesus is saying that he is the great I am.

281
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,880
 That's why they picked up stones to kill him.

282
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,860
 This was in keeping with the Old Testament law found in Leviticus 24.

283
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,380
 It says this, "Take the blasphemer out of the camp.

284
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:15,260
 All those who heard him lay their hands on his head and let all the congregation stone

285
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
 him."

286
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,860
 So, the punishment for blasphemy was stoning.

287
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,620
 But it's not blasphemy if it's true.

288
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,180
 But it is true.

289
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:36,100
 Jesus is I am.

290
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,600
 I want to finish this afternoon by looking at what it means for us.

291
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,140
 What does it mean for us today?

292
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,540
 What is his application?

293
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,620
 I think at least four things come to mind.

294
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:57,820
 One is this, is that Jesus is God.

295
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,100
 Jesus is not mere man.

296
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
 And that's important.

297
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,100
 Now, why is it important?

298
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:15,720
 Well, if Jesus was born of the seed of Joseph, we are in big trouble because we are still

299
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,220
 in our sin.

300
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,220
 Why?

301
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:24,660
 Because Joseph, like you and me, are born of Adam and Eve's sin nature and it's automatically

302
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:27,780
 passed down to us.

303
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,460
 Jesus' sacrifice upon the cross, while noble and thoughtful, would not have paid for our

304
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,020
 sins once and for all.

305
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:46,260
 That's why Jesus had to be born of a virgin from the seed of the Holy Spirit.

306
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:57,900
 He knew no sin and therefore his sacrifice is perfect and sufficient to remove our sin.

307
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,700
 So that's number one, Jesus is God.

308
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,980
 Secondly, Jesus saves.

309
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:12,660
 Back in Exodus, Yahweh kept his promise and led the children of Israel out of slavery

310
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:18,980
 across the Red Sea and ultimately into the Promised Land.

311
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:25,100
 Jesus' name in Hebrew is Yeshua.

312
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,980
 In Hebrew, Yeshua means Yahweh saves.

313
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:39,300
 Can you see this progression from Jesus to Yeshua to Yahweh saves?

314
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:47,940
 Yeshua leads us out of slavery to sin and ultimately into the Promised Land of eternity

315
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:55,140
 in his new kingdom, where we will be with him forever and ever.

316
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:59,380
 Thirdly, Jesus is present.

317
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,020
 Jesus is not a character we read about in a history book.

318
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,380
 The I Am is forever present.

319
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,820
 He is with you.

320
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:15,500
 He is with us right now.

321
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:24,660
 The best time to experience the I Am-ness of Jesus is when life is not making any sense.

322
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:33,660
 I've got to say in a week like we've just had, it is the best time for us to experience

323
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:43,300
 the I Am-ness of Jesus when you've lost a sense of who you are.

324
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:51,580
 And lastly, point number four, is that Jesus will give us his name.

325
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:58,180
 In Revelation 22, is given a vision of our life in the new kingdom.

326
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:11,380
 John says this, "They will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads."

327
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,460
 It looks like I don't have to walk around anymore trying to make something out of my

328
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:22,820
 name meaning God is gracious, John, and not Father George.

329
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:35,100
 The truth is, I will have the name of Jesus proudly tattooed across my forehead and it

330
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:49,100
 will signal to everyone, including myself, that I belong here.

331
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:55,420
 The name Jesus is powerful.

332
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,740
 He is the great I Am.

333
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:05,500
 And tonight, he wants to do a tattoo job on you.

334
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,180
 I'm going to pray for you now.

335
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,380
 And I'm going to be praying that you would know, that you would know, that you would

336
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,380
 know this.

337
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:19,420
 That you would know the great I Am, that Jesus is God, that Jesus saves, that Jesus

338
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:29,940
 is present, and that Jesus is willing to give you his name.

339
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,460
 Are you willing to receive his name this evening?

340
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:44,780
 Are we willing to receive his name and take it to the world, to be hope for the world

341
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,380
 at a time like this?

342
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:54,540
 Let me pray for you and then what we're going to do together, we're going to declare that

343
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,700
 he is the great I Am.

344
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,340
 Let's pray together.

345
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:09,780
 Jesus, we thank you that you are the great I Am.

346
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:15,820
 As we go through this Lent time together, as we study the I Am statement, I pray that

347
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,580
 tonight Lord, that you would write your name on our foreheads.

348
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,820
 And Lord, we open ourselves now.

349
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:29,220
 Maybe just take this time, just hold your hands in front of you and say, "Lord, I receive

350
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,820
 your name.

351
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:42,820
 I receive the name of Jesus Christ, my Savior, my King, and my God, in Jesus' name.

352
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,740
 Amen.
