[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   Let's just wave.
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.640]   Yeah, it's great to be here.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.800]   Tonight we'll be continuing our series
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.920]   on women in the Old Testament.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.200]   So we've looked through a few stories already
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.240]   on Eve and Rebecca,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.040]   and last week we looked at Leah and Rachel,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.080]   and today we're gonna be looking at the life of Miriam.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.280]   Now, not a lot of women have been noted in the Bible.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.760]   Now, there are even fewer that has prominent roles,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.760]   and yet Miriam was noted to be the very first prophetess
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.160]   in the Bible.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.880]   So there's a lot of things that we can learn about her,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.720]   and today we'll be learning about how or what is it
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.320]   that it means to be faithful to God,
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.760]   and we're gonna learn actually both through her strengths
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.880]   as well as her weaknesses.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.240]   So what is, I mean, who is Miriam anyway?
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.240]   Well, she is better known as the sister of Moses and Aaron
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.720]   who led the Israelites out from Egypt into the Promised Land.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.320]   So her name really means beloved
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.440]   if it's with the sound in Egypt,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.520]   or the star of the sea,
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.120]   or sea of bitterness in the word Hebrew.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.160]   And so we're gonna see a little bit
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.000]   of all of those characteristics playing out tonight.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.720]   And she came from a family of a priest,
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.200]   so she came from quite a godly family,
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.440]   or that's the context of it.
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.320]   So now the first appearance of her in the Bible
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.760]   is actually in Exodus, verse two, one to 10.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.480]   Now, at that time, she was actually the unnamed sister,
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.880]   so she's not given a name at that time,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.240]   but with the process of elimination,
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.120]   Moses only had one sister, so we know that it's Miriam.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.440]   And so at that time, what happened
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.200]   was that the Israelites were oppressed
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.480]   and they were living in the land of Egypt,
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   and they were living actually as slaves.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.320]   And so because their population grew so much
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.520]   that Pharaoh wanted to limit their numbers.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.840]   So what he planned, or what he said is that
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.840]   to have all of the baby boys put to death when they're born,
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.640]   and that's the command that he gave
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.480]   to the midwives of the Hebrews.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.360]   But the Hebrew midwives feared the Lord,
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.640]   so then they did not listen to him
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.200]   and instead allowed the baby boys to continue on.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.880]   So Pharaoh found out that his plan wasn't working out,
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.600]   so instead he said, "Let's get all of the baby boys
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.440]   "and throw them into the Nile River
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.160]   "to be killed and drowned."
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.160]   And so this is the time when Moses was born.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.400]   And so when he was born, he was kept for three months,
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.640]   and eventually his mother could no longer keep him
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.400]   'cause he was probably quite big.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.320]   And so he put him in a basket,
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   and then he put it among the reeds in the Nile River.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.160]   And so this is the first account,
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.480]   and let's just read it together.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.640]   I'll read it to you.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.400]   This is in Exodus chapter 2, 78.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.560]   It says here, "Then his sister," which is Miriam,
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.400]   "asked Pharaoh's daughter,"
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   because the slave of Pharaoh's daughter found this basket,
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.680]   and she said, Miriam asked her,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.680]   "Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.880]   "to nurse the baby for you?"
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.760]   And she said, "Yes, go," she answered.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   "So the girl went and got the baby's mother.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.480]   "Pharaoh's daughter said to her,
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.080]   "Take this baby and nurse him for me."
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.880]   And, "I will pay you."
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.600]   So the women took the baby and nursed him.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.360]   When the child grew older,
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.440]   she took him to Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.520]   and he became her son.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.520]   She named him Moses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.640]   Now, the very first thing that we can learn from Miriam
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.160]   is how do we be faithful?
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.800]   Well, seeing from her story is to be courageous
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.920]   for the people that you love.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.160]   Well, it's actually extremely courageous
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.600]   for Miriam to be speaking to Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.920]   because remember, she was just a Hebrew slave,
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.000]   and here it is, the Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.400]   this official, this royalty.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.880]   So what it meant was that if she had said anything
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.680]   that the princess did not like,
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.520]   then her life could be in danger.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.240]   But instead, she was courageous enough
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.400]   to go in front of the princess and actually tell her
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.320]   that, "Do you want me to get a nurse for this baby?"
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.840]   Not only was she courageous, but also cunning.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.360]   Now, this kind of courage is not like one
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.840]   where we'll eat a type of exotic food,
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.840]   like a fried insect, or not even going up to your crush
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.200]   and asking them out for a date kind of courage, right?
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.000]   'Cause those ones don't cause your life.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.800]   But this kind is the one where you're going on a bungee jump
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.680]   and you're not quite sure the rope won't break,
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.240]   but if it does, you're gonna die.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.800]   So this is the kind of courage that she had.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.480]   And remember what her age was, most likely just above six,
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   'cause I think anything younger,
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.960]   the princess probably wouldn't take her seriously,
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.080]   and probably somewhere less than 12 years old,
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.920]   otherwise she would already have been an adolescent.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.120]   So imagine for that to happen.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.840]   I mean, it's easy for us to think
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.840]   that a mother would protect a child,
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.400]   but this is actually quite the reverse.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.160]   It was a child preserving the life of this baby
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.440]   and also for the family.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.840]   And at first I thought, "Well, did she do it for herself?"
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.360]   Mostly, most likely not, because who wants a baby brother?
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.720]   The divided attention of the parent, right?
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.280]   Of course not.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.240]   So she didn't do it for herself,
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.440]   but instead for the loved ones of her.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.360]   And why is it that when we do that,
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.520]   we're actually faithful to God,
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.080]   when we're courageous for our loved ones?
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.400]   Because she had no idea that eventually Moses
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.360]   would be the leader of the Israelites.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.920]   But when she was courageous for those ones that she loved,
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.760]   God actually used her and opened the doors.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.800]   And so I wanted to ask you tonight as well.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   I mean, have you ever been courageous
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.800]   for someone that you love
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:58.240]   and am willing to lay down your life for him or her?
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.240]   Well, recently I've met with some distant relative.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.560]   And how distant are they?
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.440]   Well, I only see them during funerals and weddings.
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.840]   So that's how distant.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.240]   And so I actually was at a funeral
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.840]   of one of my relatives a few weeks ago.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.320]   And when I went, I really had this thought,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.080]   all right, this is the time
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.880]   when I'm gonna seize the opportunity,
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.160]   I'm gonna share the gospel with them.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.400]   And so I was there and I was trying to find a way,
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.760]   but eventually I talked with my aunt and my cousin.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.800]   But honestly, I have to confess,
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.280]   I did not have the courage to mention Jesus to them.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.640]   And I felt really bad afterwards.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.780]   I'm like, oh, when am I gonna get this chance?
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.200]   But the Lord had been good.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.000]   And so He actually opened up an opportunity
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.440]   and someone from our relative said, what's your number?
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.360]   Let's create a WhatsApp group.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.840]   I'm like, okay, this is good.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.480]   So we created a WhatsApp group
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.760]   with like 20 of our relatives there.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.120]   I'm like, all right, this is good,
[00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.240]   even though I was too chickened out.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.160]   And then just last week,
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.320]   one of those aunts actually invited my mom to lunch.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.880]   And I wanted to say it did not happen for the last 30 years
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.120]   'cause it's from my dad's side.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.400]   So we haven't seen them for some time.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.960]   And so my mom also told me, she's like,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.560]   okay, I will go and spread the gospel.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.520]   I'm like, all right, mom, you go, you go.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.360]   Because I kind of messed up last time.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.920]   So I said, I'll be praying for you.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.500]   And then, so she went,
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.020]   and of course she was also very scared.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.200]   And when you're scared, you sit through the entire dinner
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.380]   without mentioning what you wanted to say there, right?
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.320]   So eventually the people started getting up
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.640]   and they have to go, right?
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.600]   And that's when my mom mustered up the courage and said,
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.920]   you know, my daughter is speaking next week
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.680]   at the church on the Cantonese side
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.440]   'cause they only know Cantonese.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.900]   And I said, well, would you guys like to listen
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.080]   to the sermon?
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.540]   And surprisingly, a few of them said, yeah, okay.
[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.840]   But we thought to ourselves, well, just because they said,
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.040]   yes, we're not sure if they're gonna watch it.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.800]   But after my mom sent it out,
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.440]   actually one of the relatives watched it.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.960]   And then he encouraged everybody else to watch it,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.880]   which is a lot nicer than us promoting ourselves, right?
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.320]   So, and what I wanted to say was, you know,
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.920]   we might not be like Miriam,
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.600]   where's life and death all the time.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.440]   And thank God for that.
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.480]   But we're actually put in a position sometimes
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.000]   to be courageous for the ones we love.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.880]   And that might mean just mustering up that bit of courage
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.600]   to speak to, actually, I don't know why,
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.000]   but it's hardest to speak to our relatives
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.720]   and our moms and dads.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.880]   And, you know, maybe it's that,
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.280]   or to share it with our coworkers.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.440]   Or sometimes it might mean for us
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:59.440]   to see someone being in an unjust situation
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.680]   and just being courageous and putting out our hands
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.080]   to help them,
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.600]   even though there might be oppositions happening.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.720]   So today, you know,
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.840]   I really feel like God's asking us to be faithful servants.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.760]   And that means for us to be courageous,
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:19.000]   to help those around us, to bring them to Christ.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.200]   And a lot of time it just means doing that step.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.600]   So very proud of you, mom, you know?
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.600]   And yeah, so the next thing that, you know,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.240]   when Miriam appears again
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.640]   is actually at the crossing of the sea.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.640]   And that is in Exodus chapter 15, 19 to 21.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.160]   So this is a time when they have just crossed the Red Sea
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.120]   on dry land because God has split the sea
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.400]   and then they have crossed,
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.200]   but then the Egyptians that were chasing after them
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.640]   also went in and the water drowned them.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.720]   And this is the moment when Miriam comes up again.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.640]   And so let me read it to you.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:05.520]   In Exodus chapter 15, 19 to 21.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.440]   When Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.000]   went into the sea,
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.880]   the Lord brought the waters of the sea back over them.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.920]   But the Israelites walked through the sea on dry ground.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.120]   Then Miriam the prophet,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.960]   notice she's called the prophet here,
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.480]   Aaron's sister took a timbrel in her hand
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.480]   and all the women followed her with timbrels and dancing.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.840]   Miriam sang to them and Pastor John asked me not to sing.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.000]   So I will not sing this verse.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.760]   Sing to the Lord for he is highly exalted,
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.200]   both horse and driver he has hurled into the sea.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.080]   I still think it would have been better by saying it,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.400]   but anyways.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.920]   So the second point that we want to learn from Miriam
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.840]   about being faithful is to use our gifts.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.080]   Now Miriam led all the women in songs.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.840]   Now this is not just a few women, this is all.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.360]   Do you know how many women were there?
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.200]   600,000 women.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.040]   And they were praising the Lord together, singing this.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.720]   And not only was she a leader, but she was also a musician.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.640]   I mean, timbrels are probably a tambourine like instrument
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.640]   and imagine, I mean, just us having been here
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.200]   in front of maybe 100 people, it's hard enough,
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.560]   but 600,000 people.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.120]   And actually for her, as a female,
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.160]   she actually played a very unique role as well.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.840]   'Cause remember that time when the Pharaoh
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:45.520]   asked all the babies to be drowned?
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.200]   I mean, imagine the hurts in all of those mother's heart.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.160]   And also if your neighbors, if their baby was killed
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.800]   and you saw that, that must have been so painful
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:01.200]   for all of the women to be watching.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   And so this, for Miriam to step up with her leadership skill
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.320]   with her worship skills and just bringing the women together
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.480]   and allowing them this opportunity to say,
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.920]   look at our God, He has vindicated us.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.760]   Instead of having our babies drowned,
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.080]   now all of the Egyptians who came after us,
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.320]   they are drowning.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.480]   So she really stepped up and used her gifts.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.560]   And that's one of the ways that we can be faithful too.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   And I wanna read you from 1 Peter 4, chapter 4, 10 to 11.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:45.000]   It says, "Each of you should use whatever gift
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.880]   "you have received to serve others."
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   As faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.560]   If anyone speaks, they should do so
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.800]   as one who speaks the very words of God.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.780]   If anyone serves, they should do so
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.040]   with the strength God provides.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.540]   And you see here, Miriam was doing exactly that.
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.940]   She was a faithful steward.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.040]   She just stepped up and brought the ladies together
[00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.020]   to worship because that was her place
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.480]   and she seized the opportunity.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.800]   And I just wanna say that I'm very encouraged here
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.720]   at our church all the time.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.040]   I mean, last week, Christina came up
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.800]   and she was telling us about how she is starting
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.920]   to work with a lot of the babies
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.920]   and even the children's ministry.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.740]   And that's really her gift.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.640]   And we can see that it's her passion as well.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.620]   And of course today, and every week we saw our worship team.
[00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.480]   There's Paul and Yen and there's Kelly and Florence
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   and all of our musicians here.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.400]   They're using the gifts and talents really to help us
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.520]   to serve the Lord, to lead us into praise and worship.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.800]   And not to mention, at our sound booth,
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.020]   it's very dark at the back,
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.240]   but we have volunteers and interns
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.340]   and we've got Esther and Toby
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.160]   and then there's Fave and Sterling
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.160]   and they're faithfully serving with their gifts as well.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.340]   And our greeters, Kathy and Vincent helps out all the time
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.900]   along with the other greeters.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:22.340]   And it's just amazing to watch.
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.220]   And I can't even name all of us
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.340]   because there are so many of you guys doing that.
[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.420]   And we also have our clan leaders as well.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:33.840]   And I mean, the list can go on
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.540]   and then we'll stay here until 8 p.m.
[00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.100]   and then that will be an issue.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.260]   And so, I mean, I'm sorry if I left out your name.
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.180]   I didn't mean to.
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.040]   It's just the list does get really long.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.860]   But I just wanna say that it's so encouraging to watch
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:51.620]   because that's how we become the faithful stewards of God.
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.100]   And so today, I just wanna, once again,
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.940]   when we look at the story of Miriam
[00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.940]   and how she used her gifts.
[00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.480]   And why is it important?
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.200]   Because you are all very unique
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.560]   and you might be able to serve a group
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.700]   that someone else cannot.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.340]   So if you don't step up,
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.240]   someone is actually suffering from that.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.540]   So anyways, if you're one of those that says,
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.500]   "I have no gifts to share or use."
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:23.300]   You know what one of my gifts are?
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.700]   To identify other people's gifts.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.620]   So if you have trouble finding that,
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.420]   let's come to one of us
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.420]   and we'll be very happy to help you identify what those are.
[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.740]   So let us read on to see Miriam's life.
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.820]   So let's see.
[00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.420]   So she reappears again in the Bible in Numbers,
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.260]   the book of Numbers chapter 12.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.060]   Now this time, it isn't as bright as the first two times.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.660]   I will learn from her mistakes.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.780]   So this account is where the Israelites have,
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.860]   so they've just crossed the Red Sea
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.980]   and now they're approaching the Promised Land.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.100]   And this is what happens.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.420]   I will read it to you again.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:14.420]   It is Numbers chapter 12, starting in verse one.
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:19.500]   Miriam and Aaron began to talk against Moses
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.380]   because of his cushion wife,
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.460]   for he had Mary a cushion.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:29.780]   "Has the Lord spoken only through Moses?" they ask.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.460]   "Hasn't he also spoken through us?"
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.680]   And the Lord heard this.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.860]   Now Moses was a very humble man,
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.300]   more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.420]   Now the Lord was angry about this
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.380]   and actually asked all three of them
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.600]   to come out to the tent of meeting.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.900]   That's where they were.
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:54.900]   And he came down in a pillar of cloud, this is bad,
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.540]   and he stood at the entrance and summoned,
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.200]   Aaron, Miriam, come forward.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.780]   Okay, this is, you know, when the Lord calls you
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.780]   and it's not good, then, you know, we better be awake.
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.620]   So this is what he said in verse six.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.180]   "Listen to my words.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.600]   "When there is a prophet among you,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.460]   "I, the Lord, reveal myself to them in visions.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.660]   "I speak to them in dreams,
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.780]   "but this is not true of my servant Moses.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.920]   "He is faithful in all my house,
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.020]   "with him I speak face to face, clearly,
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.380]   "and not in riddles.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.180]   "He sees the form of the Lord.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.300]   "Why then were you not afraid
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.480]   "to speak against my servant Moses?
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.300]   "The anger of the Lord burned against them,
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.140]   "and he left them."
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:53.500]   Now Miriam's skin right afterwards was leprous.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.740]   It was white as snow,
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.900]   and it was as if it was half eaten away.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.900]   And Aaron was pardoned from this,
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:03.580]   most likely because Miriam was the one that initiated it.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.780]   And Aaron begged Moses,
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.860]   "Forgive us of our sins and pray to the Lord."
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:12.100]   And so Moses cried out to the Lord saying,
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.580]   "Please, God, heal her."
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.540]   And he did hear her prayer and healed her,
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.840]   except she was to be confined outside the camp
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.060]   for seven days before being back.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:28.540]   So, I mean, this is utter humiliation for Miriam,
[00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.940]   which is almost the exact opposite
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.980]   of what she was going for.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.300]   Because, I mean, what was it that she was trying to do?
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.300]   She was trying to accuse Moses
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:44.300]   of having this Kashite woman to be a wife.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.060]   And we're not quite sure what that means.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.180]   I mean, Kashite could mean the wife that she has,
[00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:54.380]   Sephora, when she was a Median wife,
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:58.900]   Median wife that he had acquired when he was in the desert,
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.380]   or it could mean that he had another wife,
[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.780]   but that her skin color was different.
[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:07.980]   And so, I mean, we don't really seem to know
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.000]   what the issue is,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.860]   but she seems to be using it against Moses to say that,
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.340]   "Well, he's not so great after all."
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.820]   And so, I mean, when we look at this,
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.980]   we see that God makes no comment
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.460]   on this cushioned wife of Moses.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.220]   So, obviously, it was not bothering God,
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.980]   but what was bothering God?
[00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.900]   What do you think it was that was Miriam's crime?
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.580]   I mean, could it be like last week
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.340]   when Pastor James is teaching us on envy?
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.620]   Was it because of envy and jealousy?
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.260]   I mean, it seemed to be like so on the surface, doesn't it?
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.260]   It seemed to be that he wants to be the same as Moses.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.900]   But if we look further into the scripture,
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.100]   what is really her crime?
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.300]   You see, her crime wasn't so much on what she said,
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.820]   because if it was envy and jealousy,
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.400]   then God will be a very busy person
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.300]   because he'll have to punish every person
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.900]   that's jealous or envious or even prideful.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.900]   But no, God came down actually for Moses, not for Miriam.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.660]   So what was her crime was that it wasn't so much
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.620]   what she did, but who she did it to.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:34.280]   It was because she was talking against his servant.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.340]   That was her crime.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.900]   And so now we can also learn from Miriam's mistake.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.780]   If we want to be faithful to God,
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.300]   actually, we need to focus on God.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:47.840]   This is the third point.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.320]   We need to focus on God.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.560]   You see, while Miriam was so focused on the power
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.240]   and the status, you know, rather or not,
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:01.080]   she is the same as a prophet as Moses,
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.660]   Moses was not focused on that.
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.460]   What was Moses focused on?
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.660]   God.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.020]   He was focused on just being faithful to God.
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.220]   And how do we know that is because in the previous chapter,
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:19.020]   in chapter 11, he was actually the one that asked God,
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.340]   "Could you send me some help?"
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:24.260]   Because all these Israelites, they're complaining
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.460]   that there's no meat in the middle of the desert.
[00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.300]   And then God said, "Okay, okay."
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.420]   Well, he didn't actually quote, I don't wanna say,
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.460]   I quote God saying, "Okay," right?
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.180]   So he actually said, "All right, bring 70 of the elders
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.960]   "and the officials, and I will take some of the power
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:45.160]   "that I've given to you, and I'm gonna place it on them
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.300]   "so they can help you."
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:52.240]   And so while he placed his hand on them and prayed for them,
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.060]   not only did the 70 people received God's power,
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.940]   but two more from outside that camp.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.100]   And so they were also prophesying.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:07.240]   And what happened was Joshua went straight to Moses saying,
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.260]   "They're prophesying, stop them."
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.900]   And you know what?
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.020]   This is what Moses replied.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.740]   "Are you jealous?"
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.820]   I didn't put it on my PowerPoint, I'll have to read it.
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.020]   "Are you jealous for my sake?
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:25.520]   "I wish that all the Lord's people were prophets
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.520]   "and that the Lord would put his spirit on them."
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.440]   So we can see that the heart of Moses
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.740]   was not on hoarding more power,
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.940]   but that he actually wanted all people to be prophets.
[00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.940]   And so we need to ask ourselves the same thing.
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:50.940]   Are we faithful to the job that God called us to do?
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.420]   Or are we faithful to God himself
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.060]   and how he wants to do things?
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:24:02.060]   Now, what we find is that Moses was so secure
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.180]   in his relationship with the Lord
[00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.780]   that he didn't feel like he had to compete
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.540]   or he has to get God's approval
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:13.720]   or to try to prove anything to anyone.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.060]   And I just wanna share with you
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:22.060]   how I also am so secure in my earthly father.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.380]   I mean, I remember a time when I was really young,
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:27.700]   I was about, I think eight or so.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:32.700]   And oh, well, I mean, for my entire youth time,
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.020]   my dad had favored me.
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:37.700]   And I have to say, this is not only my version,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.380]   you won't hear a different version from my sister, okay?
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.980]   And my dad favored me so much
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.380]   that when we went out for dinners,
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:51.060]   I was the one that got the shark fin soup with the rice.
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:52.660]   That is the (speaks in foreign language)
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:55.060]   Okay, if you know that dish.
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.140]   And I was the only one who got it.
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.240]   Everybody was sitting there.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.220]   So that was how much I was favored.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:04.260]   And I just, well, I knew that my relationship with him
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.300]   was rock solid.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.460]   And so one time, my sisters, I have two older sisters,
[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.860]   wronged me in some way and I was crying.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.540]   And I looked at myself in the mirror
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.860]   and I looked like I've just cried.
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.220]   And I know that if I walked out there,
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.460]   my dad would scold at them and would punish them.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.740]   And I really didn't want that to happen.
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.900]   So what I found in the bathroom was some baby powder.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.160]   And so I thought baby powder equals to makeup.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.300]   Hey, I was only eight,
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.180]   so I have no idea what the difference is.
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.660]   So there I was, powdering myself up
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.420]   and making sure that my dad would see me
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.620]   as if I haven't cried.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.700]   And of course, by the time I was done,
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.900]   my face was, I mean, white as a ghost.
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.260]   So, and so, you know, when I walked out,
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:54.140]   I mean, I thought it was perfectly looking,
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:57.580]   but of course my dad asked, have you been crying?
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.300]   And I'm like, yes.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.860]   Was your sisters mean to you?
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.420]   I was like, yes.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.580]   And then he asked, is it that you're putting on all this
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.500]   so I wouldn't punish them?
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.860]   And I said, yes.
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.580]   And then he said, well,
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.060]   because you don't want me to punish them,
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.100]   I will pardon them.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.860]   And, you know, I was so secure with my place
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.760]   in my father's heart that I didn't feel
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.700]   like I have to compete.
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.140]   And not only did I feel like I didn't have to compete,
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.220]   but I want, I didn't, I was,
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.460]   I was having enough love for even my sisters.
[00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.340]   And I feel like, you know, with this,
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.060]   when we see Miriam, what happened was
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.260]   she was still trying to gain the approval of men
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.020]   or trying to have a status in God's heart.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.380]   And that was not the right approach.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.380]   What was the right approach was what Moses had.
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:27:00.740]   And he had an extraordinary relationship with God.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.500]   It was so secure that he didn't have to fight over it
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.260]   or, you know, to feel like he's,
[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.320]   his status might be in jeopardy.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.420]   And that's why he could extend and say,
[00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:17.220]   I wish that everyone was prophets
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:20.940]   and was able to have the spirit on them.
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.060]   You know, that's something for us to think about.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:28.860]   I mean, are we also in the place where we're so secure
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.740]   that we don't have to compete for it?
[00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:34.000]   Or is it that sometimes that someone did something
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.260]   really well or even better than us,
[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.220]   that we start to feel like we need to prove
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.340]   that we're doing as good as them or even better
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.820]   or put them down.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.380]   And I mean, it's easy, you know,
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:50.760]   if that person is a lot older than you or a lot younger,
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.880]   but if you guys happen to come from the same background,
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.140]   let's say the same school around the same age,
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.940]   it just becomes so much harder.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.880]   But if we learn from this,
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.180]   which is if we have the right relationship with God,
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.860]   then we don't have to be like Miriam and be envious
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.380]   because we're so secure in God.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.960]   And so there are two things at least we can learn
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.700]   about God here is that when he has
[00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.020]   an extraordinary relationship with someone,
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:29.020]   he's actually ready to defend that person in a heartbeat.
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.120]   And also he's willing to reveal himself.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.440]   See here that he says, "For a prophet,
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.300]   "he speaks in like visions and riddles,
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.360]   "but not for Moses
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.040]   "because of this extraordinary relationship."
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   And also we see that he has extraordinary relationships
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:55.960]   with people who are humble and faithful to him.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.960]   And so that is the key, everyone.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.320]   That is the key.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.720]   How do we have this relationship?
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:08.720]   Is that we are humbled and we are also faithful to him.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:12.260]   Now, I mean, it's easy to say humble or faithful,
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.520]   but what does that mean?
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:16.480]   Well, if we look at John, not John,
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.200]   but if we look at the book of gospel of John,
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.880]   chapter 14, 21, it says,
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.480]   "Whoever has my commands and keeps them
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.720]   "is the one who loves me.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.600]   "And the one who loves me will be loved by my father,
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.040]   "and I too will love them."
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.200]   And see this, "And show myself to them."
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:45.240]   I mean, church, do you want God to show himself to you?
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.400]   Do you want him to love you?
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.400]   I mean, I don't wanna say this as if this is works.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:54.120]   We're not working to get a place in God's heart,
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:58.520]   but it says here that if we follow his commands,
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.400]   it means that we love him.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.840]   So this is an act of love that we're doing.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:06.220]   It is not the result.
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:11.040]   And so, I mean, just recently, I was reading my Bible
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.680]   and one of the scripture that I was reading
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.040]   was Hagar and Ishmael.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.080]   I mean, what I wanted to say is,
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.200]   every day when we read a Bible verse,
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.240]   it might not seem like it's very related
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.520]   to what we might be going through.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.160]   But if we take that verse, I mean, for me,
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.080]   it was Ishmael and Hagar,
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.760]   they were kicked out of Abraham's home.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.020]   And then they saw that there was no way out
[00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:38.080]   and they cried out to the Lord.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.340]   And then the Lord said, "I will bless Ishmael."
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:45.520]   And then her eyes was open and she saw an oasis
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.820]   where there was water and that's how they lived on.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.820]   And of course, he also became a prosperous nation.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.760]   So I mean, how would that help us
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.680]   if that happened to be the Bible verse that you read?
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:03.480]   And how it helped me was that I focus on God's goodness.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.240]   And so while I was preparing literally for this sermon,
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.680]   I prayed into those scriptures.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   And I just said, "God, you're the God that provides.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.960]   And right now I really need your divine enlightenment."
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   And he helped me.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.920]   He just gave me these enlightenments
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.280]   and I wrote this sermon with the fastest speed.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.600]   And I think Pastor John could be my testimony of that.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.360]   I can testify on it.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.680]   And so, I mean, what I wanted to say is that
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.020]   we need to not focus on the road that we're in,
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.040]   but we need to focus on building
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.380]   this extraordinary relationship
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:47.280]   so that God appears in our lives every single day.
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.920]   Now, so today concluding,
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.240]   I just wanted to say that in Miriam's life,
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.600]   she has both strengths and weaknesses
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:00.220]   and we can learn from it to see how we can be faithful
[00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.760]   in our walk with God.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.560]   I mean, she was courageous for her loved ones
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.640]   and we need to do that too.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.520]   She was using her gifts at the right time in a unique way
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.800]   that served the purpose of God.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.080]   And lastly, even though it was her mistake
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.120]   that she had focused on other things,
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:24.600]   but we know we can learn that we need to focus on God
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.160]   and building that intimate relationship with Him.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.640]   And that is the key.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.260]   'Cause while we serve God,
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.400]   it's easy to actually lose God Himself.
[00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   So today, let us all be faithful servants of God.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:46.440]   And the Lord our God shall speak to us then
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:52.080]   face to face and we won't have to guess what He is saying.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.280]   And He can show up in your life every single day.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:01.000]   So let us surrender everything that we have to Him
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.820]   and let us just want Him and Him alone.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:06.260]   So let us pray together.
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.640]   Dear Heavenly Father,
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:14.640]   we thank you so much that you are in our midst
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.600]   and Father, you said that if we keep your commands,
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:24.400]   we are the ones who love you and you will love us back
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.680]   and you will show yourself to us.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.240]   And Father, we pray that today,
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.260]   as we learn from the life of Miriam, your servant,
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.880]   that we too can know and remember
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.760]   that the most important thing of course
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.400]   is to use the gifts that you've given us,
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   but it's even more important that we focus on you.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:51.800]   And Father, we pray that we'll surrender ourselves
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.080]   for one purpose only,
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.220]   and that is to build this extraordinary relationship
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.140]   with you.
[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.800]   So help us God.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.560]   In Jesus Christ name we pray, amen.
