1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - Well, as you saw with the film,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,240
 today we are considering the parable of the prodigal son,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,420
 perhaps the most beloved of all the parables

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,740
 that Jesus told.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,060
 When I told a friend last week,

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,520
 I was preaching on the parable of the prodigal son.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,220
 He raised the question,

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,440
 who is the most stressed out in this parable?

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,040
 I thought the son, the father,

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,880
 or the older brother were in different ways,

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,640
 rather stressed, but I was wrong.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,840
 My friend said, the one who was most stressed out

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,360
 was the fatted calf.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,360
 (audience laughing)

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,360
 (audience laughing)

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,720
 This story called the gospel within the gospel

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,960
 and the world's greatest short story

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,120
 is the climax of three stories of lost things.

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,560
 A lost sheep, a lost coin,

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,780
 and lastly, a lost son.

21
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,480
 The sheep is lost,

22
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,400
 perhaps through careless wandering or inattention.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,760
 The coin is lost through no evident reason.

24
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,440
 But the heartbreak of this story is the son who is lost

25
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,700
 through deliberate rebellious choice.

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,700
 (audience laughing)

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,620
 Look at the heading in your Bible.

28
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,860
 It almost certainly highlights this lost prodigal son.

29
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,260
 It usually entitled the lost son or the prodigal son.

30
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,280
 But make no mistake.

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,100
 This story is primarily

32
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,580
 about a father.

33
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,700
 And it comes from the mouth of Jesus,

34
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,380
 a son who knew his father

35
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,060
 and he wanted lost people to know the father.

36
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,460
 And this parable dramatises

37
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,460
 four characteristics of the father.

38
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,300
 Let's read a few verses to kick off.

39
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,280
 Verse 11.

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,980
 And he said, there was a man who had two sons

41
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,340
 and the younger of them said to his father,

42
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:05,620
 "Father, give me the share of the property

43
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,940
 that's coming to me."

44
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:12,240
 And he divided his property between them.

45
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,260
 Not many days later,

46
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,660
 the younger son gathered all he had

47
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,700
 and took a journey into a far country.

48
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,700
 And there he squandered his property in reckless living.

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,340
 And we see the first characteristic of the father is this.

50
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,780
 The father gives us freedom to choose.

51
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,100
 The father allows the younger son to leave.

52
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,420
 Sometimes the worst thing that God can do

53
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,540
 is to give us what we want.

54
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:03,280
 To show us that our desires cannot bring satisfaction.

55
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:13,300
 The prodigal son got what he wanted.

56
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,220
 But lost what he had.

57
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,100
 Can I say that again?

58
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,340
 The prodigal son got what he wanted,

59
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,980
 but lost what he had.

60
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,100
 When we rebel against God's will,

61
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,660
 he sometimes says to us,

62
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,840
 "Okay, you win.

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,340
 Your will be done."

64
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,300
 Those of us who are parents,

65
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,220
 do you want your children to make good choices?

66
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,420
 Of course you do.

67
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:53,900
 Do you say no when they ask for something foolish

68
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,020
 or dangerous?

69
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,220
 Of course you do.

70
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,100
 An observation here,

71
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,260
 this is a lot easier when they're young.

72
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,820
 So much harder as children grow up.

73
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,180
 As a parent, I'd often wonder what God was thinking of

74
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,620
 when he dreamed up the blueprint for teenagers.

75
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,860
 But let's not go there.

76
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:23,100
 The first characteristic of this father

77
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,140
 is he allows his children freedom to choose.

78
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,500
 Whether the choices are wise or foolish,

79
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,140
 selfish or loving.

80
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,700
 Now the father's assets would not have been in cash.

81
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,020
 He wouldn't have been in the first century equivalent

82
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,580
 of HSBC.

83
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,820
 It would have been in land and livestock.

84
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,100
 Charles, illiquid you would say, right?

85
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,980
 Illiquid.

86
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:03,860
 Deuteronomy 21, 17 tells us by Mosaic law,

87
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,980
 a younger son's portion was one third.

88
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,900
 Thus his selfish demand would have required the father

89
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,660
 to liquidate a significant portion of all he owned.

90
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,820
 Notice the son's demand in verse 12.

91
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,780
 Give me a share of the property that is coming to me.

92
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,580
 Now, both the son and the father knew that his portion

93
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,940
 was to pass to him only when the father died.

94
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:48,420
 He was in reality and in Hebrew culture saying,

95
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:54,260
 father, I now choose to regard you as though you're dead.

96
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:04,860
 That is the seriousness of what we're talking about here.

97
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,860
 And yet, and yet the father freely gave of his possessions

98
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:18,820
 to the young son who had no assets of his own.

99
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:26,180
 Church, doesn't this remind you of the cries of our society?

100
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,780
 The voice of our age is the voice of entitlement.

101
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,580
 Oh, don't tell me what to do.

102
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,060
 I want to do what I wanna do.

103
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,140
 I deserve these things.

104
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,060
 I'm owed these things.

105
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,380
 I depend on myself.

106
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,460
 God, God tries to control me

107
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,600
 and just wants me to follow his rules.

108
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,780
 It sounds just like the younger son, doesn't it?

109
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,060
 But think for a moment of the heavenly father

110
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,140
 who is pictured in this earthly story.

111
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,220
 It is all his.

112
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,460
 He has made us.

113
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,020
 All we have comes from his gracious hand

114
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,780
 and his loving heart.

115
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:30,140
 And yet as we so often selfishly demand our own rights,

116
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,020
 our desires and our wants,

117
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,940
 our heavenly father gives us the freedom

118
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,140
 to do as we want and choose as we will.

119
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,980
 He allows us to spend our time, our assets,

120
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,740
 our skills and our gifts in the way that we choose.

121
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,220
 His love gives us freedom.

122
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,220
 Even if our freedom leads to loss and waste.

123
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:11,340
 But it is our choice.

124
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,940
 And it is the freedom a loving father gives

125
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,540
 for he will have no slaves or puppets,

126
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,100
 whatever the cost to him or us.

127
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,740
 The second characteristic of the father is this.

128
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:35,780
 The father suffers.

129
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:42,020
 Clearly in this story, the father grieves,

130
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,820
 grieves over his son's wrong decision.

131
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,660
 This is the second characteristic I want us to understand

132
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,860
 about the father.

133
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,220
 He is hurt by the son's choice.

134
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,540
 Imagine the loss of possessions, the loss of reputation

135
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,260
 and more than anything else,

136
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,500
 the loss of relationship with the son he loves.

137
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:14,300
 He feels the pain of rejection.

138
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:22,060
 I don't care about a relationship with you.

139
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,540
 I only care about what I can get from you.

140
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,460
 Shout the actions of the son.

141
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:33,460
 But remind yourself again.

142
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:41,060
 This story is first about the father.

143
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:49,380
 And can I say many of us have a wrong image

144
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,540
 of God the father.

145
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,460
 Perhaps dare I say, shaped by our own experience

146
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:02,220
 of our own human fathers.

147
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,620
 Have you not met those who even if they do believe

148
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,620
 in God at all, imagine him to be cold, uncaring, uninvolved.

149
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,940
 Is that how you see God the father?

150
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,300
 Be honest.

151
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,740
 I need to tell you, that is a lie.

152
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,700
 That is a lie told by an enemy

153
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,380
 that wants to keep us in a far country,

154
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:40,740
 wasting our lives and trying to provide meekly

155
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,980
 for ourselves.

156
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:49,140
 From Genesis to Revelation, we see a loving God.

157
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,300
 Grieving over the very ones who reject him.

158
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,260
 God grieves when his own rebellious people

159
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,980
 who had turned their backs on him, turn to other gods.

160
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,460
 Look at these passages, I've put them on the screen.

161
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,220
 Jesus in Matthew 23.

162
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,820
 Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets

163
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,780
 and stones those who are sent it.

164
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,300
 How often would I have gathered your children together

165
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,300
 as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings?

166
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,540
 And you would not.

167
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:36,140
 Or God the father in the Old Testament

168
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,100
 in the book of Hosea chapter 11.

169
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,700
 He says, "Oh, how can I give you up Israel?

170
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,100
 How can I let you go?

171
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,100
 My heart is torn within me and my compassion overflows."

172
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:57,380
 I'm sure that some of you here today are thinking,

173
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,300
 I know exactly how that father feels.

174
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,980
 I have a child, I have a loved one

175
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,460
 who has also gone to a far country.

176
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,140
 She is also distant from me.

177
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,020
 He's wasting the precious things he's been given.

178
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,780
 She's throwing away her life.

179
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,780
 He thinks he's really living, but he's really dying.

180
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:26,260
 You need to know that God the father agrees

181
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,980
 for those who are like the lost son

182
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,540
 also has a compassion for your pain too.

183
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,140
 More than you can know.

184
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,940
 Could you be a better parent?

185
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,700
 Yeah, of course.

186
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,140
 But even the perfect father himself

187
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,940
 had children who turned their backs on him

188
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,660
 and chose what they wanted over relationship

189
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,940
 with a loving father.

190
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,940
 But note in the parable,

191
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,860
 the father suffered, but the son also suffers.

192
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,700
 There are two sons in this parable.

193
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,820
 So consider with me for a moment, this younger son.

194
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,420
 So vividly portrayed are the consequences

195
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,940
 of the supposed freedom he enjoys.

196
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,860
 Let's read it.

197
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,580
 And when he spent everything,

198
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,180
 a severe famine arose in that country

199
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,140
 and he began to be in need.

200
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:30,820
 So he went and hired himself out

201
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,860
 to one of the citizens of that country

202
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,420
 who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.

203
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,340
 I'm just gonna pause there

204
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,780
 because how abhorrent would that be to a Jewish audience?

205
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,340
 A pig was unclean, right?

206
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,820
 And he was longing to be fed with the pods

207
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,820
 that the pigs ate and no one gave him anything.

208
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,340
 So the rebellious son suffers too.

209
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,940
 The first days of freedom, hey, they were heady

210
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,140
 and glorious, full of white women and song as we say.

211
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,100
 Only when he had wasted all

212
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,940
 do the consequences of his choice begin to bite.

213
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,580
 Only when he has spent everything,

214
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,940
 only when he spent everything he's been given

215
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,620
 is there a severe famine in that country.

216
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,220
 Only when he has wasted everything he has been given

217
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,060
 does he begin to be in need.

218
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,340
 He spent his father's resources without his father.

219
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,500
 Let me repeat that.

220
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:50,100
 He spent his father's resources without his father.

221
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,140
 And here's the truth we all need to know.

222
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,900
 Whenever we try to use the resources and provisions

223
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,020
 of the father, independent of the father,

224
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,660
 we will always run out.

225
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,180
 Oh, it may be fine for a time.

226
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,420
 Life is going well.

227
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,900
 Life is good.

228
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,020
 But sooner or later a famine will arise

229
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,300
 and we will begin to be in need.

230
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,740
 And like that young son in that far country,

231
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,340
 we try fruitlessly to provide for ourselves.

232
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,380
 But we'll still be hungry

233
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:37,780
 because it is only in the father's house

234
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,780
 in relationship with the father that we will be satisfied.

235
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,980
 I'm gonna say that again,

236
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,380
 'cause if you only remember one line

237
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,420
 from this sermon tonight, you need to remember this one.

238
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,980
 It is only in the father's house

239
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,260
 in relationship with the father that we will be satisfied.

240
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,780
 Third characteristic of the father

241
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,580
 is that the father waits.

242
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,980
 The father gives freedom to choose.

243
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,580
 The father hurts and grieves over his son.

244
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,940
 And here is some good news at last.

245
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,620
 The father is waiting.

246
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,740
 The father is waiting.

247
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,580
 He hasn't locked the gate.

248
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:26,780
 He hasn't disowned this young scoundrel of a son

249
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,100
 who has brought sorrow and disgrace to the family.

250
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,500
 The father is waiting for him.

251
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,340
 He's been standing on that porch every day

252
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,740
 since his son left just in case.

253
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,940
 How do we know that?

254
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,860
 Let's read it.

255
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,260
 But when he, the prodigal came to himself, he said,

256
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,980
 "How many of my father's hired servants

257
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,140
 have more than enough bread?

258
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,900
 But I perish here with hungry.

259
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,140
 I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him,

260
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:02,820
 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.

261
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,460
 I am no longer worthy to be called your son.

262
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,940
 Treat me as one of your hired servants.'

263
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,660
 And he arose and came to his father.

264
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,860
 But while he was a long way off,

265
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,860
 his father saw him and felt compassion.

266
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:27,140
 And he ran and embraced him.

267
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,180
 And kissed him.

268
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:36,500
 The father was not only waiting,

269
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:42,380
 but he must have been eagerly looking for that son of his

270
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,380
 because he saw him when he was a long way off.

271
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:51,620
 Think with me, how long does the father wait?

272
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,820
 It doesn't tell us by the way.

273
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,020
 Is it days?

274
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,500
 Is it months?

275
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,380
 Is it years?

276
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,700
 How long does the father wait?

277
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,740
 He waits as long as it takes.

278
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:16,140
 He waits as long as it takes.

279
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,700
 He doesn't give up on the young son.

280
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,820
 He doesn't write him off.

281
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,060
 He waits until the lost son comes to himself.

282
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,540
 When the son comes to himself, he sees clearly.

283
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,100
 He sees his father and himself.

284
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,140
 He now understands the blessing

285
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,500
 and generosity of his father's household.

286
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,100
 There's more than enough there for sons and servants.

287
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,900
 And painfully, but honestly, he realises he is unworthy.

288
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:01,540
 He is unworthy of grace, unworthy of forgiveness,

289
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,700
 unworthy of relationship.

290
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,860
 All that should speak to our hearts.

291
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,140
 We are as unworthy and dirty as that prodigal son.

292
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,620
 We stink of the pig pen.

293
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,540
 But Jesus took care of that with his life

294
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,660
 and death for us in our place.

295
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,660
 And that is why we are children of praise

296
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,140
 and gratitude and thanksgiving.

297
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,420
 Look at this.

298
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,060
 This is 1 John 3, 1.

299
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,180
 I could have picked many verses for this.

300
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,140
 Look at how great a love the father has given us

301
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,220
 that we should be called God's children.

302
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,380
 And we are.

303
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,580
 Romans 5, while we are utterly helpless,

304
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,660
 Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners.

305
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,900
 Now, most people would not be willing to die

306
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,980
 for an upright person,

307
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,180
 though someone might be perhaps willing to die

308
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,140
 for a person who's especially good.

309
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,300
 But God showed his great love for us

310
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,300
 by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.

311
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,380
 Wow.

312
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,660
 And what we see next is the lost son follows through.

313
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,980
 Now, before we look at the final characteristic

314
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,980
 of the father, consider something about this prodigal son

315
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,860
 who has shown himself quite worthless up to this point.

316
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:40,780
 When he comes home at his lowest point,

317
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,780
 hungry and dirty and homeless with the pigs,

318
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,660
 he realises he has believed lies

319
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,340
 about his life and his father.

320
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,300
 He says to himself something like this,

321
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,100
 I will get up and get out of this mess.

322
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,260
 I've got myself into this mess.

323
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,660
 I'm gonna go to my father

324
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,120
 and I will openly repent and humble myself.

325
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,460
 That's my understanding of the words at any rate.

326
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,340
 And that's exactly what he does.

327
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:21,380
 Church, it's not enough to have a moment of insight.

328
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,740
 It's not enough to realise how low you've sunk

329
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,540
 and how far you are from the father.

330
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,940
 It's not enough to realise you're miserable

331
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,660
 and hungry in the pig pen.

332
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:38,140
 It's not enough to spread a little cologne

333
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,260
 to cover the smell of the pig pen.

334
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:47,300
 Over the years, many I have talked to and prayed for

335
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,680
 who said they were going to do this,

336
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,220
 but have never followed through.

337
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:59,420
 If this is you today, it is time to follow through.

338
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:07,780
 It is time to get up and return to your waiting father

339
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,460
 and tell him I'm not worthy, but here I am,

340
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,300
 just as I am without one plea.

341
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:22,220
 And here's the best news of all.

342
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,320
 The father forgives.

343
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:31,160
 This is the last characteristic I want you to see today.

344
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,700
 Forthly, the father forgives.

345
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860
 And the son says to him,

346
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,860
 "Father, I've sinned against heaven and before you.

347
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,180
 I'm no longer worthy to be called your son."

348
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:48,260
 But the father said to his servants,

349
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,940
 "Bring quickly the best robe and put it on him.

350
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,780
 Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.

351
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,380
 Bring the fattened calf and kill it

352
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,900
 and let's us eat and celebrate.

353
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,340
 For this my son was dead and is alive again,

354
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,020
 was lost and is found."

355
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,120
 And they began to celebrate.

356
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,620
 Don't you just love that?

357
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,600
 The father doesn't ask for an inventory.

358
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,940
 He doesn't twist any screws by talking on how much

359
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,780
 he himself has lost or suffered.

360
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,540
 He doesn't even put the son on probation,

361
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
 which let's be honest,

362
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,220
 most of us think he deserves.

363
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:42,460
 He doesn't even take up the prodigal sincere offer

364
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,060
 of servitude in place of sonship.

365
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,180
 Instead, he immediately forgives.

366
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,060
 He immediately accepts.

367
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,340
 He immediately restores relationship.

368
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:58,340
 And that's why the robe, the ring and the shoes,

369
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,740
 that's what they signify.

370
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,080
 He immediately rejoices.

371
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,080
 What a picture of our loving heavenly father who forgives.

372
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,240
 He doesn't keep a record of our wrongs.

373
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,920
 No inventory, no grudge, no probationary period.

374
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:27,160
 That's your father in heaven.

375
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,520
 And aren't you glad?

662
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
 As we close,

663
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,840
 I want you to take a little time

664
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,620
 to think of this simple, vivid story

665
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,900
 of an earthly father with two sons,

666
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,400
 giving freedom to choose, suffering, waiting, forgiving,

667
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,960
 and then think of God, your heavenly father.

668
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,960
 Do you know him in this way?

669
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,800
 Do you see him in this way?

670
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,780
 He wants you to.

671
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:58,940
 Jesus, the son, said, "This is what the father is like."

672
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:06,480
 Can we have the banner, please?

673
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,480
 (sighing)

674
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:21,040
 This is a time for your own personal response

675
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
 to what we've just said.

676
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:28,520
 We're going to sing the song, Run to the Father.

677
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,200
 If anyone wants to get up and run to the front,

678
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,280
 you're perfectly able to.

679
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,700
 If you do, we'll pray for you.

680
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,560
 But I want you, I'm not going to prescribe this.

681
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,320
 I want you to respond to this in your own way.

682
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,320
 We'll run to the father differently.

683
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,860
 Some of you, while we're singing,

684
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,700
 you just might want to be quiet before him.

685
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,440
 Just spend that time with him.

686
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
 That's fine.

687
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,200
 Some of you, as we sing this song,

688
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,700
 may just want to picture,

689
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,600
 you know, we saw the reading on film.

690
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,100
 Maybe you just want to picture

691
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,620
 that son who was far away coming home.

692
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,280
 And the father who'd been waiting every day,

693
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,780
 running after his son.

694
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,560
 Welcome him back.

695
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,940
 I don't want anyone to leave here tonight

696
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,180
 without knowing the love of the father.

697
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,100
 (soft piano music)

698
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,400
 If you want somebody after the service

699
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,000
 to pray for you, to put their arms around you,

700
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,460
 to pray the love of the father,

701
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,300
 we're here to do that.

702
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:56,140
 But let's just stand for a moment.

703
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,340
 Father, when we were a long way off,

704
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,500
 you called us.

705
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:13,320
 And you brought us home for your son, Jesus Christ.

706
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,160
 Through the sacrificial death

707
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,240
 and the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

708
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,720
 we can call you father.

709
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,640
 (soft piano music)

710
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:40,140
 I just want you to imagine now,

711
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,560
 you've come back.

712
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:48,720
 The father's arms have gone around you.

713
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,200
 The father is saying,

714
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:08,400
 George, Julian,

715
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,360
 Kelly,

716
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:18,840
 all I want you to know right now

717
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,680
 is that you're my son.

718
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,980
 You're my daughter.

719
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,760
 I love you.

720
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,840
 And I'm so proud of you.

721
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,600
 You know that, your heavenly father's so proud of you,

722
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,920
 each one of you.

723
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:44,320
 And you say, but you don't know what I've done this week.

724
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,480
 This thing and that thing.

725
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,840
 And it's right to repent of sin, of course it is.

726
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,620
 God the father looks at you.

727
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,300
 All he sees is love.

728
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,040
 Allow him now,

729
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,060
 just to put his arms around you

730
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:11,360
 and receive that love.

731
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,120
 You are his beloved child.

732
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:22,400
 In you he is well pleased.

733
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,840
 (soft piano music)

734
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,520
 So let's sing run to the father.

735
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,100
 (gentle music)
