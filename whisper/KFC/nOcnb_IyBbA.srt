1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,120
 Just reminded even just now, just of the power of being as a family, just being together,

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,240
 even these last few weeks and last few months have not been easy.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,080
 But I'm just so proud of the family we have at KFCI and even these last few weeks we've

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,000
 had the trivia night, we've had a farewell night for Josh and Mel, we got to witness

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,720
 Paul and Mel's, different Mel by the way, wedding and all of it on Zoom.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,280
 It's not easy and I'm just so glad that we still get to see each other's faces, so glad

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,080
 to see everyone is still alive and well.

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:45,920
 And the Apostle Paul says, "How I yearn to be with you all, how I yearn for you all with

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,440
 the affection of Christ Jesus."

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,760
 I'm feeling that right now as we're heading into April, we're in April now and we've been

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
 at this for so long.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,600
 So I just wanted to just applaud all of you.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,680
 During our pre-service prayer, Mel mentioned that it doesn't come easy.

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,880
 This Zoom thing doesn't come easy.

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,080
 And another sister said, "Worship is still the top priority."

16
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,560
 So let's sit down and let's just really let the Word of God, let the Spirit of God really

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,760
 minister to us even over Zoom, even when it's hard.

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,960
 So I wanted to encourage you, you may find it hard, it's not as engaging as in real life,

19
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,040
 but I'm just really glad that we're making the effort.

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,600
 I wanted to ask one more thing of you today as I was preparing this message, I felt quite

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,080
 convicted not to do any slides.

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,360
 Again, I'm not entirely sure why, but I just felt as though actually this, as I open up

23
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,120
 this Word, my prayer is that one, you'll be able to as well.

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,240
 So maybe at this moment, if you are used to using a paper Bible, I encourage you to go

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,480
 and grab it.

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,760
 If you need a notepad to take notes or whatever it may be, or if you just phone, turn on airplane

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,920
 mode, focus mode, whatever it might be, I just pray that as I share from the Word of

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,760
 God, that this will then seep into your hearts and really open your eyes.

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,920
 Open your eyes to something new that God is wanting to reveal to you today.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
 Is that okay?

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,840
 So do pay attention, hold on tight.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
 It's a very simple message.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,080
 You'll be encouraged to know that.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,400
 There's only three points.

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,920
 And as Bonnie read so well for us, it's from John chapter 14, and there's this famous,

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,840
 famous declaration that he makes, "I am the way and the truth and the life."

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,120
 Can I just quickly pray before we continue from here?

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
 Join me.

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,680
 Jesus, we are just so grateful.

40
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
 We are just so grateful that we get to meet like this.

41
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,240
 And your Word says, "Don't neglect to meet each other.

42
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,640
 Stow each other up in love and good works, encouraging each other as the day draws near."

43
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,560
 And so here we are on Zoom.

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,120
 It's not quite the upper room, but we are just thankful for this.

45
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,600
 And right now we calm our hearts and we turn our eyes to you, the author and perfecter

46
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,040
 of our faith.

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,360
 We ask you to just show us more.

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,160
 What did you mean when you say you were the way, the truth, and the life?

49
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,920
 And how can we take that truth into our minds and have it drop into our hearts and then

50
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,640
 into our hands so we can live it out in this day and age?

51
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,840
 So be with us now.

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
 In your name we pray.

53
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
 Amen.

54
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:23,160
 So, one of the most famous and audacious claims that he makes, 14 verse 6, Jesus said, "I

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,720
 am the way, the truth, and the life."

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,920
 And the focus isn't even just on those three words, way, truth, and life.

57
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,840
 It's that he is the way, he is the truth, and he is the life.

58
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,600
 He is the only way, only truth, and only life.

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,960
 So this is a famous declaration of himself, but this is probably one of the most audacious

60
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,560
 ones, where he's coming out and saying, "Hey, I am the only way."

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
 Some people who say, "Why is Christianity so snobbish?

62
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,480
 Why is it so arrogant, claiming that this is the only way?

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,440
 Don't we all, don't all roads lead to heaven?"

64
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,160
 And what we see here is, and yes, in some ways we can say Christianity, what Jesus is

65
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,840
 declaring here is exclusive.

66
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
 He is saying he's the only way.

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,760
 That is probably, some have described it as an inclusive exclusivity, that whilst it is

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,520
 the only way, all are welcome.

69
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,920
 And Jesus had this way of speaking in such a way.

70
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,320
 This is why his disciples found it so hard to understand him.

71
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,520
 And even in this context, they struggled a little bit.

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,200
 And it's a really funny question that we see Thomas ask that triggers off this declaration.

73
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,120
 He's got all the humility, but zero modesty.

74
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,440
 And that's Jesus.

75
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,920
 And in these, "I am" declarations, there is no hint of modesty.

76
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,960
 He is being truthful about who he is, yet still being completely humble.

77
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,760
 What kind of Lord do we serve that is like that?

78
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
 Isn't it incredible?

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,840
 And so we have here, see, I wanted to show you a little bit of the context.

80
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,280
 So in John 14, let's rewind a little bit to John 13.

81
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
 This is the last supper.

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,520
 Now, of course, Jesus knew this was the last supper, but his disciples did not.

83
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,280
 This was just another supper for them.

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,440
 And so they're hanging out and they're eating, and then suddenly Jesus throws them a curveball

85
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,840
 and he gets off his seat, takes off his robe, and then wraps it around his waist and then

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,200
 starts to wash their feet.

87
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
 Peter is outraged.

88
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,360
 "No, you can't do this, Lord.

89
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,960
 What are you doing?

90
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,080
 You created heavens and the earth.

91
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,960
 You will not be washing my feet."

92
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,200
 So there's that whole little scene there.

93
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:32,040
 And then Jesus, suddenly after teaching them that in chapter 13, verse 21, suddenly it

94
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,240
 says he was troubled in his spirit.

95
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,640
 And so then he starts to reveal that actually now is time for something else.

96
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,920
 Not only am I going to wash your feet, something else is going to happen in the next few hours.

97
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,600
 Someone is going to betray me.

98
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,920
 And that's the second part of chapter 13.

99
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,680
 And then once Judas leaves, and then Jesus says, "Look, I've got one more thing to say

100
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
 to you guys.

101
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,800
 I've got one more speech.

102
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,280
 Hang with me.

103
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,480
 Listen to me as I share this with you, share my heart with you.

104
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
 Love one another."

105
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,240
 Verse 34, "Love one another."

106
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,080
 And that is how the world will know that you're my disciples.

107
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,400
 And then Peter goes, "Wait, wait, wait, you're saying, tell us to love each other because

108
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,280
 you're going somewhere that we can't go.

109
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,280
 Where is this?

110
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,520
 We want to go with you."

111
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,040
 And then this is where it kicks off in chapter 14.

112
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,560
 And he says, "Let not your hearts be troubled."

113
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,760
 14, verse 1, "Let not your hearts be troubled.

114
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,960
 Believe in God.

115
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,700
 Believe also in me.

116
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,400
 In my Father's house are many rooms.

117
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,840
 If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?

118
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,320
 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself.

119
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,700
 That's where I am.

120
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,520
 You may be also.

121
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,120
 And you know the way to where I am going."

122
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,160
 Just pause there for a second.

123
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,080
 Imagine you're a disciple.

124
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,360
 You didn't know this is the Last Supper.

125
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,360
 You did not know the significance of this day.

126
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,840
 Jesus washes your feet, freaks you out.

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,760
 Then he says someone's going to betray him.

128
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,000
 One of you are going to betray him.

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,440
 Then he says, "Just love one another."

130
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,640
 He's getting all dramatic about everything.

131
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,400
 Actually, once you understand all of that, you will then appreciate what Thomas says

132
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
 in light of that in chapter 14.

133
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,720
 And he says this, verse 5, "Thomas said to him, 'Lord, we do not know where you are going.

134
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,680
 How can we know the way?'"

135
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,000
 He says, "We do not know."

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 Can you imagine?

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,560
 You know, Thomas gets a really bad rep.

138
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,040
 When we say the word Thomas from the Bible, what do we think?

139
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,480
 What's the second word we think?

140
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:37,920
 Can you imagine making two simple mistakes in the Bible and forever for the rest of history,

141
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,560
 you are labeled by the mistake that you made, that you are now doubting Thomas for now and

142
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
 forevermore?

143
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,160
 But actually, he asks a very sensible question.

144
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,200
 Jesus is throwing curveball after curveball here.

145
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,600
 And you can just imagine the disciples looking at each other and going, "What is this guy

146
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
 talking about?

147
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,440
 I know he's confusing, but tonight he's had too much to drink.

148
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
 He's gone over."

149
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,640
 And so you can imagine him just putting his hand up and saying, "Lord, we actually don't

150
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,160
 know what you're talking about.

151
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,400
 Where are you going?

152
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
 We don't know the way.

153
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,560
 We don't have a clue what you're talking about.

154
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
 Explain to us."

155
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,160
 And then in verse 6, he says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."

156
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,600
 But you see, the thing is, Thomas's question there, how do we know the way?

157
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
 How can we know the way?

158
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
 What is this way?

159
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,340
 Isn't that a question that we're all actually asking?

160
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,140
 We know that Jesus here is talking about eternity.

161
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,820
 He's talking about his father's house that has many rooms.

162
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,080
 He's talking about eternal life.

163
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,440
 Isn't that the question that we're actually all asking?

164
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,600
 What Thomas just asked, how can we know the way?

165
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:50,360
 Essentially, he's saying, how can we get eternal life?

166
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,420
 What are the directions to heaven?

167
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,000
 If we just pause there for a second, isn't that what our hearts yearn for over and over

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 again?

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,880
 That we're searching for something that is in another world.

170
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:08,640
 2 Corinthians 5 talks about this earthly tent and this groaning that we have being here

171
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,400
 because things are just not right.

172
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,320
 And we just know in our hearts that we are not home.

173
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,920
 And maybe these few months in Hong Kong has brought that all to the surface for us.

174
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,240
 And recently, we just heard all the people who are struggling with suicidal thoughts,

175
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,880
 trying to take their own lives.

176
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,880
 All of this is a search for this home that we're looking for.

177
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,180
 Every one of us is asking that same question.

178
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,920
 How can we know the way?

179
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:45,640
 Ecclesiastes says this in chapter 3, that the Lord planted eternity into our hearts

180
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,640
 like a compass.

181
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:52,760
 Our hearts are pointing there, but being in this earth simply doesn't satisfy us completely.

182
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,920
 C.S. Lewis was the one that said, "If I find in myself desires which nothing in this world

183
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,440
 can satisfy, the only logical explanation is that I was made for another world."

184
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,120
 If I find in myself desires which nothing in this world can satisfy, the only logical

185
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,200
 explanation is that I was made for another world.

186
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,160
 And so Jesus answers that state of the heart.

187
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,360
 He answers that question.

188
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,680
 And he answers that question for us, for you, for me.

189
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,080
 When we're asking, why are we not home yet?

190
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,920
 Why does this not feel right yet?

191
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,800
 How do we get there?

192
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,200
 This way that you're talking about, Jesus, how do we get there?

193
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,560
 And he says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."

194
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,840
 He gives an emphatic answer saying that he is the way.

195
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,360
 And we find out that the way isn't a direction.

196
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
 It's not northeast.

197
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,920
 It's not a geographical term, but it's a description of the revelatory work of Jesus.

198
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,440
 When Jesus says, "You will know the way," what he's actually saying is, "You will know

199
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,920
 me.

200
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,320
 You will know me."

201
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,880
 That quest for knowing the way is actually knowing Jesus himself.

202
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
 They're synonymous.

203
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,320
 They're the same thing.

204
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:12,840
 Knowing Jesus equals knowing God, equals eternal life, equals to ending up at home.

205
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,200
 That quest for home means that we can't be satisfied by anything here on earth.

206
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,000
 John 17, later, after he finishes this spiel, and it's a long speech, and it won't be as

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,560
 long as, well, it's much longer than what we're going to be doing tonight, from 14 to

208
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,480
 16, he's just sharing everything, the final words.

209
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,040
 And then in 17, John 17, he prays, right?

210
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,440
 This is Jesus' prayer.

211
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,320
 And he says this, 17 verse 3, and he says this, "And this is eternal life, that they

212
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,840
 know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."

213
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,600
 Hidden here in scripture, in plain sight, he describes what eternal life is in his prayer.

214
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,280
 And this is eternal life, that you would know you, the only true God.

215
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,360
 So how do you know the way?

216
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,000
 You need to know the person.

217
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,760
 So the question really I have for all of us tonight is, how well do you know Jesus?

218
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,160
 I'm not going to do a quiz.

219
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,800
 I'm not going to do a Bible quiz to see how much of scripture you know about who he is.

220
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,840
 But my question is, do you know him personally?

221
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,080
 Those of you who know us, you know that I'm a big fan of basketball, just like Pastor

222
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,200
 Johnny is.

223
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,160
 We both love playing basketball.

224
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,240
 I beat him regularly.

225
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,080
 He's been saved by the restrictions currently.

226
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,600
 And I grew up being a fan of Michael Jordan.

227
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,680
 And I can tell you, I know Michael Jordan.

228
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
 I know when his birth date is.

229
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,000
 I know how many seasons he played in the NBA.

230
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,440
 I know each and every shoe that Nike released on behalf of him, and all the different colorways

231
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,440
 when they were released, how many points he scored that season, how many titles he won,

232
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
 how many scoring titles.

233
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
 I know everything about Michael Jordan.

234
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,920
 Well, I don't know everything, everything, but you get the point.

235
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,040
 But I don't know him personally.

236
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,680
 So I can tell you everything about him.

237
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,240
 But I confess, I don't actually know him.

238
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,000
 This is a confession that I'm making online.

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,880
 I've had dreams about Michael Jordan and meeting him.

240
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,200
 But I have never met him in person.

241
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,400
 I don't know him.

242
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,520
 The question here is, you may know Jesus.

243
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,360
 You may have grown up in Sunday school.

244
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,120
 You may have heard the stories.

245
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,600
 He turned water into wine.

246
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,400
 He was born in a manger in Bethlehem.

247
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,440
 My question to you is, do you know him personally?

248
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:43,440
 Because he says, when you know me personally, you will have eternal life.

249
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,560
 So I don't know whether you can answer that question.

250
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,640
 Do you know Jesus personally?

251
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,320
 And what I want today in my sharing is just to help you,

252
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,600
 help you get to a point, even understanding these three words.

253
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,120
 He's the way, the truth, and the life.

254
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,160
 If we can get our heads around, get our hearts around what those three words mean,

255
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,960
 maybe it starts us on a journey in knowing Jesus personally.

256
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,760
 Are you with me?

257
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,920
 Is that good?

258
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,720
 So that's my prayer today, that we would understand these three words.

259
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,920
 So let's start with the first one.

260
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,640
 Jesus says, I am the way.

261
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,400
 It's the central term, as it was the subject of the question.

262
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,120
 Thomas is asking, how do we know the way?

263
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,960
 So Jesus says, I am the way, the only way.

264
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,960
 Matthew 7 says this, the road to heaven is a narrow road.

265
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,520
 It's a small gate.

266
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,800
 Yet, of course, it's an inclusive kind of exclusivity.

267
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,160
 So even though it is a narrow road, even though you have to go through a small gate,

268
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,480
 once you get there, he says, my father's house has many, many rooms.

269
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,800
 It may be the only way, but everyone is invited.

270
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,200
 In Revelation, at the end, chapter 7, it says, there's a great multitude that no one can number

271
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,920
 who will be in his presence.

272
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,880
 And we know now that it's not a direction.

273
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,160
 It's not a route.

274
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,880
 When he says, I am the way, it's not a route.

275
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,120
 What is it then?

276
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,520
 It's an expression of one's unity with God.

277
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,120
 It's knowing him personally.

278
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,400
 Now, here's where I think we fall short.

279
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,520
 This is where I definitely fall short.

280
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,680
 When I hear Jesus is the way, often in my life, I have treated him as Google Maps.

281
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,400
 I have treated him as a signpost.

282
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,400
 I treat him as telling me, Jesus, show me the way.

283
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,320
 How do I do that?

284
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,080
 Jesus, show me what courses to study at university.

285
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,520
 Jesus, show me which person should be, will be my wife.

286
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,400
 Show me which job to take.

287
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,680
 Show me which country to move to.

288
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,920
 Show me what to do here.

289
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,280
 Show me where to go here.

290
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,360
 Show me all these things.

291
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,800
 I treat Jesus as basically a signpost.

292
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,520
 I'm asking him to point me in the direction.

293
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:54,560
 And now, if someone came and analyzed your prayers, who would they think Jesus is?

294
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,240
 See, that's a good way to kind of self-reflect who we think Jesus is.

295
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,720
 If someone came and listened to your prayers and listened to how you speak to Jesus,

296
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,560
 what would they get out of it?

297
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,280
 Often, our prayers are, Jesus, can you show us what to do here?

298
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,000
 Can you show us where to go here?

299
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,160
 Can you do this for us?

300
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,960
 Can you do that for us?

301
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,760
 If someone analyzed our prayers, often it would be, they'd get the impression that,

302
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,760
 wow, Jesus is this very powerful security guard.

303
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,960
 He's like, he's got your back.

304
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,440
 Wherever you go, you just tell him to go with you and he'll protect you.

305
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,360
 He's like a bouncer.

306
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,040
 Or he's a doctor.

307
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,480
 Oh, he'll heal this, he'll heal that.

308
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,880
 Or maybe he's just a satellite navigation system.

309
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,280
 He'll tell you where to go.

310
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,040
 Now, of course, he does do those things.

311
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,360
 He does.

312
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,920
 But it isn't just to point us to a job or to a relationship or to a place to live or to what to do or where to go.

313
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,880
 We've seen the Holy Spirit guide.

314
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,120
 In Acts 16, we see him guiding Paul.

315
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,840
 But then he's not just a signpost, is he?

316
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,320
 He's not a signpost to the end.

317
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,680
 He is the end.

318
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,240
 And I often find this to be true, is Jesus often doesn't really mind,

319
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,160
 or maybe he doesn't even care about some of the small decisions that I make.

320
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,320
 When I say, oh, Jesus, should I go here or should I go here?

321
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:18,400
 Should I go to Greece for holiday or shall I go to Malta?

322
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:25,240
 Often, now, disclaimer here, Jesus really does care about all the small things in our lives.

323
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,760
 The question for us is, do we place those small things above him?

324
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,400
 You see, the way we should ask isn't, Jesus, what do you want me to do?

325
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,000
 It's actually, which of these ways will get me closer to you?

326
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,520
 Which of these ways will help me know you more?

327
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:54,960
 Recently, I was talking to a businessman who was considering a role in a big bank, and another fellow pastor of mine, he was like, you know what?

328
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:04,920
 Whether you choose this job or not, to God, sometimes I think it's like the difference between choosing a tasty fan or one that mean for lunch.

329
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:13,520
 Like, actually, even though you think this big job is a huge thing, but to God's almighty.

330
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:22,680
 The size of it is basically the same as it could potentially be the same as just what lunch you choose to eat, because God just wants you and he will use you in whatever way you want.

331
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:29,600
 But I think sometimes we consume ourselves with ourselves, and we ask God to fit in to those just plans.

332
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,480
 We ask God to point us. We treat him as a signpost when he's not.

333
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,720
 He is the way. He is the end.

334
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,920
 He is everything.

335
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:45,320
 Psalm 27, one of my favorites is, if there's one thing we should pray for, if there's one thing that I ask, David says, is that I would dwell in the house of God all the days of my life.

336
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,360
 That's it.

337
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,000
 Jesus tells us himself, Matthew 6, 33, he says, seek me first.

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,800
 Seek me first and everything else will be fine.

339
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,960
 So the goal above all goals is to know God.

340
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,880
 Every decision that we make should be with that goal in mind.

341
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,960
 So would we, brothers and sisters, not allow, not just have God be part of our decision making process.

342
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,080
 Can we make him the goal of all our decisions?

343
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,160
 Now that we must pursue him first because he is the goal.

344
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,960
 We have to understand this.

345
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,880
 We have to understand this.

346
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,360
 So I'll just pause there for a second.

347
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,560
 What decisions are you asking Jesus right now?

348
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,280
 We should all be asking Jesus something, and I get that.

349
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,000
 And it's a good thing to do.

350
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,640
 But my question to you is, as you're asking him for directions, what's your main purpose at the end?

351
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,600
 What's your main objective?

352
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,360
 Is this just so that you can get to know the right route so it's the smoother one that will allow you to be more prosperous?

353
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,200
 That it will be an easier one to get you more success?

354
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,760
 Or is it, I'm asking you for directions, Lord, because I want you to be there at the end.

355
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,200
 Now, it's nuanced.

356
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,400
 It's such a it's just a slight difference in the posture of the heart.

357
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,360
 And I encourage you right now, as you're asking Jesus, which way should I go?

358
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,680
 How should I know the way? Make knowing him the end.

359
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,400
 Make knowing him the final objective.

360
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,080
 That is the goal. Because why? Because he is the way.

361
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,360
 So this statement here, I am the way, the truth and the life, likely means this.

362
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,440
 I am the way to the father in that I am the truth and the life.

363
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,080
 The next two actually are used to basically explain and qualify that first one.

364
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,560
 I am the way to the father in that I am the truth and the life.

365
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,440
 So the way is a who? The way is a who? It's Jesus.

366
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,360
 So the second one, then the truth, if the way is a who, the truth, I guess, is a what?

367
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,080
 It's referring to what's actually real.

368
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,320
 What's truth? Another version of Bible would say he is the way and the reality and the life.

369
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,720
 The word truth that is replaced with reality.

370
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,360
 And he's saying that I am the only thing that's real.

371
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:11,120
 You see, when you understand that Jesus is the way, then you recognize Jesus as the truth, that he was the word made flesh.

372
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,280
 In the beginning of John, it says in the beginning was the beginning is the word and the word became flesh.

373
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,480
 Right. So he's saying and why is it the flesh?

374
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,560
 Because he's making the truth of God available to all.

375
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:33,000
 It's very hard if you can imagine just for a second to try to imagine from God's perspective, which is far, far above us.

376
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,040
 He's trying to help us understand him.

377
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:46,120
 But it's impossible. Every day I'm trying to make our toy poodle Walter understand what I'm saying to him.

378
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:53,120
 To tell him that he needs to go to the toilet on this tiny little piece of green patch here and nowhere else.

379
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,160
 And he doesn't seem to get it.

380
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:03,080
 I try to explain to him that I can't stay in the house all day because I have to work, because I have to earn money so I can buy food for him to eat.

381
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:13,080
 He doesn't get it. He doesn't understand who I am or what I do, other than the one that should just be here and feed you him.

382
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,320
 So therefore, is how much more difference is that between us and God?

383
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,120
 We on our own will really struggle to understand who God is.

384
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,320
 So what did God do in his grace?

385
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,960
 He gave us Jesus. See Jesus as a visual aid for learning who God is.

386
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,040
 God said, you have no chance at understanding me, but I'll tell you what I'll do.

387
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,760
 I'll become one of you. I'll become one of you.

388
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:45,320
 And therefore, and it will be a visual aid and through Jesus, I will reveal myself to you.

389
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,320
 So he's revealing the truth of God in himself.

390
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,760
 So knowing Jesus is a relationship with him.

391
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,800
 And now, once you have that, you'll be liberated with this truth of God.

392
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,400
 You finally know what's real.

393
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,680
 Do we get that? So in Jesus, why is he the truth?

394
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,160
 He is the truth because through him you meet the truth of God.

395
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,520
 You finally get to see who God is.

396
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:17,320
 And you can finally get to know his heart and you finally get to see what he has to say about life.

397
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,600
 Don't we all want that? When you're struggling to understand what this invention is, what do you do?

398
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,440
 You go to the inventor, you go to the creator to explain it to you.

399
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,840
 So for us, it's the same. If we want to know the truth about God, then we go through Jesus because he is the visual aid.

400
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,040
 He is the one that was the word that became flesh, the truth that became flesh.

401
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,760
 And God's word is absolute, final and reality.

402
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,440
 It is the ultimate reality. Above what?

403
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,240
 Above any opinions and feelings and trends and hashtags that are happening right now.

404
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,160
 I don't know about you, sometimes I don't know what's real anymore.

405
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:58,880
 And there's this new thing, the metaverse, that we're all going to be exploring at some point.

406
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,520
 And I'm sure that we'll all end up there in some shape or form.

407
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:10,280
 And I'll create my own little character that will have hair and I'll be able to live out my dreams that way.

408
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:20,600
 But the truth is. We need to hold on to truth when we head into this day and age where we simply just don't know what's going on,

409
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:30,640
 we don't know what truth, like we can open any news outlet, whether it's SCMP or BBC or CNN or some of you may like Fox News,

410
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,680
 but whatever it may be. We can't know whether those things are true or not, right?

411
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,040
 Like who knows whether they're true or not? When we see a picture, we don't really know what's happening.

412
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,440
 Do we even know what's real anymore? We see what Jesus is saying here.

413
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,920
 It doesn't matter because I am the only truth. What you think is true isn't even true.

414
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:58,920
 I am the only one who is true. You are to hold on to me and what I say about this life, because that is the only reality.

415
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:08,120
 That is the only thing that is real. That is the only thing that will last and be able to pass through the test of time.

416
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,440
 Actually, I recently was convicted by this. I don't know about you.

417
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,520
 Every morning I wake up, I load up my phone and I have a look at SCMP.

418
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,720
 I see how many cases there are. I see what's happening in Europe. I see what's happening in America.

419
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,760
 You know, one day I felt the Lord really reminded me and convict me.

420
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,440
 And it was like, James, you wake up, you open your eyes and the first thing you do is look at those things.

421
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,400
 How confident are you that those things are the truth?

422
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,320
 Why aren't you spending your first, you know, Bible talks about first fruits.

423
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,760
 Why aren't you spending your first minutes of attention on this? The real truth.

424
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,920
 Why do you let those things in first? Do you abide in my word first?

425
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,360
 Or are you simply holding on to everything that everyone else says about this world?

426
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,440
 Because I am the truth. I am the only truth. So my encouragement to us is if this is the only thing that's real,

427
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:09,200
 do we treat it that way or do we treat it as an optional extra? Do we treat him as an optional extra?

428
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:15,560
 Do we treat the Bible as real as we do with the SCMP or the National Geographic?

429
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,840
 My prayer is that we would let the truth and reality of Jesus revealed to us in this word,

430
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:27,320
 in the person of Jesus, and allow that truth to permeate into our souls and impact the way we live.

431
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:34,320
 I said I shared last time in my message, I'm convinced that as those of us who are following Jesus, we must look different.

432
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,120
 We must act different. We must speak different. We must think different to those around us.

433
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,600
 How do we do that? Hold on to truth. How well do you know truth?

434
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:54,640
 As a pastor, I can confess to you, it's only been these last few years with everything that's happening that I've really started to learn what it means to cling on to truth.

435
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:02,040
 I've been sharing with some people as well. I started for the very first time to memorize long passages of scripture.

436
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,720
 And this last two months, I got through the whole of Philippians.

437
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,800
 So it's all in my head. The whole book of Philippians is in my head.

438
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,160
 And I try and recite it regularly. And I'll tell you what it did to me.

439
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:17,680
 It blew my mind in terms of how I was perceiving the world.

440
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:25,400
 I realized that I was treating the Bible as just helpful bite sized aids for whenever I needed it.

441
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:33,680
 But if I overlooked over this whole thing, like allowed this truth to seep into my soul, suddenly I felt this peace and this faith.

442
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,640
 It's like, man, this world is so much bigger than even what's happening in these few months.

443
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,080
 We are called to so much bigger than just trying to sort ourselves out.

444
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,040
 Allow the truth of Jesus to permeate into your life.

445
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:54,080
 Ask yourself, how well do you know his truth? How seriously do you take it?

446
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:59,320
 So the way is a who? The truth is a what? It's what's real.

447
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,080
 What is truly real? And we know this is what's real.

448
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,960
 And finally, the life. I guess you could say the life is a how.

449
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,320
 How we even are able to live. The same that Jesus says is he's like, I am the way, the truth and the life.

450
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,240
 Later in John 11, he says, I am the resurrection and the life.

451
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,200
 John 1 says in him was life and the light of men.

452
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:32,280
 See, Paul talks about him saying in Acts 17, he says in him, we live and move and have our being.

453
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:38,800
 He's saying, I am the life that I am the life of God himself.

454
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,200
 I am the access point to God's promise of life.

455
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,520
 I promised you that in me, through me, you would have life and life to the full.

456
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,400
 I am the access point to God's promise of life.

457
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,920
 So this statement, I am the way, the truth and the life could be read.

458
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:02,240
 I am the real and living way. I am the only real and living way.

459
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,960
 Do we recognize that? That actually what we have right now is because of Jesus,

460
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,160
 because of Jesus living through us, allowing us to have breath.

461
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,240
 Sometimes we think, oh, you know what, I've got to give so much of my life to Jesus.

462
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,840
 I've got to give my Saturday evening and I've got to sit on Zoom.

463
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:24,000
 I've got to plan on a weekday evening and then I've got this and I've got outreach.

464
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,680
 I'm going to give so many things to Jesus in my life.

465
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:36,440
 BC, once we recognize that our lives are only ours to give because he gave them to us first,

466
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,680
 that suddenly changes the way we think about it.

467
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,680
 That it were not for him giving us life, we wouldn't even have this life.

468
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,000
 And this is why when we go through suffering, when our health fails us,

469
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,840
 suddenly we realize, oh man, this wasn't mine to begin with.

470
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,440
 I have zero control over my life.

471
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,000
 Recognizing that our lives are in his hands.

472
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,960
 In fact, he is the one who drives it.

473
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,800
 And it makes our sacrifice seem less big, right?

474
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,680
 Once we recognize that we only have life because of him,

475
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,600
 that all things live through him, from him and for him.

476
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,280
 Makes me think of, it's really cute.

477
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,440
 So we give our kids pocket money and we give them a big amount every week.

478
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,240
 We give them $20 every week.

479
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,280
 Sometimes it's really cute.

480
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,160
 Once I've given it to them and they put it into their little chest, they were like,

481
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,920
 oh, I'll give you some.

482
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,440
 I'll give you some of my money.

483
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,280
 And it's really cute.

484
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,760
 And especially Alicia, sometimes she can't quite tell the difference.

485
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,440
 Sometimes she'll give me a brown note.

486
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,640
 Other times she'll give me a blue note and a red note.

487
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,160
 I really like it when she gives me the brown ones.

488
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,560
 And I was like, that's so cute.

489
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,720
 And of course, as a parent, I'm just filled with joy and warmth.

490
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,320
 Because it's special, especially cute, because it's my money anyway,

491
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,240
 because I gave it to them.

492
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,480
 But the heart, the joy that I receive from seeing how generous they can be,

493
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,320
 I'm like, ah, you get it.

494
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,880
 And often then I give it back to them, unless there's a brown one, then I keep it.

495
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,560
 Isn't that the same with God?

496
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,680
 He wants us to give him our whole lives, not because he's

497
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,800
 some terrible controlling dictator, because he knows that in giving,

498
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,000
 that's when you get the blessing.

499
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,040
 That's when you are truly released to be free.

500
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:29,640
 And it's just cute and lovely and warm for him

501
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,880
 to see us willing to surrender to him, because our lives are in his hands anyway.

502
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:40,320
 At least compared to the sacrifice that he gave us, what we're doing

503
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,040
 is just so small.

504
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,720
 But if we are willing to let go, know that he lives in us,

505
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,240
 and that only because of that do we live.

506
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,000
 Suddenly we're released and we get to live life to the full.

507
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,400
 He's not just the reason why we live.

508
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,920
 He's not the reason that we live for.

509
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,120
 He is the definition of living.

510
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,760
 In him was life.

511
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,880
 He is the only life.

512
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,800
 He's the driving force.

513
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,360
 So when people come to Jesus, they come to the one in whom

514
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,120
 the life of the Father is found.

515
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,160
 Jesus is the way to the Father.

516
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,000
 He's the only real and living way.

517
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 So that's it.

518
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,280
 He is the way, the truth, and the life.

519
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,560
 My question to all of you is, how much do you want this eternal life?

520
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,720
 Jesus says his Father's house has many rooms.

521
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,240
 It's a narrow path.

522
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,720
 I'm not going to lie, it's a narrow path.

523
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:37,240
 It's exclusive, but it's an inclusive kind of exclusivity.

524
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,920
 It's those who want it, get it.

525
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,440
 How much do you want this eternal life?

526
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:48,400
 As we sit here on a dreary April's Day, having gone through three months

527
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,280
 or three years, whatever you want to measure,

528
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,480
 of just times of being out of our control,

529
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,120
 the question really is, how much do you want this eternal life?

530
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,040
 How much do you want to go the way Jesus is going?

531
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,320
 How much do you want to know him?

532
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,560
 I think there's a couple of levels to this.

533
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,320
 And the first one is this.

534
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,080
 Do we even care enough to ask the same question that Thomas did?

535
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,320
 Some of you and some of us sometimes are like, you know what?

536
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,400
 It's also hard to understand.

537
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,280
 It's all too much commitment.

538
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,640
 If I take this too seriously, it's going to just turn my life upside down.

539
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,920
 I'm not even going to ask the question.

540
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,440
 And I pray for you to have the courage that Thomas did

541
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,240
 and to raise your hand awkwardly during the dinner and go,

542
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,320
 "Lord, we don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds good.

543
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,360
 How do we get there?

544
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,120
 What is this way?

545
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,920
 We don't understand."

546
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,640
 And so that's you.

547
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,160
 If this is, then I pray that you would want this,

548
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,360
 that you would want to know the way, that you would want to know Jesus

549
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,160
 beyond just sitting on a Zoom, beyond just sitting in a church service,

550
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,040
 that you would want to know him personally.

551
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,480
 Do you have a desire to go where Jesus is going, to know the Father?

552
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,360
 Does your physical posture, does the posture of your heart

553
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,040
 indicate that you desire this?

554
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,080
 That's the first question.

555
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,520
 That's a very important question.

556
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,920
 Search your heart.

557
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,560
 Is this something that you really want?

558
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,880
 If yes, then great.

559
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,840
 If not, then why not?

560
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:18,960
 What are you chasing?

561
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,920
 Which way are you going?

562
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,800
 What have you set in your Google Maps?

563
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,760
 Where are you heading?

564
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,800
 Is it going to lead you to the fulfillment that you think it's going to give you?

565
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,280
 I can tell you with honesty and humility, I don't think it will,

566
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,840
 because you weren't made for this world.

567
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,000
 You were made for another.

568
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,760
 So nothing in this world will satisfy that.

569
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,240
 Anyway, that's level one.

570
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,280
 May we have the desire to know him.

571
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,760
 One of my favorite songs I was talking to a friend about the other day

572
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,640
 by Shane and Shane called Yearn.

573
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,400
 It's like, "Lord, I want to yearn for you."

574
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,840
 Like, I don't even have that yet.

575
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,960
 I just want to yearn for you.

576
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,280
 What does that even look like?

577
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
 Ask that question.

578
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,760
 Ask just Jesus, just like Thomas did.

579
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,920
 "Lord, how do I know you?

580
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,640
 How do I know the way?"

581
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,920
 For those of us who have been around long enough,

582
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,200
 who have that heart to want to know him,

583
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,920
 the second question is this.

584
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,400
 Are we prepared for what that might mean when we know the truth?

585
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,080
 Can we handle the truth?

586
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,080
 As he declares that he goes to prepare a way for us,

587
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,240
 do we appreciate that road is one that we will have to take too?

588
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,200
 That way, that road that he took to get to his father's house,

589
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,880
 the one that we want to take as well,

590
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,800
 involves sacrifice and death.

591
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,960
 In order to achieve that victory in life,

592
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,520
 are we willing to follow him?

593
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,400
 You see, there's one thing to say we believe you.

594
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,000
 There's another thing to say we will follow you.

595
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,200
 Right?

596
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,960
 So level two is, am I willing to follow you?

597
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,760
 Jesus is the way to the father,

598
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,760
 primarily because his death made access to the father's presence

599
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,520
 to be possible for us,

600
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,240
 because we are so far away from him,

601
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,000
 way more than a human and dog.

602
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,840
 From human to God is just an indescribable jump.

603
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,640
 But because of Jesus, because of his death,

604
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,120
 there's now a way that has been made.

605
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,760
 He is the truth because he brought the truth of God

606
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,400
 into this world.

607
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,880
 And he alone possesses the life of God

608
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,560
 because he defeated death.

609
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,200
 And in him, we obtain that life.

610
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,480
 So my question for us is, do we care enough?

611
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,120
 Do we want enough to be able to handle what it takes

612
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,160
 to not just believe him, but to follow him?

613
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,520
 John 3, 16, the most famous passage,

614
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,120
 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son."

615
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,200
 His one and only son,

616
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,680
 because that son was the one and only way

617
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,880
 to this eternal life, to know him.

618
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,520
 And we often ask, "Why?

619
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,320
 Why does it have to be so hard?

620
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,200
 Jesus, why does it have to be so hard?"

621
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,720
 The other religions seem to do it easy.

622
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,040
 Just be a good person and just rack up your points and credits

623
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,560
 and eventually you get to the gate

624
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,160
 and it'll be enough and you get in.

625
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,760
 Because Jesus recognized how far short we fall,

626
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,720
 that we would never get there on our own.

627
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,040
 Acts 4, verse 12 says this,

628
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,080
 "And there is salvation in no one else, nothing else.

629
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,560
 For there is no other name under heaven given among men

630
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,880
 by which we must be saved.

631
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,960
 It is only Jesus."

632
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,680
 I want to finish by just emphasizing how radical that was

633
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,520
 for the people who believed that at the beginning.

634
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,680
 The Jews could not have believed this.

635
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,760
 See, for them, they can't worship any creative thing,

636
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
 physical or human.

637
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,240
 All the time, they're just worshiping this Yahweh, this I Am.

638
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,440
 They would have been the last people on earth

639
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,400
 to carry this message, that this human, this man,

640
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,080
 this Jesus was God himself.

641
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,200
 And yet that was exactly what was true.

642
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,440
 And so the question for us is,

643
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,080
 let's not concern ourselves with the questions,

644
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,120
 "Oh, Jesus being the only way sounds too exclusive

645
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,200
 and too arrogant."

646
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,760
 See, because we recognize that we are broken tools

647
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,920
 that are incapable of fixing ourselves.

648
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,320
 We could not have done it ourselves.

649
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,600
 Einstein said that the consciousness that created a problem

650
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,200
 can't be the one that solves it.

651
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,040
 We are the problem.

652
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,200
 So how can we solve ourselves?

653
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,120
 Whatever we do won't be enough.

654
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,880
 But Jesus, as the divine human, the Son of God,

655
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,920
 the sinless one, He came and He died, and then He conquered.

656
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,440
 He's the only name because He took the only way.

657
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,440
 Jesus himself asked God,

658
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,560
 "God, this is too hard.

659
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,240
 Like, if there's any other way

660
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,880
 for you to remove this cup of suffering, please do it."

661
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,760
 Even He asked.

662
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,000
 Yet He knew that this was the only way.

663
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,400
 There would have been no point in the cross

664
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,280
 if you could do something else about it.

665
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,320
 You said it yourself.

666
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,040
 There was no other way.

667
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,560
 So therefore there is no other name.

668
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,480
 He's the only way, the only truth,

669
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,720
 and the only one who gives life.

670
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,320
 Do you want Him?

671
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,720
 Do you want to know Him?

672
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,560
 I'm telling you, you should,

673
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,360
 because in Him, you will find life and life to the full.

674
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:07,120
 Let's pray and just surrender anything that's in our hearts,

675
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,880
 any directions that we're heading in,

676
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,800
 and give them back up to the only one who is the way.

677
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,320
 The only way to the Father is through Jesus.

678
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,160
 Let's pray.

679
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,120
 So Lord, I just, I thank you

680
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,240
 that you saw that we were heart of heart,

681
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,280
 that we simply didn't have the capacity to know you.

682
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,440
 And so you came in human form.

683
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,800
 You were the word that became flesh,

684
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,880
 that dwelt among men.

685
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,960
 And through you, we get to see the way,

686
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,720
 that the way is you.

687
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,080
 You are the goal of everything,

688
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,400
 and we seek you first,

689
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,800
 and that you are the only thing that's real.

690
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,800
 As this world spins around us,

691
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,080
 we don't even know what's true anymore,

692
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,800
 and fake news is, we hear more fake news than the truth.

693
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
 But you remind us Lord, that you are the truth,

694
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,400
 and you are the only reality that we should rely on.

695
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,800
 When we give you praise,

696
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,560
 we give you praise that in you we have life,

697
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,320
 and life to the full,

698
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,520
 because you are the only way to that life.

699
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,920
 So Lord, we put our hands up just like Thomas did.

700
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,520
 We don't know the way ourselves.

701
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,320
 We don't know you enough, but we want to.

702
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
 Show us Lord.

703
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,240
 Show us how to yearn for you.

704
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,680
 Show us how to love you as a deer pans for water.

705
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,800
 May we yearn for you in the same way.

706
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,160
 For you are the only way,

707
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,240
 the only thing that's true,

708
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,360
 and the only thing that gives life.

709
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,800
 We thank you Lord.

710
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,320
 It's in your name we pray, amen.
