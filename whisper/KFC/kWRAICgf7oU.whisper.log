[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (silence)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   Hello, Explorer!
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.000]   I know the pandemic is really bad in Hong Kong
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   but I hope this sermon will encourage you
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   to be a church of God
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   to continue to serve and pursue God.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   We are now in Explorer
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   talking about the Church series.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Last week, Pastor Irene told us
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   what the Church is.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   It's a fellowship of sinners.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   We all need Jesus to help us
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   to be our Savior.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Today, we are talking about what the Church is.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Church as the fellowship of the saints.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   In the book of Colossians, Paul tells us
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   "You have Jesus now.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Jesus has nailed the cross for you to die.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   So what?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   We have accepted Jesus as our Savior.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   So what?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   We will not wear the old clothes.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Do you like to wear the old clothes?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   The smelly clothes from the winter.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   The clothes from yesterday.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Do you like to wear them?
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Of course not.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   They smell bad, right?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Paul says, "Don't wear the old clothes.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   You have to wear new clothes.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   The old clothes are sins.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   What are they?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   They are sins, they are temptations.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   But Paul wants you to wear new clothes.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   New clothes are beautiful, right?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Are they beautiful?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   These are not new.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   But Paul wants us to wear new clothes.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   What are new clothes?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   We will look at Colossians 3, verse 12-17.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   So you are the chosen ones of God, pure and unselfish people.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   You must wear the new clothes.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Therefore, you are humble, gentle, and patient.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   If this person and that person have a grudge,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   they must be patient and forgive each other.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   The Lord has forgiven you,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   and you must also forgive him.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   In addition, you must wear the new clothes,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   because love is universal.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   You must let the peace that Christ bestows
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   dwell in your hearts,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   and for this reason you must be one.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You must also have a heart of gratitude.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   When you use all kinds of wisdom
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   to enrich the heart with the truth of Christ,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   use the verses of Psalms, Psalms, and Psalms to teach each other,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   to advise each other,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   and to plant the heart of gratitude.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Whatever you do,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   whatever you say or do,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   you must do it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Wearing the new clothes is a way of being grateful.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Yes, just now Paul told us
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   "You put on"
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   "Put on" these different things.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   He asked us what kind of people we are.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   We are God's chosen people.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Right?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   We are holy.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   If there are so many people in the church
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   who have accepted Jesus Christ,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   who are holy,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   then this is a very good place.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Today I have seven points
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   about what quality our church has.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   First, the church is a place where we treat each other
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   as Christ does.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Verse 12 says, "Put on then as God's chosen people,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   holy and beloved,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   compassionate hearts,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   kindness, humility, meekness, patience."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Wow, if our church
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   has compassionate hearts,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   kindness, humility, meekness, patience,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   isn't that a very good place?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   We see Jesus Christ,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   he sees those 5,000 people
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   who are poor,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   who have nothing to eat,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   who are hungry,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   he has compassion towards them.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   He shows kindness towards them.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   He fed the 5,000.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   He sees those prostitutes,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   who are not liked by anyone,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   who want to throw stones at them,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   those adulterers,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   what does he do?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   He shows kindness towards them.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Kindness towards them.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   First, the church is a place
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   where we treat each other
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   as Christ does.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Second, the church is a place
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   where we forgive one another.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Verse 11, "Bearing with one another,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   if one has a complaint against another,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   forgive each other,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   as the Lord has forgiven you,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   so you also must forgive."
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Paul tells us,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Jesus has forgiven us.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   God has forgiven us.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   He has nailed the cross for us.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   In the story,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Jesus and the adulterer,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   everyone wants to throw him into the ground,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   because he committed a sin.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Jesus tells him,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   "If you have no sin,
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   you throw the stone."
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   But what is the result?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   No one throws the stone.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Why?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Because everyone knows they have sinned.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   If they have no sin,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   they will throw the stone.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   He tells the adulteress woman,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   "Has anyone thrown the stone?"
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   "No."
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   "I will also forgive you."
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   "Neither will I."
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   "Go and leave your life of sin."
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Church is a place where everyone is a sinner.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   We all have to accept one another,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   and forgive one another.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Third, church is a place where we love with unity.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Love with unity.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   In verse 14, it says,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   "Above all these things, put on love,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   which binds everything together
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   in perfect harmony."
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Love brings us together.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Love helps us to accept one another.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Love is the most important thing.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   God first loved us.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   We must love one another.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Fourth, church is a place of peace.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   In verse 15, it says,
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   "Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   The peace of God, Jesus Christ,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   must rule in our lives.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   During this pandemic,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   do we have the peace of God, Jesus Christ?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   This peace will bring us together as one body.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   One body.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Fifth, church is a place of thankfulness.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Paul calls us to be thankful.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   When we are in church,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   when we are in the Explorer,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   do we have thankfulness?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Do we have gratitude?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   God says, "Wow, we can be together,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   have a time of unity,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   read the Bible together,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   play together,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   have a time to pray together."
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   When we are in church,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   do we have gratitude?
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Are we thankful?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Sixth, what is church?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Church is a place where the Word of God
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   is the foundation.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   The Word of God is our foundation.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   We are in the Explorer,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   we read the Bible,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   we have sermons,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   we pray,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   everything,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   everything is the foundation of the Word of God.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   When we preach,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   what is our foundation?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   It's not our own inspiration.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Our inspiration is the Word of God.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   We hope, we explore,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   the foundation,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   we worship,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   we sing,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   whatever we do,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   the foundation is the Word of God.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Seventh,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   last,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   church is a place where everything is done for Christ.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   In verse 17 it says,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   "And whatever you do,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   in deed or word,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   giving thanks to God the Father through Him."
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We are in church,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   whatever we do,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   we do it for the name of Jesus.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Jesus is for Jesus.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Then we, in everything that we do,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   we must glorify God,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   worship Jesus.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Then we recap,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   the church is a place where we treat each other as Christ does.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Church is a place where we forgive one another.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Church is a place where we love in unity.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Church is a place of peace, of thankfulness.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Church is a place where God's Word is the foundation.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And the church is a place where everything is done for Jesus Christ.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Wow, if we can do this kind of church,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   isn't it an amazing place?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   What a great place!
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Right?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Now we will invite Sophia to share her experience.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Hello everyone, I am Sophia.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I am an intern at the church this year.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I am 18 years old and I am studying in England.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   What I like most about the church is that
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   we can strengthen our relationship with God in the church.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Every Sunday we sing to God,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   and after listening to the sermon, we have a discussion.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   This is to prevent me from deviating from the path that God has chosen for me.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And I think it is easier to make friends in the church than in school.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I just finished saying that the church is a place where we treat others as Christ does.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I think we all experience God's love without conditions.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   It is easier to have more love and care for others.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And it is less judgmental.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   We can make the church great again.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I think I can make more effort to improve my relationship with God.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   And I can pay more attention to others.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   We thank Sophia for her testimony.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   If we can do this at 7pm,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   isn't the church an amazing place?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   A great place.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Now I have four points.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   How to make our church great again.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Upward, inward, outward, downward.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   First, upward.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   We need to focus on our relationship with God.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   If we are closer to God,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   we will become more like Jesus.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   We can love those around us.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Love those who are difficult.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   We can have compassion to care for others.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Become more like Jesus.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   First, look upward.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Second, look inward.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   We need to look at ourselves.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   We all have weaknesses.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   We all have different places that make us angry.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   We are very angry.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   We need to be aware of our weaknesses.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Look inward.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Third, we need to look at our weaknesses.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   What do we need to do?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Look outward.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   We need to make a plan.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   When we run, we see a point.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   We have a focus.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   When we make a plan, we need to have a focus.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   We see our weaknesses.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   How can we take initiative to help our church?
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   To love those around us.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   We need to have a plan to care for our church.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Fourth, look downward.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Look to give, not receive.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   John F. Kennedy told the United States,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   "Do not look to what your country can do for you,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   but look to what you can do for your country."
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   We are the same in church.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   We don't always say, "Oh, what can the church give us?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   What can we take?"
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   But if we are truly following Jesus,
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   we will look to give to the church.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Give to one another.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   We need to look downward.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   We need to see where our feet are going.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   We need to give our best to Jesus.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   To serve.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   To use our gifts to serve our church.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I remember when I first entered college,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   I experienced a group at college.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Wow, we went out to preach together.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   We cared for each other.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   We studied, we had many difficulties.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   We had relationships.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   We prayed for our friends.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   We served together.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   We organized fellowship campaigns at college.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   This was the first time I experienced
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   an amazing fellowship.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Church is an amazing place.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   I hope that we, as Explorers,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   can do this 7-point.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   To love one another.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   To forgive one another.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   To love one another.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Church is a place of peace,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   of thankfulness.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   The Word of God is our foundation.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And everything we do is for Jesus.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   God bless you.
