[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.320]   Thank you Michelle for that kind introduction. Tonight I'm not going to preach so much as
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:22.440]   prophesy. Now I know what you're thinking, has Pastor John gone weird? But I just want
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:31.760]   to debunk and describe what prophecy actually is. That prophecy is not so much predicting
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:43.400]   the future as speaking God's word for the moment. Prophecy is forth telling as much
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:54.200]   as foretelling. And it may simply be defined as speaking forth, speaking out God's word
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:04.440]   to those whom God has desired to hear it. God, through scripture and through his people,
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:17.280]   continues to speak today. And he wants to use us to strengthen, encourage and comfort
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:31.960]   each other. I believe that God in the year 2020 is still saying, "Dear Church." And
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.440]   that is the title of our 8 week series in the book of Revelation and will encompass
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:52.760]   the first three chapters of Revelation. Revelation is a book of prophecy. We will be studying
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:07.440]   seven letters to the seven churches. They are prophetic letters. Now look at this, "On
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:18.400]   the Lord's day I was in the spirit and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet which
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:33.640]   said write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus, to Smyrna,
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:47.400]   to Pergamum, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia and Laodicea." And here we see a map of those
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:58.520]   seven churches. The obscure and extravagant imagery of the book of Revelation has led
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:14.320]   to a wide variety of Christian interpretations. Historicists, Preterists, Idealists and Futurists.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:25.000]   Now don't get hung up on four big words. The table in front of you explains them a little
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.480]   bit. Historicist interpretations see Revelation as containing a broad view of history. To
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:43.200]   put it another way, the historicist aligns historical events with what is described in
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:53.760]   Revelation. Whilst Preterists interpretations treat Revelation as mostly referring to the
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.380]   events of the first century, to the apostolic age or at least to the fall of the Roman Empire.
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.960]   In other words, they believe that the prophecies in Revelation have already been fulfilled.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:17.840]   Thirdly, the idealist or should we say symbolic interpretations consider that Revelation does
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:25.200]   not refer to actual people or events but it is an illustration of the spiritual path and
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:34.240]   the ongoing struggle between good and evil. Futurists meanwhile believe that Revelation
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:42.320]   describes future events with the seven churches growing into the body of believers throughout
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:54.240]   the age. You might be asking yourself which approach is correct? Well, each one is true
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:03.240]   in some regard. The book of Revelation did speak to John's day. It speaks to church history.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:10.960]   It does have meaning for our personal life. And while elements of the first three approaches
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:21.040]   have their place, we cannot deny the place of the futurist view. We can know that the
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:31.240]   book of Revelation speaks with clarity about what we call end times because of two central
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:43.640]   principles drawn from Revelation 1, 1-3. Firstly, we believe that the book of Revelation must
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.880]   mean something. This is a book that Jesus gave to show his servant something. It is
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:06:00.240]   not a book of meaningless nonsense. It has a promise of blessing, not a promise of confusion.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:11.440]   And secondly, we believe that Revelation definitely claims to contain predictive prophecy. John
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:18.520]   made it clear. He spoke about things which must shortly take place. He said the time
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:29.240]   is near. John wrote about events that were still future to him. But what about the church
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:41.440]   today? I believe this is possibly one of the most significant times in church history.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:52.880]   Are we a church in crisis with all that's going on? Or are we a church in opportunity?
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:01.760]   I believe we have a choice. We can either get on with what we know as church, doing
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:08.640]   things that we've always done in the way that we've always done them. People say to me,
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:16.920]   "Pastor John, I can't wait to get back to church the way it was." Or do we use this
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:30.960]   season to listen to what God is saying as he speaks the word, "Dear Church." And to
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:39.240]   help me, I want to look closely at the first few words of Revelation chapter 1. Let me
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:49.240]   read them. "The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave him to show his servants things
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:59.840]   which must shortly take place." Let's pick this apart. Firstly, the revelation of Jesus
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:10.960]   Christ. Now the ancient Greek word which is translated "revelation" is "apokalipsis"
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:24.920]   means the apocalypse. This word simply means a revealing or an unveiling. The book of Revelation
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:32.040]   is the revelation of Jesus Christ in the sense that it belongs to him. He is the one doing
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:41.000]   the revealing. It is also Jesus' revelation in the sense that he is the object revealed.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:53.480]   Jesus is the person revealed by the book. From the outset, we are given the most important
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:00.560]   truth about the book of Revelation. Yes, this book shows us the Antichrist. Yes, it shows
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:07.920]   us God's judgment. Yes, it shows us calamity on the earth. And yes, it shows us the mystery
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:20.120]   Babylon in vivid detail. But most of all, it is the revelation of Jesus Christ to us.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:32.640]   If we catch everything else but miss Jesus in the book, we miss the book of Revelation.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:43.760]   And I want to say to us KFCI, how we need a revelation of Jesus. What is Jesus to you?
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:50.240]   A person in a book? A good man? A worker of miracles? An upmarket Santa Claus that you
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:59.880]   can pray to with your shopping list? I'm praying for you right now that he would reveal himself
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:14.040]   to you as a saviour, lord, healer, deliverer. But what was the reason for the book of Revelation?
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:22.440]   The answer is in this phrase, "which God gave him to show his servants." This is an important
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:30.520]   reason why God the Father gave the revelation of Jesus Christ. He gave it to show his servants.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:38.240]   God gave this revelation that it might be shown, not hidden. This is an apocalypse,
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:47.480]   a revelation, not an apocrypha, something hidden. But what was God the Father through
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:11:01.720]   Jesus showing? He was showing things which must shortly take place. This describes when
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:07.160]   the events will take place. They will happen shortly and they must happen shortly. This
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:15.000]   means the book of Revelation is a book of predictive prophecy. It speaks of things that
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:22.560]   will happen in the future, at least in the future, at the time of writing. According
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:30.000]   to Revelation 1, verse 3, the time is near for the fulfilment of these things but the
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:41.280]   time was not present at the time of writing. Now let me explain. Short and near are relative
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:52.520]   terms and my friends this is God's timetable, not man's. Yet for 2,000 years history has
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:58.840]   been on the brink of consummation of all things, running parallel to the edge, not running
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:10.000]   towards a distant brink. The Greek phrase for shortly literally means quickly or suddenly
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:18.800]   coming to pass. The idea is not that the event may occur soon but that when it does it will
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:33.040]   be sudden. I just want us to be ready. Now God had a harsh word for nearly all of the
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:40.320]   seven churches. I don't want to do a spoiler alert tonight but recommend the next seven
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:52.560]   weeks. But God also had a promise to the conqueror in both the NIV and the ESV. He talks about
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:13:03.680]   to the one who conquers. It's like if we've got a habit in everyday life. When we conquer
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:17.640]   it our life is different before than after. But tonight I want to cover what I believe
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:31.120]   that God may be saying to the church now. And I would submit that God may be saying
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:44.320]   this. To the church in 2020 there is no new normal. I hold this against you. You keep
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:56.800]   saying I want to get back to church. But the church you want to get back to does not exist.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:08.960]   Listen to my voice. I've drawn a little picture with Bonnie's help of highway 2020, freeway
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:18.280]   2020, motorway 2020. Call it what you like. But let's look at it just for a moment as
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:29.600]   I speak. Let me explain. We were able to by God's grace start KFCI in October 1996. No
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:43.920]   it was October 2016. I had a senior moment then. And our history up until 2019 was fairly
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:54.800]   smooth sailing. We were building momentum. We were going into something. And then in
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:06.960]   a few years accidents, obstacles, things got in our way. We saw firstly the political protests.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.120]   I remember one Saturday evening preaching here when there were virtually cocktails,
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:19.480]   Molotov cocktails going on outside our building. Then we had and have COVID-19. And then we
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:28.000]   had the political differences in our city. I believe we're at a point in our church and
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:37.200]   the church worldwide where we have a choice. We can go back to the way things were and
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:44.560]   there is definitely a path that leads back there. Or we can look forward. Now I need
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:55.320]   to warn you the way forward is dangerous. It's bumpy. There are warning signals out
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:08.120]   there. But I just want to say this. The temptation is to go back. Retrace our roots. Go back
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:20.720]   to the familiar path. It is the easy option. God I believe is warning us against this.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:35.520]   I believe it is simply not an option if we are to fulfil God's vision for our church.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:43.600]   Because almost 100% of Hong Kong is linked by technology as we are using technology this
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:53.320]   evening. I want to use some technological type words to demonstrate what I believe God
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:17:06.840]   is encouraging us to do when he says the words "Dear Church". Firstly and importantly I believe
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:19.940]   God is saying "Church do not push the repeat button". Let me say that again. Do not press
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:28.440]   the repeat button. Isaiah 43 says "Forget the former things. Do not dwell on the past.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:38.760]   See behold I am doing a new thing". We often talk about the good old days. Until we realise
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:47.280]   that the good old days probably weren't so good after all. But what does doing a new
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:18:03.200]   thing entail? What is God's mandate to us today? I want to continue the theme of ours
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:13.760]   as I share what I believe God is saying to KFCI. To the church that we see in 2020. And
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:29.160]   the first is this. Reset. Can I repeat that? Reset. It means to set again or to set differently.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:38.480]   Alternative words I could have used were to change, to reappraise, to adjust. I believe
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:48.840]   we can consider that God's finger is on the reset button. I could quite easily use the
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:19:00.160]   word reboot. But 2020 has made this more of a necessity than an option. I think we've
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:11.520]   had more services online this year than live. We've experimented with pre-recorded sermons,
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:19.440]   pre-recorded services, live stream, zoom worship like this evening. And I want to thank all
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:30.880]   those in our congregation who have made these possible. We've missed face to face. But church
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:39.320]   attendance here and around the world, albeit measured by clicks and likes, has actually
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:47.240]   increased. We have attracted attendees from all across the world. With some weeks up to
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:57.080]   500 views on YouTube for our Saturday evening service. To be honest with you, people have
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:06.120]   gotten used to doing church in their shorts and not have to travel on the MTR, on the
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:14.920]   bus or park the car. Let's face it, in Hong Kong that's expensive to attend a church service.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:24.080]   We do need to change, reappraise and adjust. We need to start anew with fresh ideas in
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:35.760]   the way that is consistent with who we are as KFC. But not necessarily constrained by
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:48.640]   what has taken place before. And the fact is this, online is something we will be seeing
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:58.760]   more and more globally in the future. And we have to decide, not how we can fight it,
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:06.920]   but how we can use it to our advantage. I want to recommend a book to you. It's a book
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:16.640]   called "From Social Media to Social Ministry". It was written by Nona Jones. You'll want
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:30.120]   to read it cover to cover. But in any event, KFCI, we need to reset. And after we have
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:44.760]   reset, we need to renew. Now renew can mean resume an activity after an interruption or
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:57.080]   to give fresh life and fresh strength to. Church, this is the key. It's the same word.
[00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:06.160]   But do we resume an activity after an interruption? Or do we give fresh life and strength to it?
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:17.280]   I believe that God is calling us to the latter. The alternative meanings are to refresh, to
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:28.680]   rejuvenate, to renovate and to restore. These are words of renewal. Look at this. It's taken
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:40.080]   from Isaiah 40. But those who hope or alternatively those who wait on the Lord will renew their
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:47.400]   strength. They will soar on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:23:05.800]   walk and not grow faint. Church, the core is clear. Reset. Renew. Now to be honest,
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:15.360]   I was tempted to say next, restore. Certainly it's a computer term, restore to factory setting.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:21.120]   It's a biblical term. It's mentioned over a hundred times in the Bible. But I have a
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:31.320]   stronger word with a similar meaning and it's been on my heart for quite a while. Restore
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:44.640]   can mean that you go back to what you've had before. So I've chosen the word revive. Revive
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:55.040]   means to restore to life or restore to consciousness. I've had a stirring in my bones for quite
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:02.520]   a while with the political situation, with COVID-19, with all that is going on around
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:14.080]   the world. That God is about to bring a revival. But what do I mean by this? The Psalmist asked
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:22.480]   this in Psalm 85, "Will you not revive us again that your people may rejoice in you?"
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:30.960]   The Psalmist is asking God for revival so that once again the people can rejoice in
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:41.480]   God. Now where does revival begin? And can I just say tonight, if you are not a Christian,
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:49.120]   you can't be revived because firstly you've got to be vibed. You've got to be made alive
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:25:00.080]   to Christ. Can I commend that to you tonight? But if you're a believer, I invite you to
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:10.920]   draw a circle around where you are standing. And I want to tell you this, revival starts
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:24.240]   within that circle. The word, the Hebrew word for revive is "chayah" and means to be quickened,
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:34.680]   to be made alive, to be restored. Showing what I just said. You must first be quickened
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:47.240]   or made alive by the Spirit of God before revival can occur. And this takes a new birth,
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:26:00.440]   a new birth in Him. But the word that keeps coming to me is "awakening." I am 67 years
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:15.040]   of age and I'm fed up with hearing stories about past awakenings. I want to see one now.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:32.400]   My friends, it will not come if we repeat. But let us reset, reboot, renew. We can do
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:50.680]   this but God is the only one who can revive. But I've not finished yet. There is another
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:27:03.640]   hour left. And it's this word "reconciliation." I'll say it again. Reconciliation. The past
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:15.640]   year or so has resulted in a society that is divided and isolated. There has never been
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:27.240]   more polarization than that which we see now. Young and old, rich and poor, Republican or
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:39.680]   Democrat, blue or yellow, I could go on. Two things I believe God's saying to us. Be reconciled
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:52.240]   to Jesus, oh yes, but be reconciled to each other. And I want to honor here Florence Lau
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:59.760]   and others who have encouraged me in this area of reconciliation. I want to read you
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:09.280]   a passage from Paul's letter to the Corinthians, from 2 Corinthians 5. So from now on we regard
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:15.360]   no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:23.880]   so no longer. Therefore if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come. The old is gone.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:33.360]   The new is here. All this is from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ and
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:43.520]   gave to us the ministry of reconciliation. That God was reconciling the world to himself
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:56.720]   in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:05.280]   of reconciliation. We are therefore Christ's ambassadors. As though God was making his
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:22.160]   appeal through us, we implore you on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God. Now I have a
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:33.520]   fairly hard word now. Don't even begin to think about fulfilling God's vision in renewing
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:43.520]   our church before we fulfill the prayer of Jesus in John 17. He said this, "My prayer
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:50.000]   is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:01.520]   that all of them may be one Father just as you are in me and I am in you." My concluding
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:14.480]   comments are these. There is no new normal. I hold this against you. You keep saying,
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:22.640]   "I want to go back to church." But the church you want to get back to doesn't exist.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:38.240]   Listen to my voice. To him who resets, reboots, renews, refreshes, I will make him or her
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:56.080]   an agent of reconciliation. My friend, will you hear God's voice today? A friend wrote
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:05.920]   to me last year. He said this, "The trip of a lifetime ended, landed in my lap. I visited
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:15.200]   the seven churches of Revelation. A friend and I flew to Izmir, Turkey, where we rented
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:29.760]   a car and we drove to all seven churches in a quick three-day trip. In the end, we saw
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:42.080]   a lot of rocks." Now don't get me wrong, they were beautiful rocks. But they were rocks,
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:51.200]   ancient ruins of cities that were once teeming with people long ago, rather like Hong Kong
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:32:05.120]   is now. In the Apostle John's vision of Revelation, Jesus spoke to Christians in these cities,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:20.240]   commending some but warning most. My question is this, do we want to be a church, a city
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:37.600]   with a lasting legacy or do we want to be a pile of rocks? That's my question. Hear
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   what God is saying to his church. Let me pray. Father God, we thank you for the book of Revelation.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:58.160]   We thank you Lord that you chose to speak to those seven churches and the churches throughout
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:05.560]   the ages through the words that you spoke to the Apostle John. And we thank you Lord
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:15.480]   that you are still speaking to your church today. I pray Lord that we will have the grace
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:22.440]   to hear your voice and Lord that you would cause us to respond. For those of us who are
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:31.080]   not yet believers, Lord that tonight we would make a decision to repent, to turn to you
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:37.600]   and to give our life to you. And for those of us who are believers, that we wouldn't
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:45.360]   be looking to go back to those things that we knew, those familiar things. And Lord that
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:53.560]   you would set our path down the road and we know it's going to be difficult to reset,
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:34:03.720]   to renew and to revive. That Lord that you would bring your church in 2020 here in Hong
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:15.120]   Kong and around the world to a revival. God we proclaim that you are sovereign over us.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:24.440]   May your sovereign power flow through your church right now in Jesus name. Amen.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:34.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
