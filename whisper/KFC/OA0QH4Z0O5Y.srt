1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Good evening to everyone at home.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 It's been a strange, strange start to the Chinese New Year.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 I think my wife was just reflecting yesterday.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 It's nearly the middle of February already.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 What's happened to this year?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 What's going on?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 But you know what?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 I'm still grateful, still grateful that we get to share the word of God.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And hopefully, well, hopefully, first of all, that you are physically safe and physically healthy at home.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 We know that we've been hit with a whole new wave of cases recently.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 But on top of that, I hope that you feel spiritually fed, spiritually fed in the sense that even this, this isn't ideal.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 This isn't plan A, B or C.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 But hopefully, at least, it's still better than nothing.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And that actually, even through the Internet, we can be a blessing to you.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 We can minister to you in some way.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And also, emotionally healthy.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 You know, it's, actually the title of today's message, I actually tweaked a little bit, and it's called "I am not".

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And I'll explain a bit more about what "I am not" means later.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 But it, you know, as we were just singing and just preparing, and what John shared, just made me think, you know what?

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 It's also okay during a time like this to say, "I am not okay".

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 We're going through unprecedented times.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 This is the most cases we've had in the last two years.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 There's so much uncertainty.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And I don't know about you, but I think I'll be the first to admit that actually, things have not been great.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Even just sometimes sitting back and just reflecting, "Man, I'm not sure I'm okay".

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 And I don't know whether you guys have that or not, but I feel as though, if there's anyone out there, any of us who actually have that sentiment,

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 "You know what? These last two years, or last three years for Hong Kong, have just been too much.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And we're not even allowed to get out. I am not okay".

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And I think if there's anything I want you to get out of this message, it's okay to say that, to say, "I am not okay".

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And then to reach out, maybe even now, maybe even as I'm speaking, maybe as I'm introducing this message, reach out to someone,

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 go, "Hey, you know what? I know that we probably shouldn't meet face to face right now, but can we just talk on the phone for a little bit?

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 I just wanted to share. I don't think I'm fully there. I'm not okay".

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 And I want that to just be a prompt for any of us who have that, "I am not".

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Because being emotionally healthy is so important.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And I feel as though this message, during this time, we, John, when you assigned this season to be talking about this,

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 you had no idea that this was going to be what we were going to be facing.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And yet it's so important.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 We're still praying for, we're still dreaming for an emotionally healthy church.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 And yet to get an emotionally healthy church, we must have emotionally healthy individuals.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 So then the key is, are we as individuals emotionally healthy?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 And as I was reflecting on the passage that I'm going to be preaching on today, the person in the Bible we're going to be looking at,

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 the thing that really hit me about being emotionally healthy is that you need to have emotionally healthy expectations.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 You need to have good expectations of what, you know, we're all hoping for different things.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 We're hoping for COVID to go down. We're hoping for schools to open back up.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 We're hoping that we can go out and meet our families and friends.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And we're hoping that we can get to fly out of Hong Kong, at least for a little bit.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Of course, right now, those may not be healthy expectations, given the situation that we have.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 But to have healthy expectations is the beginning to being emotionally healthy.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And in order to have emotionally healthy expectations, we actually need to have a healthy perception of ourselves.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 How many of us can say that we have that? That we have an emotionally healthy perception of ourselves?

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 We know who we are. We know our own identity. We know our own purpose.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 More importantly, we know our own limits. We know what we can't control.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 We know the things that actually are completely out of our control that we have to surrender.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 You see, we need to recognise those, because when we recognise those, when we know our identity, our person, our limits,

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 then we have healthy expectations. And when we have healthy expectations, that's when we start to become emotionally healthy as individuals.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And then when we become emotionally healthy as individuals, then we as a church body have the chance to be emotionally healthy.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 To have an accurate perception of self is maybe where it starts.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Now that really is called, we know what that word is, it's actually humility.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 The word there is actually humility. Someone has once said that pride is basically taking credit for something that you don't deserve.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Having an over-inflated or even an under-inflated view of yourself is what pride is.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 It's not knowing who you are. But knowing, when you know your true worth, then you are humble.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 But the problem is this. Humility is so, so hard to grasp. So hard to get.

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 There's another quote that I love is, "Humility is such a rare trait that once you think you grasp it, you've lost it."

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Humility is such a rare trait that once you think you've grasped it, that's the moment that you've lost it.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Of course we've all heard the very popular quote, "Humility is not thinking any less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less."

66
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 And to start to think about how we can become emotionally healthy, I think it actually, the road begins with humility.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 It begins with us looking at ourselves, but also then recognising it's not about ourselves.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 But we're currently surrounded by a society that is, I guess you could even say narcissistic in the way we approach things.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Everything, everything is about us. Everything is about what we can do, how we can thrive, how we can strive for the next level for us.

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And yet what we see is we're surrounded by brokenness. We're surrounded by just people just hurting and in pain.

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Certainly a couple of days ago we heard about the former Miss USA, who became a lawyer, who took her own life at the age of 30.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 And this was an individual who was perceived to have everything, and yet at 30 she felt that there was no more hope, there was no more purpose to live.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 And then she gave it all up.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 At the very least that tells you this pursuit of just satisfying your own CV, of building it up, of puffing it up, of focusing on yourself, isn't actually enough.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 It doesn't give you the joy that you're looking for.

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 You Too has a song, "You've still not found what you're searching for."

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And so where do we get that true joy from? Where do we get that ultimate satisfaction from?

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 It's ultimately when we look beyond ourselves.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 And as we look beyond ourselves, we're going to look into the Bible, and we're going to look into the book of John.

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And there's a character I want to talk to you about who shows immense humility.

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 And it's not someone that you actually think first would be the person you'd use to talk about humility.

82
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 And that is John the Baptist.

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 John the Baptist is someone who is actually emotionally healthy and also a true display of humility.

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Why, you ask?

85
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Because John the Baptist, from the account we see in Scripture, was a pretty crazy man.

86
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 He spent most of his time in the wilderness.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 He used camel's hair as a jacket.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 He ate locusts and wild honey.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And he went around shouting at people.

90
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 And you're like, "Oh, well, he's entitled to do what he wants to, but I wouldn't call him humble."

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 And yet, actually, despite all the things that he shouted out, all the things that he said,

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 you know what his life's cry is, if I was to sum up, if I dared to even try to sum up what John the Baptist's life was about?

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 It would be in one sentence, and it's this.

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 It's not about me. It's about him.

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 He would write on his grave, as I hazard a guess, would be, "It wasn't about me. It's all about him."

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And as I was reflecting on his story, I was like, "Those are the only words that came to my mind.

97
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 It's not about us. It's about him."

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 And so today, I want to talk about, I want to unpack what he says.

99
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 I want to look at how it's humble and how it will help us become emotionally healthy.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 And really, the key, the landing point of all of this, the one sentence I want you ringing in your minds as you leave is,

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 "It's not about me. It's about him."

102
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 But before I jump into that, I recognize there's two people who are listening.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 There's two types of people who are listening, whether online or whether here.

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And the first type is this.

105
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 You don't truly know your worth in Jesus yet.

106
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Maybe you're not a believer yet.

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Maybe you haven't committed your life to him.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Maybe you're not in a relationship with him.

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And to you, I want to say, you are of ultimate worth.

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 You are of so much worth.

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 You are loved so dearly.

112
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 You are fearfully and wonderfully made.

113
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 So much worth that Jesus, the Son of God, the Prince of Heaven, deemed you worthy enough to sacrifice himself for you.

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 And I want you to know that, that you are that valuable.

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 You may have spent your life being neglected.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 You may have spent your life not being seen or not being respected or heard.

117
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 I want you to know how valuable you are in the eyes of God and how much he loves you.

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 You're the first group.

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 The second group of people is those of us who actually know God, know Jesus, know that we're Christians.

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And to you, I want to say something else.

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 To others, I want to say something else, and that's this.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 It's not about you.

123
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 It's all about God.

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 You see, so often, even in our own Christian lives, we've made it about us.

125
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 God, what do you want me to do?

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 What's the thing that you want me to carry out for you?

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 How am I going to find satisfaction?

128
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 God, you give me peace.

129
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 It's all about me.

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 And I want to tell you, beloved brothers and sisters, it's not about you.

131
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 It's about him.

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 It's not about me.

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 It's about him.

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 And in order for us to take on that journey, we have to figure out, to get to that point

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 where we recognise it's not about us, we have to do three things.

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 We have to know our own identity, we have to know our own limits, and we have to know our own purpose.

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Just like John the Baptist.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 And next slide will show, as we look at John the Baptist, why was he humble?

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 It was because he knew his own identity.

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 He knew his own limits, and he knew his own purpose.

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 That's why the title of the sermon is "I Am Not."

142
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And today we'll just jump straight in and we'll unpack these three points, and I hope the message that carries through is,

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 it's not about us.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 It's not about our own goals and our own ambitions.

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 You can take everything else, just give me the one that truly matters.

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 Jesus.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 And so we jump straight in.

148
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 John the Baptist knows his own identity.

149
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 John chapter 1, verse 19, and it says this.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 "And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him,"

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 three words, "Who are you?"

152
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 A little bit of context here.

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 John the Baptist is growing a bit of a fan base.

154
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 He's getting quite popular.

155
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 He may be crazy, but people are following him.

156
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 And they're going out into the wilderness to find him, to be shouted at, and to repent, and to be baptised.

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 So he's getting a following.

158
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 So at that point, the Jews, the Pharisees, they're like, "Well, who is this guy?"

159
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Now, they're used to this because they feel their mission is to basically clump out and exterminate any false messiahs.

160
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 So they send these priests and these Levites to go out to him, and they ask him three words, "Who are you?"

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 And John the Baptist looks at them, knowing what they're really asking.

162
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 Because what they're really asking is, "Wait, are you a prophet?

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Are you a messiah?

164
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Who are you?"

165
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Really, they're asking two things.

166
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 "Who are you, and what is your business here?"

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 "Mai masui a?

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Nei ma gau ma la?"

169
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 Is what they're asking.

170
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Because they're seeing this following, and they're like, "This is threatening to us."

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 And then, he doesn't tell them who he is.

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 And he says, it's not on the slides, he confessed and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."

173
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 So instead of saying who he is, which he could say, "Hey, I am John, son of Elizabeth, son of Zechariah.

174
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 I am a Baptist by trade.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 I'm a bit of a crazy man.

176
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 I prefer camel's hair on my skin."

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 He doesn't say any of those things.

178
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 He goes straight into the heart of why they're asking.

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And he says, "I am not the Christ."

180
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And then they go, "Well, okay, if you're not the Christ, then who are you?

181
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 Are you a prophet? Are you Elijah?"

182
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 He's like, "No, no, no, no, I am not any of those things."

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And then what does he say?

184
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 He says, in verse 23, he said, "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness.

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 Make straight the way of the Lord," as the prophet Isaiah said.

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 So he roots his answer of who he is in Scripture.

187
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 He didn't tell them anything else, but he says, "Who I am can be found in the word of God, and this is who I am.

188
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 I am the voice.

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 I am just the voice of one crying out in the desert.

190
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 Make straight the way of the Lord."

191
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 So his answer is all about rooted identity in Scripture.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 I wonder if someone asked us, "Who are you?"

193
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Maybe recently someone has asked you, "Oh, who are you?"

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 How would you respond?

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 So often in society right now, when we're asked that question, depending on context, we'll be like,

196
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 "Well, I am James, son of Nelson. I'm a pastor. I do this, I do that. I'm Chinese. I like Chinese food."

197
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And then you tell them all the things about you.

198
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 But here's the thing. If we don't know our true identity, that's when we'll start to lose our way.

199
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 That's when we'll lose our humility because we'll either become too prideful or too insecure.

200
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 And then when we do that, we're heading towards emotional unhealthiness.

201
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 But the question is, when you are asked, "Who are you?"

202
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 What is the first thing that you say?

203
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Your social media profile, your Instagram account.

204
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Because you're asked to put your name and then you're asked to give a little bio of yourself.

205
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 What do you write there?

206
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 What is the first thing that you write there?

207
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 What do you do?

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 In our circles, it's probably my name and what I do.

209
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 But what's your prime identity?

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Because identity is so important.

211
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And John here seems to get it right.

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 He knows exactly who he is. He roots his answer in Scripture.

213
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 For us, who are we?

214
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 See, identity is so important.

215
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Even the world outside who don't know God know how important it is.

216
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 So many films, so many heroes in the film.

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 Of course, films have to kind of go up and down and there's valleys and before the final triumph.

218
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 How do they get to that final triumph?

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Often that hero discovers who they truly are.

220
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 You hear Simba hearing the voice booming from the heavens, "Remember who you are."

221
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 When we know our identity, that is when we are truly humble.

222
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 That's when we'll finally be on the road to becoming emotionally healthy.

223
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 So my question to all of us here, to my question to you at home.

224
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 When you are asked, "Who are you?" What do you say?

225
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 You see, in Hong Kong, HKID cards are very important.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And they're so important that if you found not having, carrying it, then of course you get punished.

227
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 But I think for us, as children of God, we've dropped our identity cards half the time.

228
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 We can't find where they are.

229
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Because I'll tell you who you really are.

230
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 You are a child of God.

231
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 You are a child of God.

232
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Now just pause for a second because you've heard that, you've sang it before.

233
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 And I want you to imagine, if that was the thing on your mind the most when you think about identity,

234
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 how would that, how should that impact the way you live?

235
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Those people that you're slightly intimidated by, those people you're slightly jealous of,

236
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 that person you're particularly angry at,

237
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 how does your identity as a child of God impact the way you think about them now?

238
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 That career move that you really want to make,

239
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 that car that you really want to buy,

240
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 that lifestyle that you really want to live.

241
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 If you truly recognise that you are not so and so, and a doctor, or an engineer, or whatever it may be,

242
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 if you are truly, I am so and so, I am a child of the most high God,

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 how does that impact the way you think?

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 How does that impact the way you live?

245
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 Because that has so much to do with whether you'll end up being emotionally healthy or being unhealthy.

246
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 So John the Baptist knows his own identity, and then he knows his own limits.

247
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Chapter 1, verse 26 says this.

248
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 So they ask him, "Hey, wait, you're not the Christ, you're not Elijah, you're not the prophet,

249
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 so what are you doing? Why are you baptising people?"

250
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 That's what they're asking him, and then verse 26 they say this,

251
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 "And John answered them, 'I baptise with water, but among you stands one you do not know.

252
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Even he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.'"

253
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 So not only does he know his own identity, he also knows his own limits.

254
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 He knows his own limits, and it's so important, if we're to be emotionally healthy, to know our own limits.

255
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 He knows who he is not.

256
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 How often do we know who we are not?

257
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 How often do we know what our own limits are?

258
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Yet society tells us to keep striving, keep chasing, keep going, because there's a better you in there.

259
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 And yet we find there's nothing.

260
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 But if we were to know our own limits, John says, "I baptise with water,

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 but there's going to be someone who's coming who's going to baptise you with the Spirit."

262
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Let me tell you about this guy.

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 This guy, I'm not even worthy to untie his sandals.

264
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Just let me tell you a little bit about that.

265
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Back then, disciples obviously would care for rabbis.

266
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 They'd give them drinks, they'd look after them, give them food, give them a jacket to wear if they're cold.

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 But there's one thing that they wouldn't do, would be to untie their sandals,

268
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 because that job was exclusive to slaves.

269
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 So then someone like John is saying, he's like, "I am not even worthy to be a slave for the next guy."

270
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 He knows his own limits. He's like, "I'm only dealing with water here.

271
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 The elements I'm dealing with are physical and from this realm,

272
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 but this guy is going to be baptising with the Spirit.

273
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And with him, I cannot even compare.

274
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I know my own limits."

275
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 And that water baptism is simply just a symbol for the baptism that is to come.

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 And so he's saying, "Look, you don't even know."

277
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Here's the problem. These people asking him questions,

278
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 they are still looking for the Messiah, but they're also trying to clamp down all the false messiahs.

279
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 Isn't it ironic that in the midst there, in their midst was the actual Messiah,

280
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 yet they couldn't see him. Why?

281
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Because they were prideful. Because they had a religious pride in them.

282
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 They were too busy puffing themselves up. They were blind.

283
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 And yet here's John the Baptist saying, "I know my own limits.

284
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 Look, I know who I am not. I'm not even pretending to be a big deal.

285
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Because there's a guy who's coming who I'm not even qualified to be his slave.

286
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 I can't even be his slave.

287
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 So don't come at me with this because there's going to be someone who's even bigger."

288
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 John the Baptist knows his own limits.

289
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 It's interesting here because Jesus himself says, Luke 7, he says,

290
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 "There's none greater than John the Baptist."

291
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 John the Baptist is the greatest. Jesus himself said that.

292
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And so if the greatest that Jesus said still knows his own limits,

293
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 still thinks he is nothing compared to Jesus, where does that leave us?

294
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 But do we truly know our own limits? Do we have that kind of pride?

295
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Because if we have that kind of pride, then we have to repent of it.

296
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 We have to let it go. Because we're nothing compared to even John the Baptist,

297
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 let alone Jesus. The road to emotional health starts with humility.

298
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 The road to humility starts with knowing your own identity, knowing your own limits,

299
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 knowing who you are not.

300
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And again, there's two types of people here I need to address this with

301
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 when it comes to this issue of knowing your own limits.

302
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 There's a group who you can't stop puffing yourselves up.

303
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 You can't stop pretending to be someone that you're not.

304
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 You can't stop saying, "Hey, look, I can do all these things.

305
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Look at me. I can do all these different things."

306
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 To you, it's let go. Know your own limits.

307
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 And if anything, these last few years around the world have reminded us

308
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 that we are all flawed. We all fall short of the glory of God.

309
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 Know your own limits. Know who you are not.

310
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 Be comfortable in saying, "I am not good at this.

311
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 I do not know what is going on. I am not okay."

312
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Stop puffing yourself up.

313
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 And to the second group, you're beating yourself up.

314
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And I want you to tell you to stop beating yourself up.

315
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 You are limited. You are flawed. You are mortal.

316
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And that's okay.

317
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 But your insecurity is actually a form of pride in itself.

318
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Your insecurity isn't humility.

319
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 Because it's showing that you don't know your own identity.

320
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 You don't know your own limits.

321
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 If you were truly aware and knew what your limits are,

322
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 you would recognise that, man, Jesus doesn't care about what you can do.

323
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 There isn't a ladder to climb up to Jesus.

324
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 There's nothing that you can jump for and grasp to get to Jesus.

325
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 The only way you get to Jesus is to know your own limits

326
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 and to open your hands out.

327
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Know your identity. Know your limits.

328
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 So how does John know his own limits?

329
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 How does he remind himself every day of this?

330
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Because we've all been there where there'll be days where we're like,

331
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 "You know what? I was too prideful at that moment. I was too insecure."

332
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 I remind myself of it.

333
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 But then it's still tiring to do it every day, right?

334
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 We always forget and we always end up back in the same place.

335
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 How did John do it?

336
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 How did John maintain that level of humility?

337
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 It's in a little bit later, and I don't think it's on the slides here.

338
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Verse 29, it says, "The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him

339
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 and he said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.'"

340
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 You see, I think this gives us a clue as to how John the Baptist remained humble.

341
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 His eyes were focused on Jesus.

342
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 When he walked into a place where he saw Jesus,

343
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 instead of saying, "Behold, I, John the Baptist,"

344
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God."

345
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 His eyes were constantly focused on Jesus.

346
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 See, the way we battle pride, the way we battle insecurity,

347
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 is genuinely to think of ourselves less.

348
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 Whichever way you're coming from,

349
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 is to know your own identity, to know your own limits,

350
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 and to let go and stop saying, "Behold, I, look at me,"

351
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 or, "Don't look at me."

352
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 No, let both of those sides go.

353
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Just behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world.

354
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 When we commit, devote to simply keeping our eyes turned to Jesus,

355
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 then we will be free from the pride.

356
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 Then we will be free from the insecurity.

357
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Then we will know our own identity.

358
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 Then we will know our own limits.

359
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 So whether you are puffing yourself up or beating yourself up,

360
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 the goal is to let go and to behold and look at Jesus.

361
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 So the first thing, know your own identity.

362
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 The second thing, know your own limits.

363
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 The final thing, know your purpose.

364
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 We see in chapter one again, verse 23, he says,

365
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 "I am the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,

366
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 "make straight the way of the Lord."

367
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 He roots his answer in scripture.

368
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Verse 31, he says, "I myself did not know him,

369
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 "but for this purpose I came, for this purpose I came,

370
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 "baptising with water that he might be revealed to Israel."

371
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 See, if we are to become emotionally healthy,

372
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 not only do we need to know who we are,

373
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 but not only do we need to know what our limits are,

374
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 we also need to know why we are here.

375
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 So that question that the Jews asked John,

376
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 "Who are you and what's your business here?"

377
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 That is the same question that the world is asking us.

378
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Who are you and what are you doing here?

379
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And so for us, we need to know the answer to that.

380
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 We need to know what we were called for.

381
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And John himself said, "I am the voice of the one crying out in the wilderness,

382
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 "making straight the way of the Lord."

383
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 You see, back then, ancient royalty, whenever they went to visit a town,

384
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 they would actually send someone ahead of them

385
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 to make straight the path, to basically get rid of any obstacles.

386
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 If there was a wild ox just blocking the path,

387
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 it was that person's job to get rid of it before the royalty comes.

388
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 And what John is saying here, "Hey, if this is what I'm here to do,

389
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 "Jesus is on his way, the Messiah is on his way.

390
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 "My job is to make sure his road is clear."

391
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 Where's the Messiah heading?

392
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 The Messiah is heading into our hearts.

393
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 It is heading into your heart, my heart.

394
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 What is John's role, as he sees here?

395
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 John is saying, "In order for the Messiah to head into your heart,

396
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 "I need to tell you about him and so you repent."

397
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 The preparation for this Messiah is repentance.

398
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 And he's saying, "I'm here just to prepare that

399
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 "so that Jesus can be the one that walks straight into your heart, not me."

400
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Jesus, "Not me, because I'm not even allowed to be his slave.

401
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 "I'm not even good enough to be his slave."

402
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 But it's Jesus.

403
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 And so for us, we also need to know our purpose.

404
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 How do we know our purpose?

405
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Isn't that the question of the day?

406
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 What am I here for?

407
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 I mean, one of the best-selling books, Christian books of all time,

408
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 is "Purpose Driven Life."

409
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 And so we're looking for that purpose, right?

410
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 We're looking, "Why, God, did you make me?"

411
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 But then maybe the question isn't a wrong question,

412
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 but maybe the angle that we're approaching it is wrong.

413
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 When we're looking to God and going, "Why did you make me?"

414
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 What are we really making it about?

415
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 We're actually still making it about us.

416
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 "Great Almighty God, King of the heavens, why did you make me?"

417
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 As if it's all about us.

418
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 But in order for us to truly know our purpose,

419
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 maybe we twist it around a little bit.

420
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 In order to find out what we are created for,

421
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 our goal may simply be to find out the Creator.

422
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 If a creation wants to find out what it's created for,

423
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 then know the Creator.

424
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And there only really is one purpose and one call.

425
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 Psalm 27 says this, "There's only one thing I'm after."

426
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 What's the one thing I'm after?

427
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 To dwell in God's presence.

428
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 To gaze upon His beauty, to inquire in His temple, to glorify Him.

429
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 That's the main calling.

430
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 It's almost the only calling.

431
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 All the other callings are simply expressions of that one.

432
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 To know Him and be known, to love Him and be loved.

433
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 And we need to stop making it about us.

434
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 We need to stop making it about,

435
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 "My purpose is still for me to find satisfaction."

436
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Even a righteous one that sounds spiritual and sound holy,

437
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 but it's still about me.

438
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 And I wonder whether there are any of us like that.

439
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 I search my heart as I'm asking God, "What do you want me to do?"

440
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 So often I realize, God just turning back to me,

441
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 "James, it's cute that you ask that, but it's not really about you.

442
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 It's about me.

443
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 It's about how big I am, not what you can do.

444
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 It's about what I've done, not what you're about to do.

445
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 But it's cute that you ask it."

446
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 But I wonder, even for those of us who are well-meaning,

447
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 are we committed to knowing the Creator Himself,

448
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 recognizing that He's the end goal, He's the destination,

449
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 rather than going to Him just to find out what we were made for?

450
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Sometimes we feel as though He's sitting on a desk somewhere

451
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 and we're just all queuing up, waiting to see Him,

452
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 just for Him to give us a piece of paper to tell us what we're supposed to do.

453
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 But no, that's not the purpose, that's not the goal.

454
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 The goal is simply to behold Him, to know who He is.

455
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 And in that, we will find our purpose.

456
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 So we need to know our own identity, we need to know our own limits,

457
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 and we need to know our purpose, the ultimate purpose

458
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 of being loved by Him and to love others.

459
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 That is the key here.

460
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 And that is how, really, an aspect of how we achieve humility.

461
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And I want to finish with this, and again, it's later on in Chapter 3,

462
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 there's another passage that, in these four verses,

463
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 it sums up everything about John in these four verses.

464
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 And I want to finish with that because it hammers home

465
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 all of the aspects that we've just been looking at.

466
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 In Chapter 3, verse 27, and actually just before that,

467
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 what's happening is John's disciples are having a discussion

468
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 with other people about a ritual, about purification,

469
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 and they're having a little argument.

470
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 And then they go to John, their rabbi, and say,

471
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 "Rabbi, you know that guy from the other day?"

472
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Brackets, Jesus, the Messiah, the Lamb of God.

473
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 "He's baptising a whole ton of people, and people are going to him.

474
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 Do you recognise that our stall is now getting quieter and quieter?

475
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 The forecast does not look good for our business.

476
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 It's not going the way that we want it to if we're trying to promote ourselves.

477
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 What do you want us to do?"

478
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 is basically what they're asking, because they still don't get it.

479
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 They've put their lives following John,

480
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 and they're hoping that this reaps success.

481
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Their investment will end up multiplying,

482
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 and they'll gain in at least significance.

483
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 What they're seeing is everyone's going over there, to that guy,

484
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 and he's not even wearing camel's hair.

485
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 And so they turn to him and ask him this question,

486
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 and what does he say?

487
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Verse 27, he replies, and he says,

488
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 "A person cannot receive even one thing unless it is given him from heaven."

489
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 And he's saying, "Do you not realise that everything I have,

490
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 everything that we're even doing here, comes from him?

491
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 That he's the main attraction here?

492
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 Do you not realise that?"

493
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 You see, when we realise that everything that we have comes from him,

494
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 then you know what that does?

495
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 That stops us from envying.

496
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 That stops us from being jealous, because we're like,

497
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 "Whoa, we had nothing to begin with, and yet God's given us this,

498
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 so we don't need to look anywhere else, let alone to the Saviour of the world."

499
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 John, again, knew who he was, and knew who he's not,

500
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 and knew what he was here for.

501
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 Do you not understand that everything we have is because of him?

502
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 The fact that you even have life, oxygen, a brain,

503
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 to be able to say these words to me, comes from him.

504
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 So humble yourself, let go.

505
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 It's not about us, it's about him.

506
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And then he carries on, he says, verse 28, he says,

507
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 "You yourselves bear witness that I said, 'I am not the Christ,'

508
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 but I've been sent before him."

509
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 He's like, "You were there when I said the other day

510
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 that I am not the Christ, so you shouldn't be following me

511
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 because you think I'm the Christ, or a prophet, or Elijah.

512
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 You know who I am, I'm simply a voice.

513
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 I'm not even allowed to assign myself a body,

514
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 I'm not even that important, I'm just a voice crying out in the wilderness,

515
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 'Make straight the way of the Lord.'"

516
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 Realise who I am, and who I am not.

517
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 No trace of envy, no trace of bitterness.

518
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 He's embraced a descent into being anonymous,

519
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 and he's completely okay with it.

520
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 This courageous, loud, brash guy is ready to be known by no one.

521
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 That is humility.

522
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 And then he carries on, verse 29,

523
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 "The one who has the bride is the bridegroom.

524
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 The friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him

525
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice.

526
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Therefore, this joy of mine is now complete."

527
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 He's saying, "Look, if it's a wedding,

528
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 I need you to know that I'm not the groom.

529
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 I am actually simply a friend of the groom.

530
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Maybe best man, I don't know, I don't care.

531
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 But I'm just a friend of the groom,

532
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 and filled with happiness looking at this."

533
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 A couple of months ago, I was at the honour and excitement

534
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 of witnessing my own brother's wedding.

535
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 And I remember the joy that I felt from, well,

536
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 actually seeing him get married,

537
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 because I never thought it would happen.

538
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 And then, you know what, I remember just standing there,

539
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 the pride I felt, the joy I felt,

540
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 of just looking at him going, "Oh, we've made it.

541
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 He's finally made it."

542
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 And I remember that joy.

543
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 I think back to my own wedding some 11 and a half years ago.

544
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 I remember him standing there,

545
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 and we had another friend standing there.

546
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 I remember the smile on their faces when I was getting married.

547
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 There's something about when it's not about you,

548
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 where you naturally smile.

549
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Whereas the wedding couple themselves,

550
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 sometimes they're just forced to smile for the whole day,

551
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 because they're supposed to.

552
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 But when it's not about you, you're always free,

553
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 and I'm just like, "Oh, that is so amazing that this is happening,

554
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 when it's not about you."

555
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 And actually, what's even more special about that wedding

556
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 a couple of months ago, was that it wasn't even about them.

557
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 And that was the joy that came from it,

558
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 was that it was about God.

559
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 The whole wedding was pointing to God.

560
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 It was two people in love, and actually often,

561
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 the name Bridezilla comes from somewhere,

562
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 and I won't say anymore,

563
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 is couples getting married make the wedding all about themselves.

564
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 And then it becomes a very stressful event for all those involved,

565
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 especially the pastors trying to help them.

566
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 And yet when you let go and just realise,

567
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
 "Oh my goodness, it's not even about me."

568
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 This wedding is simply just to reflect

569
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 the biggest wedding that is to come.

570
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 The details of this banquet are nothing compared

571
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 to what is going to be coming in the future.

572
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 Then suddenly that burden is lifted off your shoulders.

573
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 Suddenly, you're able to find that joy.

574
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 That joy that you can't find whilst being a narcissist.

575
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Because, see it's interesting,

576
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 the Kingdom of God is so subtle and so gentle and so gracious,

577
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 it's that it hides these things in plain sight.

578
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And you're only able to attain them,

579
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 only able to achieve them, when you let go.

580
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 When you realise it's not about you, it's about Him.

581
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 And that moment, John the Baptist realises,

582
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 and then he says, "As the friend of the bridegroom,

583
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 "the groom is now here, and I am rejoicing greatly,

584
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 "therefore this joy of mine is now complete."

585
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 Isn't that what we all want?

586
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 That we get to say, "Our joy is complete."

587
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 Isn't that it?

588
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 Isn't that what we're all searching for?

589
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 That true satisfaction from within.

590
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And being able to say, "It is complete."

591
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 Where did that joy start from for John the Baptist?

592
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 He started that when he was still in the womb.

593
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
 Remember when Mary goes to visit Elizabeth,

594
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 and then suddenly John jumps in the womb out of joy?

595
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
 So even from before he was born,

596
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 he knew his life, his identity, his limits,

597
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 his purpose was to point to the Messiah,

598
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 and finally the Messiah is now here.

599
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 And because of that, his joy is complete.

600
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 And the final words, "He must increase, I must decrease.

601
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 "He must become greater, I must become less."

602
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 When you realise who you are, when you realise who you're not,

603
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 you realise you can find true joy,

604
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 and at that moment you no longer have to strive for things

605
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 the way the people in this world do.

606
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 You can let go, and then you can find that true joy.

607
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 But that's a rare trait to have,

608
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 to genuinely be able to say, "He must increase, I must decrease."

609
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 If only us pastors, if only bankers, if only doctors,

610
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 if only all of us would commit to saying that together.

611
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 It's not about us, it's about Him.

612
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 There's going to come a day when Jesus returns.

613
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 Our job is to make straight the way of the Lord,

614
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 to lead people to Him, to show them how much they are loved,

615
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 to be His hands and feet, recognising the head is coming back.

616
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 And in that, we will find joy, and in that, they will find joy.

617
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 That impacts the way you live, if you truly understand that.

618
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 Instead of walking into a setting, a gathering,

619
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 which we're doing less and less of these days,

620
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 and saying, "Behold, I, James, have arrived."

621
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Or instead of thinking, "Do I want to be here even at this?

622
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 "Do I even want to be here at this gathering?

623
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 "Do I even want to see these people?

624
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 "Do I even want to do this?"

625
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 The question then ends up flipping, once we get the right mindset.

626
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 It becomes, not whether I want to be here, is God here?

627
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 Because if God's here, then I want to be here.

628
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Because it's not about me, it's about Him.

629
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 And when we do that, when we find that true humility,

630
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 that is when we're on the road to being emotionally healthy.

631
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 When we do that as a body, together.

632
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
 Can you imagine all of us doing that?

633
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 Laying aside our own preferences for human beings,

634
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 laying aside our own preferences for friends,

635
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
 and for social gatherings, for jobs even,

636
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 for anything that we do in this world.

637
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 If all of us, as a body of Christ, all laid down and saying,

638
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 "It's not about us, it's about Him."

639
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Wouldn't that change the way of the world?

640
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 Wouldn't that turn the world upside down?

641
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 And isn't that what we are called to do?

642
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 How attractive would we be as a body of Christ?

643
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 How beautiful a bride would we be,

644
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 if we were all able to have that kind of mindset?

645
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 And that is what we commit to doing.

646
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Saying, being that body that cries out,

647
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:55,000
 "It's not about us, it's not about me, it's about Him."

648
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
 All of it is about Him.

649
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 From the beginning to the end, it's about Him.

650
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 May that be our heart's cry,

651
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 especially as we navigate these times in this city.

652
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 Let's pray.

653
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 So Lord, we thank you again for this reminder

654
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,000
 that it is all about you.

655
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 That everything that we have and everything that we are

656
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 all comes from you.

657
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 Lord, you are the cornerstone.

658
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
 We are simply just the earth's stones lying around,

659
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,000
 but we'll only find out who we are in reference to you.

660
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 So I pray, Lord.

661
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 I pray for the emotional health of our church.

662
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 I pray for the emotional health of each member of this church.

663
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
 Lord, that we would start on that road to being emotionally healthy

664
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 through humbling ourselves.

665
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
 Would you be gracious to us and let us understand what true humility is?

666
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 Would you show us where we dropped our identity cards?

667
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 Would you remind us who we are?

668
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 And then Lord, would you also remind us of our limits,

669
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 how we fall short?

670
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 But recognising that's okay,

671
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 because your power is made perfect in our weaknesses.

672
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 And Lord, then as we come face to face with you, our creator,

673
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 can you tell us what you have created us for?

674
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
 But not for our own fulfilment, not for our own satisfaction,

675
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 but for you, Lord.

676
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:05,000
 Everything, everything is about you.

677
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 You must become greater.

678
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 We must become less.

679
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 You must increase.

680
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
 We must decrease.

681
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 It's not about us.

682
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
 It's all about you.

683
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 We thank you that that is the truth that we can hold on to today.

684
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 In your name we pray.

685
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 Amen.

686
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,060
 you
