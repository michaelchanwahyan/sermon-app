1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
 (soft music)

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,840
 (soft music)

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,260
 (soft music)

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:18,420
 (upbeat music)

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,000
 (upbeat music)

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,580
 (upbeat music)

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:38,020
 (upbeat music)

8
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:49,980
 (upbeat music)

9
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,560
 (upbeat music)

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:01:10,680
 - Oh, even watching that bumper just totally fires me up.

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,900
 How are you today?

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,900
 KFC, what an absolute privilege and honor

13
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,660
 to be standing here on a stage in Kansas City

14
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,660
 in the United States and 12,500 plus kilometers away you are

15
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:31,020
 and we are together as one.

16
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,540
 I just think that is phenomenal.

17
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,480
 My name is Dan Diebel and seriously,

18
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,380
 I'm just pumped to be with you today

19
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,380
 and to be united around this one singular passion

20
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,760
 that you have and that we have.

21
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,860
 Basketball.

22
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,580
 Yeah, I've done a little research on you

23
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,500
 and I know that's one of your passions.

24
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,020
 We're going crazy right now.

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:58,180
 This is a series of time for us called March Madness

26
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,700
 where everyone is just watching basketball all day long

27
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,960
 and I've got this friend, his name is Ryan Hoover.

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,860
 We've been friends for over a decade now

29
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,100
 and Ryan was a standout basketball player

30
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,340
 at one of our premier universities here called Notre Dame

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,300
 and then he went on and played for 13 years

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,300
 in mostly in Italy and as he and I have been kind of,

33
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,980
 you know, talking throughout the years,

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,220
 he told me this story once.

35
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,940
 He said this, he said, "What was really odd

36
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,860
 "and sometimes challenging playing in Italy,

37
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,380
 "one is nobody quite knew how to pronounce his name."

38
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,820
 They didn't quite have a frame of reference for Ryan.

39
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,340
 The only frame of reference they had

40
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,220
 was the movie "Saving Private Ryan"

41
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,100
 which was translated in Italian as "Il Soldato."

42
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,840
 So that's what they called him.

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,340
 They called him Il Soldato for his kind of sweet J

44
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,940
 and his fiery tenacious spirit

45
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,620
 and that's what we've started to call them too, Il Soldato.

46
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,980
 But here's what he said.

47
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,060
 He said, "Playing in Italy, particularly in this one league

48
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,060
 "in this one town, the media after every single game

49
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,280
 "would score him on their own scorecard.

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,260
 "They would give him a grade on various kind of things

51
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,500
 "and then they'd publish it in the paper the next day."

52
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,300
 And here, I want you to just see,

53
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,980
 here's an actual scorecard for the team

54
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,060
 that he was playing on and if you can see at the very bottom

55
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,220
 is my friend Il Soldato, Ryan Hoover.

56
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,820
 If you look at the top, top right-hand corner,

57
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,820
 the guy there, Buzzi Thornton, he got a score of 41.

58
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,060
 That's pretty high.

59
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,060
 And my friend Ryan Hoover, Il Soldato, got only a four.

60
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,880
 Now what the media didn't know

61
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,440
 was that he had a defensive assignment that night.

62
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,320
 He was supposed to shut down their top scorer

63
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,760
 but they didn't know that.

64
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,440
 They're just scoring against their scorecard,

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,520
 giving him a four when actually in the locker room,

66
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,260
 the coach is probably giving him

67
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,880
 something higher than Buzzi.

68
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,420
 Do you see the challenge of what's going on here?

69
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,160
 Number one, as Ryan told me, he goes,

70
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,720
 "Look, like the media really had never played

71
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,960
 "much basketball, at least professionally."

72
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,300
 So that's a problem, right?

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,380
 To give a scorecard as if you're the judge and jury

74
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,800
 when you'd never actually played.

75
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,240
 But secondly, the media wasn't in the locker room

76
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
 to know what the assignments were,

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,880
 to know what the game plan was,

78
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,860
 to know what the scorecard of the coach was.

79
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,440
 So just imagine the tension

80
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,000
 that that would create among the team.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,940
 Am I going to play for myself

82
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,560
 to get the media scorecard grade,

83
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,680
 which is gonna be published

84
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,200
 to receive the public kind of affection and approval?

85
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,040
 Or am I gonna seek to please my coach and his scorecard?

86
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,040
 And am I gonna be a team player

87
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,540
 and go after what is really winning?

88
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,360
 Does that sound familiar to you?

89
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,560
 Do you feel actually as a human being,

90
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,000
 and perhaps as, or most particularly as a Jesus follower,

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,440
 the tension of asking this question,

92
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,320
 what scorecard am I really using in my life?

93
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,080
 'Cause the fact of the matter is,

94
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,760
 you and I, at birth, we are handed a scorecard in life.

95
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,520
 And we're rated by the world,

96
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,400
 we're rated on where you live,

97
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,900
 what kind of job you have,

98
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,760
 the kind of possessions you own,

99
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,340
 the size of the diamond on your finger,

100
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,920
 the things that you have the freedom to do.

101
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,760
 Basically, no matter what continent you're on,

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,980
 every culture has kind of different status symbols,

103
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,880
 different kind of rating systems,

104
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,120
 but it always seems to come down to possessions,

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,640
 to maybe your investments portfolio,

106
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,320
 it might come down to your resources, your connections,

107
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,480
 and we are scored every single day.

108
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,000
 And if we're honest about it,

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 it can drive us crazy inside.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,720
 The constant comparing, the wondering if I'm failing,

111
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,280
 the wondering if I'm measuring up,

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,520
 am I getting far enough in life?

113
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,440
 I mean, it can just wreak havoc in your mind

114
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,440
 if we rate ourselves according to the scorecard of the world

115
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,740
 and here's what I love.

116
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,680
 What I love about being a Jesus follower,

117
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,920
 and every time I open the scriptures

118
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,200
 and every time I listen to the Holy Spirit,

119
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,240
 you know what I hear?

120
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,080
 I hear our Father in Heaven saying,

121
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,960
 I keep a different score.

122
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
 I keep a different score.

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
 So we're in this series called the One Campaign,

124
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,080
 sharing in it together, and what we're really doing

125
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,100
 is we're looking at the life of Jesus

126
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,520
 through the Gospel of Mark,

127
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,900
 and we're looking at all these different moments

128
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,120
 and encounters where he just flips everything upside down.

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,800
 He basically says to his disciples over and over,

130
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,280
 give me your scorecard, come here, give it to me, all right.

131
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,200
 And he just rips it to shreds and says,

132
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,560
 now, let me give you the new game plan.

133
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,040
 Let me give you your new assignment.

134
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,400
 Let me give you your new scorecard.

135
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,040
 So here's what I wanna do.

136
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,240
 I want us to kind of go through the section of Mark

137
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,280
 that we're all in together,

138
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,400
 and I want us just to look at how Jesus

139
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,520
 begins to give a new scorecard to his disciples.

140
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,880
 And it takes a little time for them

141
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,500
 to kind of like figure it out,

142
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,840
 but we're gonna look at seven different moments,

143
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,220
 and we're gonna actually compare and contrast

144
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,600
 via whiteboard here the scorecard of the world

145
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,840
 with the scorecard of Jesus.

146
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,760
 And it starts in Mark chapter nine,

147
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,400
 so go ahead, grab your Bibles if you have 'em.

148
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,800
 Otherwise, we'll have 'em here right on the screen for you.

149
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
 But right, in Mark chapter nine, here's what's going on.

150
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,960
 The disciples are having an argument, all right?

151
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,720
 And they're jockeying for power.

152
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,600
 This is probably a succession moment.

153
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,000
 Jesus just described that he's not gonna be around forever,

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,880
 and then it's all of a sudden, hmm,

155
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,400
 well, who will be in charge then?

156
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,280
 And so here we come in verse 33, chapter nine.

157
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,320
 They came to Capernaum.

158
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,580
 When he was in the house, he asked them,

159
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,480
 what were you arguing about on the road?

160
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,600
 But they kept quiet.

161
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,360
 I love this, because on the way,

162
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,920
 they had argued about who was the greatest.

163
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,360
 Sitting down, which is a sign of,

164
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,440
 this is the coach coming out onto the court,

165
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,160
 bringing his stool, and everyone huddles up,

166
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,440
 huddle up, all right?

167
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,000
 Sitting down, Jesus called the 12 and said this.

168
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,840
 Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last

169
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,400
 and the servant of all.

170
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,380
 We're building the scorecard, right?

171
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,480
 The scorecard, the scorecard of the world, right?

172
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,600
 And by the way, we love the world.

173
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,840
 God loves the world, but it's just we contrast

174
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,880
 the systems, the ethos, the values of the world

175
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,520
 compared to the scorecard of Jesus.

176
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,440
 What do we say?

177
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,080
 Well, we see that according to the ways of the world,

178
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,480
 winning comes by being first.

179
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,200
 And Jesus goes, uh-uh, uh-uh.

180
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,800
 Winning comes through being last.

181
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,960
 Now, I don't know about you in Hong Kong,

182
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,400
 but I can tell you for us in America, this is really hard.

183
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,160
 This grates against our individualistic, right,

184
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,080
 just go for it spirit.

185
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,040
 What's Jesus saying here?

186
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,480
 He's going, this is the path of self-absorption.

187
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,000
 Now I'm calling you to not be about yourselves,

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,800
 but to give yourself away.

189
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,040
 That's what he's saying.

190
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,800
 Scorecard item number one, winning comes,

191
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,360
 Jesus says, through being last.

192
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,640
 Let's look at another moment.

193
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,160
 Let's just move to verse 38.

194
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,840
 Now, John and the other disciples,

195
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,960
 they see something going down and they don't like it.

196
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,880
 They go to Jesus, teacher, we saw someone

197
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,720
 driving out demons in your name.

198
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,440
 And we told them to stop because, and get this,

199
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,280
 he was not one of us.

200
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,880
 Oh man, there are places in our life and in our world

201
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,480
 to have really strong convictions,

202
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,600
 to say, here's just because of,

203
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,200
 I'm trying to be grounded in the scriptures,

204
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,280
 and I go, I can't join you in this,

205
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,560
 but there's also this danger of us versus them, right?

206
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,000
 And that's what's going on.

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,520
 And so what does Jesus do?

208
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,600
 He says, don't stop 'em, right?

209
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
 And then he goes on, verse 40,

210
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,200
 for whoever is not against us is for us.

211
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,640
 I can just guarantee, this is not what the disciples,

212
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:52,120
 they've just been handed this whole scorecard,

213
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,320
 all their life, right?

214
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,960
 Which says, you win by competition.

215
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,600
 And I might add division, right?

216
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,440
 Dividing us versus them.

217
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,240
 And Jesus is like, no, actually,

218
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,780
 if they're not against you, they're for you.

219
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,780
 You win by commonality, commonality, right?

220
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,160
 Let's meet people where they are.

221
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,240
 And where they're doing good stuff,

222
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,400
 let's not constantly just divide and sequester,

223
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,240
 let's join 'em.

224
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,280
 Where the king was breaking in, let's join 'em.

225
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,560
 It's beautiful.

226
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,520
 Jesus is just already ripping

227
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,760
 their old scorecard to shreds.

228
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,600
 Why?

229
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,280
 Because he says, I keep a different score than you,

230
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,920
 and the ways of the world.

231
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,160
 Let's jump to a third movement.

232
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,440
 This gets really dicey, because at that time,

233
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,800
 even still like today, there's all these cultural issues,

234
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,280
 and this one is about divorce.

235
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,200
 And there was a big kind of debate

236
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,040
 between two different rabbinical lines of thought.

237
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,160
 One is that it was pretty hard to divorce your wife,

238
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,880
 and the other is, it's really easy to divorce your wife.

239
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,720
 Why?

240
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,280
 Because if you go back, Moses gave us

241
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,720
 this certificate of dismissal,

242
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,520
 and so we should be able to divorce our wives

243
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,740
 for about anything.

244
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,600
 So they bring this question to Jesus.

245
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,800
 And I love what he does.

246
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,640
 He does this, I mean, he just does this

247
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,440
 like beautiful coach move.

248
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,760
 He doesn't really answer their question.

249
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,120
 He goes beyond their question

250
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,160
 to the origin of design and creation.

251
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,880
 Look with me, verse six, chapter 10.

252
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,320
 But at the beginning of creation,

253
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,520
 God made them male and female,

254
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,520
 and he goes on to just ground marriage

255
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,760
 in God's deep heart.

256
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,640
 And so there's this cultural scorecard, right,

257
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,640
 that says, well, marriage can end in dismissal.

258
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,840
 And Jesus flips it all around and says,

259
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,560
 marriage begins in dignity.

260
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,680
 And I'm just gonna share, I'm having cognitive dissonance

261
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,280
 whether I've, oh, dismiss, dismissal,

262
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,520
 that dismal, dismiss, ah, I know what I did wrong.

263
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,600
 Dismiss, oh, and I still don't know

264
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,760
 if I'm spelling that right.

265
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,960
 Having major issues right now in my brain.

266
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,760
 Oh, but for the grace of God, go I.

267
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,360
 Do you see what Jesus is doing here, though?

268
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,000
 He is absolutely ripping up the scorecard,

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,740
 saying, I keep a different score, let's keep going.

270
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,980
 People were bringing little children to Jesus

271
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,760
 for him to place his hands on, right?

272
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,980
 But the disciples rebuked them.

273
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,680
 They're like, man, kids, until they can be

274
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,040
 like working on the farm or working in the kitchen,

275
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,560
 until they can be productive,

276
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,000
 they really have no sense of value to us,

277
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,240
 so don't hassle the rabbi with the kids.

278
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,200
 And Jesus rebukes them, and he says,

279
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,400
 let the little children come to me,

280
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,560
 and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God

281
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,760
 belongs to such as these.

282
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,900
 What is Jesus saying?

283
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,040
 He says, I keep a different score.

284
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,520
 How does status and access come?

285
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,520
 Well, the world would say it comes through hierarchy, right?

286
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,840
 What does Jesus say?

287
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,900
 Status and access to all these important things

288
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,900
 comes through humility, humility.

289
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,600
 Let's keep going, let's keep going.

290
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,660
 The next one, this rich, this guy who's got tons of doubt,

291
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,920
 he comes up to Jesus, but you can tell

292
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,220
 he's got rattle in his soul.

293
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,280
 He's got all these things,

294
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,540
 but something feels really unsettled for him,

295
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,540
 and he's hoping to assuage that vacuous thing

296
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,140
 that he's feeling in his spirit.

297
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,380
 So he comes to Jesus very respectfully,

298
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,180
 falls to his knees, and says,

299
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,380
 what must I do to inherit eternal life?

300
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,180
 And they have this interesting conversation

301
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,860
 about, well, have you fulfilled the 10 commandments?

302
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,660
 He said, yes, since birth, since I was a little kid,

303
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,780
 I've done all these things,

304
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,780
 and that's when Jesus looks at him, and I love this,

305
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,420
 and loved him, one thing you lack, he said.

306
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,860
 Go sell everything you have and give to the poor.

307
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,260
 He goes on to say, and you will have treasure in heaven.

308
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,780
 Jesus is gonna look, I keep a different score.

309
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,300
 You could have all the riches in the world

310
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,740
 and be impoverished, or you can empty yourself

311
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,380
 on behalf of the poor and be rich.

312
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,860
 And what is he saying in this moment?

313
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,020
 The goal, according to the world, is prosperity.

314
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:58,180
 But the goal, according to the kingdom of God

315
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,520
 and the heart of the Father, is generosity.

316
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,500
 Let's keep moving.

317
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,340
 This is just so good.

318
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,060
 I mean, the contrast is just so thick.

319
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,740
 The sixth movement.

320
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,180
 Now, there's another argument by the disciples.

321
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,500
 Surprise, surprise.

322
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,060
 We all have, we can be really,

323
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,200
 what we say here in America, dense sometimes.

324
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,260
 It takes us a while to really reorient ourselves.

325
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,140
 So there's another argument, right?

326
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,880
 There's two brothers, James and John.

327
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,940
 They wanna sit at the right hand and the left hand of Jesus.

328
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,460
 When he enters into their kingdom, they pull him aside.

329
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,100
 They have this private conversation

330
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,380
 in a different gospel.

331
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,420
 They actually invoke their mom to do their bidding.

332
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,380
 It's really a mess.

333
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,420
 And the other 10 hear about it.

334
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,340
 And they get really upset, indignant, the scriptures say.

335
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,540
 And that's when Jesus calls another timeout,

336
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,700
 timeout, timeout, grabs a stool, brings it on the court.

337
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,660
 Everyone has to huddle up here.

338
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,820
 And then he says, "You know that those who are regarded

339
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,420
 "as rulers of the Gentiles, lord it over them.

340
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,340
 "And their high officials exercise authority over them.

341
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,400
 "Not so with you.

342
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
 "Instead, whoever wants to become great among you

343
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,780
 "must be your servant.

344
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,480
 "And whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.

345
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,100
 "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served,

346
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,100
 "but to serve and to give his life as ransom for many."

347
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,320
 And Jesus says, look, we lead, not positionally.

348
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,160
 With our titles and our thrones and our corner offices,

349
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,860
 we lead sacrificially, he says.

350
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,580
 We give ourselves away.

351
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,840
 The last moment we might be familiar with

352
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,040
 because we saw it in the opening sermon

353
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,680
 of this entire series.

354
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,320
 They're entering into Jericho.

355
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,280
 There's a loud buzz because Jesus is there.

356
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,760
 There's a blind man who's the son of Timaeus.

357
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,280
 His name is Bartimaeus.

358
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,280
 And he's sitting by the road and he hears the buzz

359
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,280
 and he starts crying out 'cause he hears that it's because

360
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,080
 of this rabbi named Jesus who has the power to heal.

361
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,560
 And he just starts crying out,

362
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,620
 Son of David, have mercy on me.

363
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,560
 Son of David, have mercy on me.

364
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,920
 And everyone starts telling him,

365
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,160
 be quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

366
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,060
 We would say here in America, shut up, shut up, shut up.

367
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,680
 And they're pushing him away.

368
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,380
 And Jesus says, bring him to me.

369
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,880
 And then the disciples go to him and say this powerful,

370
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,800
 three little words, it's just so beautiful.

371
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,800
 It's actually framed our entire one campaign series together.

372
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,640
 Cheer up, on your feet, he's calling you.

373
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,800
 And this man gets healed.

374
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,320
 Jesus says, what do you want me to do for you?

375
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,960
 He says, I wanna receive sight.

376
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,760
 And he's healed in that moment.

377
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,660
 But think about that moment.

378
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,840
 This man is so desperate.

379
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,440
 He's off to the side.

380
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,120
 He's probably just inhaling the dust that's being kicked up

381
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,180
 from all the feet that are just trampling

382
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,040
 to jockey themselves to Jesus by access, by power,

383
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,320
 by all these things.

384
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,000
 And he's just crying out and he refuses to stop.

385
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,760
 And Jesus, just like he saw the rich young ruler,

386
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,420
 he hears this man.

387
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,000
 And what do we learn about this?

388
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,600
 In this very moment, we learn that in the world scorecard,

389
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,660
 some people are expendable.

390
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:40,280
 But in the scorecard of Jesus,

391
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,320
 here's a word we've been using a lot.

392
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,200
 Everyone is essential.

393
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,040
 Born with the image of God, made with the dignity of God.

394
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,600
 Now I want you just to look for a moment at this list.

395
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,120
 The world says it's gotta be about you.

396
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,180
 You gotta be on top.

397
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,360
 It's about dividing and conquering through competition.

398
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,680
 It's about dismissing others in marriage

399
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,340
 or any other relationship.

400
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,520
 It's about hierarchy.

401
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,480
 Where are you in the pecking order

402
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,260
 and on the rungs of the ladder?

403
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,360
 It's about prosperity, right?

404
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,540
 Just gain, gain more, right?

405
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,960
 As if you think it's gonna fill yourself up.

406
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,080
 It's about positional power

407
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,880
 and it's about seeing other people

408
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,780
 through a value rubric of some are more valuable

409
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,700
 all the way to others are expendable.

410
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,680
 This is the scorecard that you and I,

411
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,720
 that we're handed every single day in our lives.

412
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,960
 And we have a decision to make.

413
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,760
 Are we gonna live by that scorecard?

414
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,260
 And I bet if you thought through your work life,

415
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,000
 if you thought through your government system,

416
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,480
 like we do here,

417
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,680
 basically pick your sector, pick your industry,

418
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,320
 pick your habitat, pick even in your home.

419
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,040
 And frankly, it's very sad,

420
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,480
 but we can even see this played out in the church, can't we?

421
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,600
 And where does this lead?

422
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,320
 Where's the scorecard lead?

423
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,900
 On a playground, it leads to bullying.

424
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,900
 In a boardroom, politicking, power plays.

425
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,740
 Geopolitically, war.

426
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,580
 Socially, injustice.

427
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:40,380
 If left to its own devices, to its furthest extreme,

428
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,420
 genocide.

429
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,920
 Because the scorecard is based on power.

430
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:58,340
 Richard Foster, the great Quaker writer in his book

431
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,860
 that was at least once titled Money, Sex, and Power

432
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,820
 writes this about power.

433
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,740
 He says this.

434
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:11,160
 "Power can destroy or it can create.

435
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,140
 "The power that destroys demands ascendancy,

436
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,100
 "it demands total control.

437
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,340
 "It destroys relationships, it destroys trust,

438
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,020
 "it destroys dialogue, it destroys integrity.

439
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:26,420
 "And this is true whether you look through the macrocosm

440
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,520
 "of human history or the microcosm

441
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,300
 "of our own personal histories of you and me,

442
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,140
 "and even what happens in a marriage,

443
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,380
 "and even what happens between siblings,

444
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,260
 "and even what happens in a home or in a heart."

445
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,100
 What scorecard are you using for your life?

446
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:53,300
 Because I look at the scorecard of Jesus,

447
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,180
 and would you look with me here?

448
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,260
 It's like, would you like to live in a world

449
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,740
 where everyone says, how can I give myself away

450
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,860
 to the service of others today?

451
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,300
 Would you like to live in a world where everyone says,

452
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,300
 hey, if they're not against you, then let 'em be for you.

453
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,780
 Like, let's seek out commonality with conviction.

454
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,820
 Would you like to live in a world where everyone

455
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,740
 was just seen as a baseline of dignity,

456
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,260
 and if every marriage stayed that way and lived that way?

457
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,780
 Would you love to live in a world

458
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,620
 where in the corporate space, there was a sense of humility

459
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,040
 versus what we describe as the smartest guys in the room?

460
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,640
 Would you like to live in a world

461
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,920
 where people weren't just trying

462
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,900
 to accumulate wealth for themselves,

463
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,140
 but they felt this sense of beautiful responsibility

464
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,880
 to give what they have away to others, a generous world?

465
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,540
 Would you like to live in a world

466
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,720
 where leaders lead sacrificially,

467
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,100
 and they don't lord it over you?

468
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,820
 They go, how do I serve, how do I give myself away?

469
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,100
 Would you like to live in a world

470
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,700
 where everyone is essential?

471
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,980
 I do, and that's the invitation of Jesus for you and for me.

472
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,740
 When he rips up your old scorecard, he says,

473
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,740
 here, take this, and as we live this way,

474
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,180
 what happens as the spirit of God

475
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,100
 who forms and shapes this in you and me,

476
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,020
 well, what happens?

477
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,900
 Well, there's more love, the Bible says.

478
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,980
 There's more joy, there's more peace.

479
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,700
 There's greater patience, there's self-control,

480
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,780
 there's gentleness, forbearance.

481
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,420
 All the beautiful things that exist in heaven

482
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,340
 all the time today break into your life and my life,

483
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,500
 and if we look over,

484
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,180
 history, human history, particularly the last 2,000 years,

485
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,900
 and say, who's led this way?

486
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,020
 Who's led this way?

487
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,940
 The early church led this way.

488
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,660
 They'd go through trash heaps to find babies

489
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,860
 that had been abandoned,

490
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,300
 and they'd bring them, nurse them back to life,

491
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,040
 and take them in as their own.

492
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,980
 They were advocates for the outcasts,

493
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,820
 for the disenfranchised, the women, poor.

494
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,500
 They broke through hierarchy and status,

495
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:07,780
 hierarchy and status and layers to care.

496
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:12,060
 More modern examples as we go throughout history,

497
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,980
 Father Damien, who literally went to the lepers

498
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,420
 and brought the love of Jesus.

499
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,160
 Hudson Taylor, who brought the love of Christ to Asia.

500
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,940
 Jackie Pollinger, who with $10 in her pocket

501
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,380
 arrived in the walled city in Hong Kong

502
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,740
 to care for opium addicts.

503
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,660
 Martin Luther King, who all the pressure

504
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,780
 was to just like fight, fight, fight,

505
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,460
 and he's like, no, nonviolence,

506
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,220
 and bring the love of Jesus.

507
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,760
 Nelson Mandela, after years and years of apartheid,

508
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,740
 when everyone's crying for revenge,

509
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,860
 says, no, we're gonna seek reconciliation.

510
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,660
 William Wilberforce leveraged his status

511
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,140
 and his power to see the abolishment of slavery.

512
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:03,140
 Mother Teresa in the slums of Calcutta,

513
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,300
 saying, Jesus, how can I bring your scorecard

514
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,300
 to the expendable, to those who have been dismissed?

515
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:18,840
 Dave, a business partner here in Kansas City,

516
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,620
 a business friend of mine, who has a lot of money,

517
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,480
 a lot of status, and a lot of employees,

518
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,060
 and he says to them, let me be your assistant.

519
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,880
 What do you need?

520
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,940
 I wanna serve you.

521
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,420
 April, who came alongside quietly,

522
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,940
 without telling anyone, she's a mom,

523
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,620
 she lives in a very nice part of town here in Kansas City,

524
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,840
 but there was a man in our church named Steve

525
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,420
 who's confined to a wheelchair,

526
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,140
 can barely even lift himself up with his arms,

527
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,620
 can barely even shower, take care of himself,

528
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,540
 and lives alone.

529
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,540
 And so every other week, she just quietly goes across town

530
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,580
 to his apartment, cleans it, cooks me a meal,

531
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,460
 cooks meals, helps him with the things that he needs.

532
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,580
 See, that's winning.

533
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,360
 That's living by a different scorecard.

534
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,860
 I just wanna ask you, I just wanna say this.

535
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:19,360
 What from this scorecard of the world

536
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,960
 do you just need to see eradicated from your life?

537
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,220
 And I'll share with you for me right now.

538
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,840
 I have the privilege of being

539
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,520
 one of the teaching pastors here,

540
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,520
 but I also have started a business in the last year.

541
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,720
 And I'm being challenged right here.

542
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,040
 I'm being challenged, but okay,

543
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,220
 what scorecard am I gonna live by?

544
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,920
 What is the challenge for you?

545
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,080
 And conversely, what do you want to experience more of

546
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,800
 from the scorecard of Jesus?

547
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,080
 And we would just simply say, Holy Spirit,

548
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,320
 whatever that is, Holy Spirit,

549
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,760
 would you gift me with more of your humility?

550
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,520
 Would you gift me with more of the ability

551
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,960
 to see commonality?

552
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,920
 Jesus, would you gift me with a generous spirit

553
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
 by your spirit?

554
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,920
 Whatever that is, we just simply ask him for it.

555
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:21,880
 And maybe, maybe you're going,

556
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,000
 maybe you're going, aren't we skipping a step?

557
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,400
 Maybe you thought that this was the only scorecard

558
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,160
 available to you in your life.

559
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:39,280
 You didn't even know this whole other world

560
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,640
 and opportunity exists.

561
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,840
 You didn't know that Jesus actually wants to be your coach.

562
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,080
 And if that's the case,

563
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,960
 and if when we describe this kind of world,

564
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,520
 and then I asked you, would you like to live in that world?

565
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,920
 Would you like to experience those things?

566
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,320
 Would you like to have this true in your home,

567
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
 in your marriage, at your place of work?

568
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,480
 And if something rose up in you,

569
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,480
 then I would just tell you this,

570
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,200
 it's time to change teams.

571
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,520
 It's time to have a new coach.

572
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,160
 His name is Jesus.

573
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,120
 And he looks at you and he goes, you're not a four.

574
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,560
 Like on every single mark, he goes, because of me,

575
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,560
 my life, my death, my resurrection, you're a 10.

576
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,440
 You're a 10.

577
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,840
 That's my scorecard for you.

578
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,120
 I've already pre-scored you at the cross.

579
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,840
 And man, there's so much beauty there.

580
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,840
 So much freedom there.

581
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:36,880
 And actually, I want you to hear from my friend Ryan Hoover,

582
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,760
 who also lives here in Kansas City.

583
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,040
 We get to hang out in our small group.

584
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,920
 We call it an A2 community.

585
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,840
 We meet every Wednesday morning for prayer together.

586
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,720
 And graciously, he's decided to join me.

587
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,080
 So I wanna bring out Il Soldato.

588
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,080
 So KFCI, would you please just give him a warm welcome?

589
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:05,360
 Well, Ryan Hoover, thank you so much

590
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,000
 for joining us here today.

591
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,840
 - Yeah, Dave.

592
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,760
 - Yeah.

593
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,200
 Well, so man, there's so much we could talk about,

594
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,600
 but what I haven't yet shared

595
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,680
 is that right before you switched your scorecard,

596
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,240
 you went to Hong Kong to play in an All-Star game.

597
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,400
 And just for fun,

598
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,760
 what was the level of talent out there in Hong Kong?

599
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,400
 - Well, I don't really remember much

600
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,680
 about what led up to that time,

601
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,120
 but I think in my mind,

602
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,480
 I thought America was the best in basketball,

603
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,360
 which I think we are,

604
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,360
 but I was really surprised by the level of talent

605
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,600
 and the competition that we faced when we got to Hong Kong.

606
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,800
 - So you kind of just lackadaisically entered the court

607
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,640
 and all of a sudden you're like,

608
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,360
 "Oh, I better bring my A game."

609
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,600
 - Yeah, exactly.

610
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,600
 - Well, what's also interesting to me about that time,

611
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,200
 this is 1997, it's the summer of 1997,

612
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,480
 and it was just months before

613
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,740
 you ripped up your old scorecard

614
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,080
 and you took the scorecard of Jesus.

615
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,520
 You gave your life to Jesus.

616
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,040
 Describe that moment,

617
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,520
 and maybe even what was leading up to that for you?

618
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,400
 Like the time of living by this old world scorecard,

619
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,440
 what was that like?

620
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,980
 - Yeah, I think just growing up,

621
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,840
 I had the dream and I had goals that I was going after

622
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,720
 in terms of getting a college scholarship

623
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,040
 and playing basketball.

624
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,080
 It was based around that,

625
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,160
 and it was about just being the best at what I was,

626
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:32,680
 and I was obsessed with being the best shooter in the world,

627
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,840
 and every day I approached it like that,

628
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,400
 but it was about me,

629
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,000
 and it was about me reaching my goals,

630
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,720
 and that's really all I cared about.

631
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,160
 I didn't really have an awareness of what else was there,

632
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,560
 so I kind of just went in with every opportunity

633
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,080
 just going after it like that.

634
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,760
 - And for all of us in our lives,

635
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,840
 whether it's basketball or business

636
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,880
 or whatever our pursuits,

637
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,560
 at some point we kind of come to,

638
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,600
 we get in touch with that emptiness maybe,

639
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,120
 or we come up against to the limit of ourselves,

640
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,940
 and we don't quite have the answers

641
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,800
 that we thought that we did,

642
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,680
 and we go, "Is there something more?

643
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,520
 "Am I missing something?"

644
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,840
 Did that happen for you?

645
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,480
 - Yeah, interestingly enough,

646
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:21,940
 that's how God grew me and drew me to himself,

647
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,520
 was through the game of basketball.

648
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,680
 So what had become my God and my idol,

649
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,560
 he used it to draw me to himself,

650
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,120
 and then I experienced him in a real way,

651
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,240
 and his authority and his availability

652
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,220
 became an experience for me,

653
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,020
 not that I heard stories about other people

654
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,340
 or that I read in the book or the Bible

655
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,940
 that I was taught, but it became real to me,

656
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,300
 and it was interesting that it was

657
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,320
 through the game of basketball,

658
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,820
 and it was around the time that I was in Hong Kong.

659
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,620
 - Well, and you grew up in a church,

660
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,500
 so you knew Bible stories and things like that,

661
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,220
 but you were invited into something more,

662
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,740
 and can you describe that?

663
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,080
 I know you were with a group called Athletes in Action,

664
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,820
 which was kind of a professional ministry

665
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,260
 of professional basketball players who loved Jesus,

666
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,700
 and it was actually, you said yes,

667
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,740
 but not even quite knowing what you were signing up for

668
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,940
 at the time, right?

669
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,300
 - Yeah, I just wanted to play basketball.

670
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,860
 It was another opportunity for me

671
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:23,340
 to play against good competition and hone my skills.

672
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,460
 So yeah, it was just interesting how God used

673
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,540
 that opportunity with Athletes in Action.

674
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,660
 I went to Shanghai a couple months later

675
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,620
 after my experience in Hong Kong,

676
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,580
 so I got another Asian experience,

677
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,060
 and it was another one that kind of helped me to grow,

678
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,260
 not only on the court, but off the court,

679
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,260
 and then I joined a tour with Athletes in Action

680
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,300
 back in the US where we played the college teams,

681
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,540
 and that was when I came to the Lord,

682
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,500
 and I was with a group that helped me process

683
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,660
 what I was going through as I was still going after my goals.

684
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,820
 I was still going after my dreams,

685
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,500
 but now in a new way with a new scorecard.

686
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,860
 - Yeah, I love it, 'cause you were in between contracts.

687
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:08,920
 Sure, I'll go play, and if we talk about Jesus

688
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,180
 with folks during halftime, that's fine, right?

689
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,580
 But then it was the relationships of the guys on this team

690
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,020
 that just started asking you questions

691
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,060
 you couldn't quite answer, right?

692
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,820
 - Yeah, and I just, I had to ask myself the hard questions,

693
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,660
 and then finally I just went to the Lord,

694
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,420
 and I said, "What's going on?"

695
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,820
 And I wrote a letter and everything,

696
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,620
 and I experienced Him in a real way,

697
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,900
 and my path took a whole new route after that,

698
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,660
 and as you talk about the scorecard, it was the same thing.

699
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,020
 A lot of these things on this side started popping up,

700
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,560
 and I became aware of my selfishness and my pride

701
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,020
 and my, a little bit of arrogance, you know,

702
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:52,020
 that started to shift, and it's still shifting.

703
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,940
 - Yes. - Still in my life today.

704
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,740
 You know, as I transitioned out of basketball

705
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,140
 into the business world, I still deal with these things,

706
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,560
 you know, in terms of that, and God continues

707
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,380
 to make me aware of my weaknesses

708
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,980
 and His power through my weakness,

709
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:14,980
 and so, yeah, it's a consistent work in progress,

710
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,460
 you know, it's ongoing.

711
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,900
 - Well, and what I love now is that you're giving

712
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,740
 your life to others, and yes,

713
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,580
 this is why we need the Holy Spirit, right,

714
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,940
 just to say, would you continue to purge

715
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,500
 the old world scorecard from us

716
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,900
 and empower us to live in a new way?

717
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,660
 But bro, I see that in you every day as your close friend,

718
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,780
 and I see how you're giving yourself away,

719
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:42,140
 and you today are working with professional athletes

720
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,980
 on basically this very thing.

721
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,100
 You had shared a story about a very famous athlete

722
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,180
 within the NBA named Wayne Simian,

723
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,300
 and we have his permission to share the story,

724
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,660
 but can you just kind of share,

725
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,740
 as you're working with a player today in Spain,

726
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,260
 a story that Wayne told you that really connects here?

727
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,740
 - Yeah, I think it resonates with a lot of us

728
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,420
 like high-pressure athletes, you know, like goal-driven,

729
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,140
 so what happened was what you showed earlier

730
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,980
 on the scorecard was what the media does,

731
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,100
 but in the game, there's an actual stat sheet

732
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,980
 that tells rebounds, assists, turnovers,

733
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,180
 steals, points, all the stats of the game,

734
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,780
 and a lot of times, what us players do

735
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,260
 is we go right in the locker room,

736
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,020
 and the first thing we grab

737
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,460
 is we wanna see the score sheet.

738
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,700
 We wanna see the stat sheet.

739
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,820
 We wanna see how we did.

740
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,860
 - How did you do?

741
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,220
 - Yeah, exactly, so our eyes go right to us, right?

742
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,620
 And I think that's natural.

743
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,300
 If you ask any pro athlete, that's probably how did I do?

744
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:54,220
 And so what that causes is if you have a bad game,

745
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,180
 if you have a good game, there's good feelings,

746
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,240
 and you're happy, and you win, and all that,

747
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,060
 but if there's a bad game, you can kinda go in the dumps,

748
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:06,780
 and what one of my friends, Wayne Simeon, said was,

749
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,740
 "I stopped going into my locker when I sat down.

750
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,540
 "I didn't grab the stat sheet.

751
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,840
 "I grabbed a note card that had all the truth

752
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,540
 "in the scripture about who I am in God's view."

753
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,380
 - Wow.

754
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,620
 - And so he changed the stat,

755
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,860
 like literally changed the stat sheet.

756
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,740
 - Scorecard switch. - And he picked up

757
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,540
 this scorecard and started going to the truth.

758
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,060
 I am the light of the world.

759
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,660
 I am God's child.

760
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,540
 I am his son.

761
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,420
 I am a heir.

762
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,100
 I'm a co-heir with Jesus,

763
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,300
 and he started just going down the scripture

764
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:41,860
 of this scorecard and the truth in the scriptures,

765
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,580
 and I think that kinda raised my awareness

766
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,340
 to what I was doing as a player, and I'm still doing,

767
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,180
 and how I can shift into that,

768
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,860
 and I think a lot of players,

769
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,860
 that would resonate, that story, and it has,

770
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,780
 as I've been talking to other pro players.

771
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,460
 - Yeah, and I think whether you're a business leader,

772
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:06,460
 whether you work at home, wherever we are, we can relate.

773
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,260
 We all have a scorecard,

774
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,460
 and that's the first thing that we go to,

775
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,140
 and that's the invitation for all of us.

776
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,980
 I love that you wrote a letter, you said.

777
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,820
 Did you write that to God?

778
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,140
 I know you got baptized later.

779
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,540
 Was that letter written to God?

780
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,500
 - Mm-hmm, yeah.

781
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,220
 I wish I still had it, but I think it was just empty,

782
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,740
 basically just the confession

783
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,420
 of how I'd been living my life,

784
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,740
 and what I wanted.

785
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,100
 I wanted more of him, and less of what I'd been going after,

786
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,540
 and so, yeah, that relationship took on a whole new meaning,

787
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,580
 and it continues to grow day by day.

788
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,820
 - Well, I know God still has that letter.

789
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,340
 We'll get to see it in the kingdom one day, my brother.

790
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,980
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

791
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,420
 Hey, would you just join me in saying thank you to Ryan

792
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,180
 for sharing his story?

793
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,700
 So, thank you so much, Ryan.

794
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,540
 - Thanks for having me.

795
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,940
 It was a pleasure to be here.

796
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,700
 - Awesome.

797
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,980
 Well, as Ryan transitions,

798
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,300
 let me just go ahead and give his email out

799
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,740
 so that you can send your complaint

800
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,220
 about his preference for American basketball.

801
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,700
 I really wanna say sorry for that, Hong Kong,

802
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,500
 but isn't that a beautiful thing, though?

803
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,260
 A real-life story of someone who has learned

804
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,780
 and is learning how to say,

805
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,660
 "Jesus, you keep a different score,

806
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:31,660
 "and it's a radical score, and it's filled with grace,

807
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,880
 "and where I might feel like a two in my life,

808
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,600
 "you say I'm a 10,

809
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,120
 "where I might feel like I'm a negative 18,

810
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:42,040
 "you say, hey, listen, you can't score any higher

811
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,200
 "because of my love for you."

812
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,720
 Jesus looks at you,

813
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,140
 just like he looked at the rich young ruler.

814
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,860
 Jesus hears you if you're feeling trampled

815
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,580
 by all those passing by,

816
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,240
 and he says, "You're essential.

817
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,420
 "You were born with the dignity

818
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,360
 "since before the foundations of the world.

819
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,420
 "You're a 10 in my heart."

820
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,740
 And that's why I went to this place called Planet Earth,

821
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,280
 that's why I surrendered my life.

822
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,240
 All the things that Jesus did are right here.

823
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,280
 He said, "I'm gonna go last.

824
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,500
 "I'm gonna seek solidarity and commonality with you

825
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,120
 "as human beings, being fully God and fully human,

826
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,620
 "and I'm gonna give my life away,

827
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,900
 "and I'm gonna abandon the grave on the third day."

828
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,740
 Why?

829
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:32,800
 Because you are essential.

830
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,560
 All that I have created and called good and very good

831
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,840
 is essential, and I'm taking it back for good.

832
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,220
 That's the invitation.

833
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,720
 The call of Jesus, I'm keeping a different score,

834
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,800
 and it's time to change teams.

835
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,040
 So cheer up, O church.

836
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,040
 On your feet, he's calling you to a new scorecard,

837
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,020
 because that's the new way that we win.

838
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,720
 In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,

839
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,160
 we say and pray together, amen.

840
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:16,160
