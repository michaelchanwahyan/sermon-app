[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   Right, thank you Pastor Johnny. Thank you so much for the prayer as well. Yes, so it is the very last
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:16.480]   sermon worship of this year for us and it's exciting to be here sharing a message with you
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.040]   tonight. Now the topic that we'll be doing is the last on our Siri Advent to Christmas. It is on the
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.320]   topic of Prince of Peace. Now this year is kind of nothing but peace, right? We have COVID that's
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:39.440]   affected literally everyone on earth and yet you know we as Christians we hear about the Prince of
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.920]   Peace all the time and to some extent we really want to know how is it that we can experience this
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.600]   peace and so today I'm just really glad to be sharing this message and I'm going to give you
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.880]   three steps. I don't know why everything's in threes but I'm going to give you three steps so
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.000]   that you could experience the peace from Jesus. Now who wants to know how to experience peace
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   from Jesus? Can you put up your hand? There we go. I see a few hands there. Yep, good. I'm glad
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.200]   I'm not preaching to myself but then we're all listening to it but if nobody's listening I'm
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.320]   very glad to hear this message myself because sometimes what we hear is that the Bible promises
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.160]   us peace all the time but it might be that we're not experiencing that in our lives and we wonder
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.720]   you know did we miss out on something or we hear of other people experiencing that peace. So today
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.320]   hopefully after we have all shared these three steps that we could all experience it from Jesus
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.520]   our Prince of Peace. So let's start by looking at the verse that we have been for a few weeks now.
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:03.040]   It is from Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6. For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.320]   government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:20.400]   Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Now if we want to live in Jesus's peace we have to go to
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.840]   him to find out what it is that we can achieve it but before that instead of asking you what is
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.080]   peace to you I actually want to ask you another question which is how is it that we would lose
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.760]   peace sometimes. So here's my question to you what makes you lose your peace? Now could you all share
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.080]   your thoughts on chat and I'll read them out as I see them. What makes you lose your peace?
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:58.240]   Worry. Okay good Agnes says worry what kind of what things makes us worry? Kids, work, all right.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:09.360]   Frustrations with events, good. Anything else? Anything that would make us lose our peace?
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   Financial insecurities, good. And sometimes we might lose our job right or mismatch between
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:27.040]   expectation and reality. Yes not trusting God. These are all great answers. COVID-19,
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.800]   yes. And health conditions, wow you guys are great with these. Yeah thank you so much everyone and we
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:43.040]   see that a lot of times we can lose our peace because the circumstances around us continue to
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.880]   change and it might be our health issues as some of you have mentioned and it could be financial
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.560]   issues or relationship issues or that we don't trust in God and so I did a little google. I said
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.080]   how do we lose peace? Okay so this is what it came up with. Trying to control things or even people.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:16.000]   Trying to make things happen when the timing isn't right and so what we realize is that we lose our
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.520]   peace when we lose control and so really the other question I want to ask is why is it that when we
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.440]   have control over these things we actually have peace? Well most of the time it's because we have
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:40.320]   a sense of security and we feel safe because if we know what's about to happen we feel safe and
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:47.360]   this sense of security helps us to have peace but you know in life we do know that there are a lot
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.600]   of things that we cannot control so today you know really we want to look at how is it that we can
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:01.760]   still have peace when things don't go our way? When we might have our family member or even
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.040]   ourselves suffer from illness or we might be losing our job or we know friends who are
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:14.160]   or just simply we have relationship problems. How can we still say that we could have peace at this
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:26.720]   time? And so today when we look at Isaiah chapter 9 verse 2 we'll also see another verse from verse
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:36.320]   2 it says the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light those who dwell in a land of
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:44.080]   deep darkness on them has light shown. Now this is a few verses prior to the one that we've just read
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:52.000]   and what we see here is that the people the Israelites have been walking in darkness. Now
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.960]   why was it that they were walking in darkness? And we find out from the few verses above or in between
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:10.000]   verse 2 and 6 sorry from chapter 8 and to chapter 9 is that we see the king Iseria they have been
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.040]   invading the land in Israel and they were mostly affected in the land of Zebulun and Neftali
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:24.640]   because they were from the northern part and so they were invaded by this king so they've been
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:32.480]   walking in this darkness and there was no hope for this people. But the first point that I wanted to
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:40.000]   bring is that we can still have peace if we're able to see the light just like what Isaiah is
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:51.200]   saying here when we see the light Jesus in your darkness then we are able to have peace. So right
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.880]   now I want to do a bit of experiment and what I'm going to say is that let there be no light
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:06.720]   do not be afraid when my screen goes dark. And I want to really show you what it felt like
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:16.400]   when we are invaded or when we are troubled by the circumstances in our lives. This is what we feel
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:26.320]   like total darkness and Jesus is the light and I'm gonna light a candle here. I just want to ask to
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:37.040]   all experience how a light in a dark place cuts through that darkness and it brings out a pathway
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:45.680]   a possibility a hope to us. And really the first point that we have when we're in this darkness
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.080]   or when we have a situation where we feel like we just can't go on anymore that we have trouble and
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:58.880]   we don't know what to do we're anxious we're worried the very first thing that we need to focus
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:09.840]   on isn't the darkness but that there's light and that is Jesus. Jesus is amongst us he's right here
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:19.280]   with you during those dark times and that's the beginning step one of finding peace. Now I shall
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:28.560]   say let there be light again and voila we have light again. And so I wanted us to experience
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.240]   that darkness because it's interesting how Isaiah didn't say they were going through a lot of
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:42.720]   oppression which he did state it earlier but he wanted us to feel what they felt inside the heart
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:49.760]   and also their vision was only darkness and sometimes that's what's happening in our lives too.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:59.280]   It isn't really the bad situations that get us to worry or be anxious but not knowing what's
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:07.440]   going to happen that makes us anxious and also not having hope that makes us scared and fearful.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:15.520]   So that's step one for us. Now as we read on in the different verses that's to come
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:28.080]   we also see that in the Bible verse, verse three to five, Isaiah tells us that when this light
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:35.920]   comes in that their nation will be multiplied and that their joy would be increased not only that
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:41.040]   but they'll win the battles so that they would divide the spoils among themselves.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:50.400]   And just like the day when it was the Gideon when we studied the book of Judges in the days of Midian
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:57.840]   knights when they won against them that's what's going to happen to the Israelite in this vision
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:06.000]   that Isaiah sees and that every boot of the trampoline warrior and all of their battle
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:13.200]   gears is going to be burned up for fuel because they don't need them anymore. So this really leads
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:23.600]   us to think that this light isn't just a light that oh it feels nice in my heart but this light
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:30.560]   will bring deliverance it brings hope that whatever situation we're in he will deliver us.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:39.360]   And so as we read on to verse six which we started at the beginning and also in this series
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:47.360]   we can see that all of this is possible because of one thing that a child is born.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.160]   And interestingly enough Isaiah could have just stopped there as a child is born and the
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:01.520]   government shall be upon his shoulder but he says specifically a son is given and this is really
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:07.840]   trying to allude us to remember the promise that God has which is that he will give his
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:18.720]   very own son to us and he shall ring upon all his people. And so as we read this we will know
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:28.800]   that it is Jesus this that is the light it is Jesus that this government and this ring shall be upon.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:39.360]   So the second point that I want to share with you is that peace after it comes is actually
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:47.040]   it depends on if we follow him. Now I want to speak a little bit into that
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:54.880]   because we see that when Jesus came peace didn't immediately enter into people's heart.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:02.320]   Actually many people don't even have peace today even though Jesus is born and he has risen from
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:10.160]   the dead. So how come we're still calling Jesus the prince of peace and how is it that we can
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:21.440]   attain it and the second step to attaining it is to follow Jesus. And we see this because as
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:33.200]   as the bible verse shares with us he actually says that when he came there was a time where the wise
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:40.320]   men came from the east and they searched high and low because of this star that they have seen in
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:46.560]   the sky this light that they saw and they said I'm just not going to see this light and continue my
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:54.080]   own things I'm actually going to follow this light I'm going to try to find this messiah the
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:02.640]   savior that has been promised and similarly oh I forgot to show this one and so they followed to
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:11.280]   find Jesus and similarly we see that there were shepherds in the field and when the angels came
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:18.400]   they told him that there would be a child that would be born onto them and they even said glory
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:26.480]   to God in the highest and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased and again we see
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:35.840]   peace and I want to be very straightforward which is peace that Jesus has isn't for everyone because
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:45.920]   it says here for whom he is pleased and who are those that God is pleased with well the thing is
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:57.600]   there is sin in our lives and unless Jesus helps us take those away we would never be a pleased
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:06.640]   offering or Jesus is the pleased offering in which through him would all be able to come
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.800]   before God and reconcile with him and have a relationship with him so that he would also be
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:19.680]   pleased with us because all our sins have been taken away and it is because of this that Jesus
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:29.200]   is also called the prince of peace because he reconciled our relationship with God and so peace
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:39.760]   then is to those who have accepted Jesus but not only that oh after we've accepted him it is those
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:48.560]   who continue to follow him and Jesus said also in the gospel of John verse 8 he says I am the
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:57.440]   light of the world whoever what follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:05.920]   life and we see here this peace or this light of the world is able to enter our heart when we
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:15.600]   follow Jesus because he is the light of the world and so what this really tells us is that not only
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.840]   do we see this light in the darkness or in the circumstances that we're going through
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:28.720]   but that we will go to him to repent of our sins and that we'll accept Jesus in order to have a
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:36.000]   reconciled relationship with God but then we'll need to continue to follow him if we want that
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:46.400]   light to live in our heart this peace to continue in our heart and so this actually naturally leads
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:59.600]   to our third point which is that as we follow him let me see this slide as we follow him peace
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:08.480]   through trusting that Jesus in control will allow us to feel the ultimate peace in our heart
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.880]   now let me explain a little bit about that because sometimes we feel like I've repented of my sin I
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:21.120]   I've done it many times because I've sinned different ways and I want to repent again but
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:29.040]   still I'm not feeling this peace well for one thing we have to find out what it means to follow
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:36.320]   Jesus because when we follow Jesus it means that we need to give up our ways of doing things
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:44.240]   remember how we mentioned that the reason that we lose peace is because we want control but when we
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:53.520]   start to follow Jesus we let go we're like open hand and we let go of our plans our desires
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:17:00.640]   and we follow his will and that might mean if he asks us to forgive someone we don't want to we'll
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:08.080]   do that and that might mean if we didn't feel like uh taking care of the poor or the widow but if he
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:16.560]   asked us to we'll want to do that it might be that we have a plan to to to to be a certain profession
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:25.200]   but if God calls us that we would give that up as well and follow his path so when we follow him
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.480]   we will start to sense the peace because we will no longer need to be in control
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:40.640]   and so that's why when we follow him we also know that if he's the one that's ultimately in control
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:48.720]   we don't have to worry and the third step was trusting that Jesus is in control
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:58.880]   and as we read verse 7 it says of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:05.440]   and on the throne of David and over his kingdom to establish it and to uphold it with justice
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:13.520]   with righteousness from time from this time forth and forevermore the seal of the lord of hosts will
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:21.040]   do this this verse is important to us as well because when we give up control sometimes we're
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:28.080]   scared because we don't know what's happening but since Jesus is the prince of peace he is the peace
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:37.760]   that has no end which means that is everlasting and that it's overriding everything it's beyond
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.640]   earth beyond heavens his throne is above everything and that's where his kingdom rings
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:54.800]   and so when we allow ourselves and let go of our own desires and will and to follow him
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:19:02.640]   we're not blindly following anybody we're following the prince of this world and we can
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:09.600]   rest assured that he has control and so I want to share a little bit with you about
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:22.160]   the the story of Mary because I think this story really allows us or captures how is it that we
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:33.040]   could follow God and sense the peace that he has promised us now Mary is the mother of Jesus
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:42.240]   and he would and she was engaged to Joseph now during their engagement she found out that she
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:50.160]   was impregnated with Holy Spirit now that's quite a curveball I'm engaged now and I cannot imagine
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:57.520]   how I would face the world if that had happened to me but let's not go there today so she followed
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:08.960]   God and after she found out this um announcement from the angel this is how she replied behold
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   I am the servant of the Lord let it be to me according to your word and then the angels
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:24.800]   departed from her now in the natural you would think this is really scary for teenage bride who's
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.480]   about to get married because she'll be worried about what would her future husband think what
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:38.320]   would her family think what would the society think of her but instead she was willing to follow God's
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:47.040]   will and said let it be to me according to your word and she followed God and I think if anybody
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:53.360]   like us in the natural probably like Mary at that time as well would think all right now that I'm
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:59.760]   following God's will everything is going to be smooth sailing from now on but of course we found
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:07.440]   out it isn't like that because soon after she'll be running for her life and she had to escape to
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:17.280]   Egypt because why King Harold wanted to kill all the infants that were younger than two years old
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:26.160]   and so can you imagine her following Jesus and yet still having all these troubles
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:33.280]   she must be thinking how did how did it all happen how come God's not protecting me that
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:40.560]   might be in the natural but according to how she had responded I am the servant of the Lord
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:48.880]   let it be to me according to your words and if she had continued on with this attitude
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:55.760]   she would have found peace which I believe Mary did even when she was running for her life because
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:04.000]   she knew that God would be in control now eventually Jesus grew up and after three years
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:13.680]   of ministering he was publicly humiliated scorned and hated and in the natural anybody would be
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:23.680]   thinking Lord what is going on what is going on how come you've given me a child and I have to
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:31.440]   see him suffer I mean it would only be natural for us to think like this don't you think because it's
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:46.000]   so hard to see what's happening even though you followed God when the situations isn't what you
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.400]   think or isn't what you have can have peace but I think Mary did at that time because not only
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:23:04.160]   did she submit it to God but then she knows that what she is submitting to someone whose kingdom
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:13.600]   is above earth whose kingdom is beyond time so that she doesn't need to worry and in hindsight
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:24.400]   we do know that it is because she was able to follow and because she's able to submit and
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   letting go whatever the outcome would be to God that she is able to find peace and eventually
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:42.800]   the Messiah would complete his mission through Mary now I want to encourage all of us that when
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:49.120]   we're going through troubled times and even after we've repented we've believed in God even after
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:57.280]   we've done everything we could to follow him and yet we still see the circumstances or the outcome
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:06.560]   not happening the way we want it to I want to encourage you that when we trust in Jesus and
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:16.640]   we're trusting God the Holy Spirit the Prince of Peace whose ring is above earth of beyond time
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:26.560]   that he knows what he's doing then this trust in Jesus would be one
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:36.160]   that is beyond all understanding and this is the peace I believe when Jesus came to his
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:44.400]   disciples and said peace I leave with you my peace I give you not as the world gives
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:52.240]   do I give you let not your hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid because this world
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:59.040]   when they give you peace is through the circumstances but the peace that Jesus is
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:08.720]   giving to us is a peace that says if you trust in me I will take care of the outcome I will triumph
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:15.280]   over everything it might not be the way that you're thinking in your head
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:24.320]   but I will ultimately have victory and triumph and this peace I want to say
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:32.000]   is one that surpasses all understanding because in the natural it shouldn't happen this way
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.560]   but our Jesus our God is supernatural he is beyond hobbies
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.800]   and so what about you
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:52.800]   do you trust that God knows what he's doing in your life do you trust that even at your darkest
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:26:00.640]   hour or your greatest frustration that there there is this light in the midst of it that
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:09.040]   Jesus is with you and are you willing to follow his ways maybe it means to give up your desires
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:17.520]   give up your selfish way of doing things and regardless of how things seems to be when you
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:25.200]   follow him are you willing to continue to trust him even though your eyes may not see those outcomes
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:31.760]   are you willing to follow him and if you have said yes to all these questions and I want to
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:40.320]   congratulate you because the prince of peace that light the true light of life lives in your heart
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   and I'm sure that you're experiencing that peace all the time but if you have said no to any one
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:57.760]   of these questions I want to say take heart because Jesus is the good news and he says that
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:05.440]   whenever you turn to him he's willing to give you that peace and I pray that you would ask God to
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:12.400]   help you to have a peace in your mind through seeing this light ask him to help you if you're
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:18.960]   in the darkness and ask him to help you to follow him to start letting go of the things that you're
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:30.880]   not willing to and ask him to help you to trust even when the outcome seems to not be what we want
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:42.240]   and so today I leave you with these three steps that as we see the light even in the darkness
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:50.800]   when we follow God's will leaving behind our own desires in our selfish ways
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:59.520]   that when we trust him even though we haven't seen his triumph but we trust that he has victory
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:07.920]   at the very end and then I want to say when we follow these three steps the peace of prince
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:16.960]   lives in our hearts and he is more than willing to leave this peace with us and so that no matter
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:24.000]   what we go through in life he's with us and his peace is with us so today we're going to sing
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.360]   the blessing together may Jesus the light of the world may his face shine upon you
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:40.160]   and as we sing it invite him invite him and ask him if you're struggling with trusting him how
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:46.640]   can you do it with all areas of your life whether it's health his work his family or relationship
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:54.960]   and so we just want to pray together in a moment and just want to recite one more time this bible
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:06.320]   verse for unto us a child is born to us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:15.440]   and his name shall be called wonderful counselor mighty God everlasting father prince of peace
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.560]   let us pray together
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:27.120]   dear heavenly father we thank you so much for giving us Jesus the light of the world
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:37.440]   to come into our darkness we were full of sins and yet Jesus took it all away
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:48.240]   because he loves us and we just thank you father that he is the wonderful counselor
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:56.720]   who has all the wisdom and he is the mighty God the one who has all the power
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:06.000]   the everlasting father beyond time and he's the prince of peace and father we just pray that you
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.600]   would help us that as we struggle sometimes to follow you father may your holy spirit help us
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:22.000]   and father help us to trust you even when we don't understand because you know what you're doing
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.560]   you're in control and you reign above everything so father help us today to receive this blessing
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:34.880]   of peace in Jesus Christ name we pray amen
