[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   So one, two, three, let's all go together.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   One, two, three, let's all go together.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   One, two, three, let's all go together.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   He leads me besides the still waters.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   He restores my soul.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   He leads me in the paths of righteousness for His namesake.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   I will fear no evil.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   For you are with me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Wow.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Two weeks ago, I had a full medical.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Now, when I mean full medical, I mean full.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Everything that could be tested was tested.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   It took over five hours.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Nervously, I waited for the results.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Five days later, still no results.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I want you to picture this.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I'm in bed and the inevitable voice came to my mind.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Just as I was trying to get to sleep.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Why haven't you heard?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Perhaps there is something seriously wrong.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   What is it?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Now, fortunately, on this occasion, I had the answer.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   It had come in a book I had just read.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   A book written by Louis Giglio.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   A book with the unlikely title,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   "Don't Give the Enemy a Seat at Your Table."
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I was not having any of it.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Now, Louis is actually an old friend.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You see the picture up here.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   This picture was taken on 2008 here in Hong Kong
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   when I was a young man, right?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Sandra and I attended his first ever service
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   at Passion City Church in Atlanta.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   And pre-COVID, if he was ever in Hong Kong,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   usually for a few hours layover,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   we'd try and grab a quick coffee together.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   By the way, the medical was all clear.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   But I had had to learn my lesson the hard way.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   As many of you will know,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I've been suffering from mild clinical depression
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and quite recently have been on antidepressants
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   and anti-anxiety tablets.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Now, looking back, it had little to do
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   with either COVID or political protests.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And by the way, it had nothing to do with KFC.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I just want to say that.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   But it had everything to do with 18 months
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   of relentless noisy renovation by my next door neighbors.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   (Laughter)
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And me allowing it to dominate me
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   rather than me dealing with it.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   In fact, I dealt with it very badly.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And quite frankly, I lost it.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   If you want to know more, ask Sandra.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   But as I discovered in Louis' book,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I realized I had given the enemy a seat at my table.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And I'll explain this later.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   But let's move forward.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I've got to say, I loved, I mean, absolutely loved
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   our Women in the Old Testament series
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   that we finished last week.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And it was on the 22nd of May,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Pastor James was preaching.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   He was preaching on Rachel and Leah.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And he highlighted how envy, do you remember?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Envy had taken control.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It started from Rachel's original barrenness.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And it caused any amount of problems
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   and babies all over the place to wives and concubines.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   And that's how we got to get the 12 tribes of Israel.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   But then it hit me.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   I had a eureka moment.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   How often had I allowed envy a seat at my table?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   How often do we allow envy a seat at our tables?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Having asked the question, I didn't like the answer.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And for envy, substitute fear, worry, insecurity, anxiety,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   temptation, lust, or a hundred other things.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And that was the very moment I decided to introduce
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   this series to KFCI.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And today is a sort of appetizer for a wonderful main course.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   And I hope it whets your appetite.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   But I need to tell you this evening, KFCI, it is time.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I know I sound like the Lion King at Disney, right?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It is time.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   It is time for us as Christians to win the battle for our minds.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   It is time to discover with the Bible,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   the Word of God is our weapon,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   how to break free from the chains of negative thinking
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   and experience true freedom from unhealthy thoughts and emotions.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And my friends, these nine words are possibly
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   nine of the most important words that you will ever hear.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   They might just change your life.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And those words are,
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Let me repeat it.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   In fact, let's all repeat it.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   One, two, three.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   You see, the enemy is constantly seeking to fill our minds
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   with destructive and harmful thoughts.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Whether as I have mentioned, fear, worry, insecurity, anxiety, temptation, envy.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   It is all too easy for Satan to manipulate his way into a seat at the table
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   intended for only us and Jesus
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   and trying to make a home in our minds.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It is an ongoing battle,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   but it is one we can win.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   In this series, we will share over 10 weeks
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   some practical ways to overcome the enemy's lies
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   and instead find God's peace and security
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   in any challenging circumstance or situation.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   To set the scene, I've put up the 10 weeks.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   It's a spoiler alert, right on.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   But by drawing from Psalm 23 as a framework,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   what we're gonna do is we're gonna offer biblical insight
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   onto how to cancel the lies that will wreck your lives.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   How to take empowering steps to live fully alive in Christ.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   How to stop the spiral of shame, temptation, and insecurity.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   How to restore peace and rest in your life.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   How to embrace the true purpose behind your journey
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   through challenging circumstances.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And how to break free from the endless cycle of destructive thinking.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Does that sound good?
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   That sounded good to two of you.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   That's good, excellent.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   It sounds good to me.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   You can find freedom from the war inside your mind
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   if and only if you allow Jesus,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   the Good Shepherd, to lead the battle.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   We will learn together how to find encouragement,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   hope, and strength no matter what valleys you face.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   It's time to reject the lies and listen to the truth.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Friends, you don't have to let your thoughts run wide.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   You don't have to allow the enemy to influence your thinking.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   You have power through Jesus Christ
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   to take control of your thoughts and emotions.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Jesus invites you to a table He has prepared for you.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   A table where the enemy is not invited.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So let's take a realistic look at where most of us, if not all of us, where we are.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Our minds spinning seemingly out of control with thoughts
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   that are not only unproductive, but potentially destructive and harmful.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   And I need to tell you this evening, these thoughts are not from God.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   No, they're from an enemy.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   He's lurking, ready to seize any opportunity to lie His way into your mind
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   and claim control over your life.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I believe what we are going through together in Hong Kong at present is confusion.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Confusion reigns over our city.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   We are a divided, isolated community.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   We don't trust each other.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Depression and mental illness is rife.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   There are so many voices coming at us.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And my research says that particularly our younger generation,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   our younger generations are confused.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   And one of the main things that they're hearing from authority figures,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   parents, teachers, society in general, is this,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   you're not good enough.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   You're not good enough.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   You're not as clever, beautiful, funny as your siblings, your friends.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   You won't be able to get a job, buy an apartment.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   You won't find the right person to marry.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   And we are hearing those voices in our head.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Maybe like me, as I'm trying to go to sleep.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Lauren Daigle in the first verse of the wonderful song, which we'll sing later,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   "You Say" says this, I'll put it on the screen.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I keep fighting voices in my mind that say, I'm not enough.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Every single lie that tells me I will never measure up.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   That is what today's generation are hearing.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And I'm here tonight to tell you that you are good enough.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And that just doesn't come from me.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   This is not the word of Pastor John.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   This is God's word for you.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And God has other plans for you.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Better plans where you can experience intimacy, rest and joy beyond your circumstances.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   I for one, I'm looking, looking forward to this journey.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   And James, Johnny, Michelle, and can I put a plug in for Paul?
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Paul will be our next generation speaker.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   We're going to be part of this series and they will be joining me.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   Are you excited about that? I'm excited, Paul.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Now to do this, we're going to take a fresh look at Psalm 23.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   We read it earlier. It's possibly the most famous chapter in the Bible.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   It's read at weddings, funerals.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   It's on posters and bookmarks from the Elym bookstore.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   And one that we could probably all recite by heart.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   But if we are not careful, we can miss the power, the grit, the promise and the possibility of this Psalm.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   It was written by David, King David, who had experienced far worse situations than his next door neighbor's renovations.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Life threatening situations and who had seen God deliver.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   This is not a quiet, soft, fluffy Kumbaya Psalm.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   This is a gritty Psalm from someone who had lived a life, seeing his whole future in the balance and seeing God come through.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   The invitation is powerful.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   And David opens with this line.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   The Lord is my shepherd. In fact, no, he doesn't. He opens with the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Notice he doesn't say the Lord is a shepherd.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   But mine.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I think David was proclaiming his personal connection with God.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Certainly David knew he was talking about the God of heaven and earth, the ruler of the universe, the almighty and omnipotent one.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   But that very moment he was simply thinking, he's mine.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   It was Percival.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And I want to challenge you whether you're here in the room, whether you're in the overflow, whether you're online tonight.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   If the Lord is not your shepherd, if you can't sing that, the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   I'm going to invite you to make a decision at the beginning of this 10 weeks.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   It will change your life.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I will give you that opportunity before we finish.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   I'm very excited about next week when Pastor James will be taking a fresh look at a sort of remix version to use a musical term, as it were, of Psalm 23.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   He's going to lead us next week and indeed in all the messages to follow to see this famous chapter with new eyes.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Be prepared.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And the line I want to focus on this evening is this one. It's found in verse 5.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Now, if you and I were writing the Bible, I mean, we didn't write, but if you and I were writing the Bible,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   we would probably have written this verse a little bit differently.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   I would have written, "You prepare a table before me in your presence."
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Maybe a window seat.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   "And you scatter my enemies."
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   But this table is in the presence of my enemies.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   Now, to help me, I've set up this table.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I know you've been wondering about it since you came in tonight.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   And I need your help.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I need you to use your imagination.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I'll be honest with you. I wanted to prepare a lavish banquet for you.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   But I had fancy ideas.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   But thanks to Bonnie and Taobao,
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   our reconstruction allows you to imagine a Michelin three-star set up with the finest wines,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   fruit, bread, and lots of goodies.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   In fact, it's so good, I think I want to take a selfie.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   I want to take one and post it on IG or Facebook or something.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   I've got a few in the background. That's lovely. Let's do one on this side. Good.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   One from the top. Yeah, that's lovely. Thank you very much.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Good. But look, the analogy breaks down a little bit.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   For this illustration, you have to represent the enemy.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Now, I just want to say you are not my enemy.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   In fact, the opposite. You're my friends.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   You're my friends.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   But please play along with me for the next 20 minutes.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   In fact, let's get the acting going.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   I know you've got masks on and things like that, but can you give me a sort of enemy growl?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   Can you ready? One, two, three.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   That was so good.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   What I want you to do now is to look at this table.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   There's just two seats.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   It was like the beginning of COVID, right?
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   There were just two seats.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   One is obviously for me.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   But the other one is for the Good Shepherd.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   The one who wants to fulfill all my needs.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Lead me in green pastures, by the still waters.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   The one who restores my soul.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   The one who leads me in righteousness and takes me through the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   I want you to get a picture in your mind.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   You've been invited to a banquet.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Think of the most lavish banquet you've ever attended.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   I think it was Michelle's wedding when she was only allowed 40 people and you had the whole -- 20 people and you had the whole hotel, right?
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   It was lavish.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   But you know when you go to these Hong Kong banquets, you go in and they say, oh, you're on the top table, right?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   But today, you're not only on the top table, it's just two people.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   You and the Good Shepherd.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Your shepherd has prepared a table just for you.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Now, I've got to say that this table did not mean that my enemies, right, would be removed from the equation.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   In fact, the table was set right in the middle of my enemies.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   I didn't need to earn my invitation.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   They didn't even ask me for my leave home, save app or take my temperature.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   I didn't have to show I am smart, vaccination proof.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   I didn't have to prove how good a Christian I am.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   How many services I've attended.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   How many times I've read the Bible from cover to cover.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   How many hours I spend in prayer every day.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   How much witnessing I've done this week.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   I didn't have to clear my name.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I didn't need to work overtime to improve my chances of an invitation.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   My sole task is to concentrate on the Good Shepherd.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   The one who owned the table.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   My invitation was simply to put my trust in the one who wants to fulfill my needs,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   leads me in green pastures, by the still waters.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   The one who restores my soul, leads me in righteousness and takes me through the darkest valleys and threatening nights.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   The Good Shepherd would anoint my life with his favour and my cup would overflow.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   My promise, goodness, mercy and love would escort me every single day of my life.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   My destiny was set.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   I didn't need to be afraid.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   The Shepherd was on the table and he would see that I am going to dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   I'm going to suggest that you spend these next 10 weeks reflecting on the truth of this Psalm.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   Now I know you've read this Psalm a million times before.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   I'm going to suggest this to you, that you read it daily.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And you sit there with a pen and paper. Do you remember those? Pen and paper?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Or the notes app, it's okay.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And start to write down the thoughts that God gives you.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   I believe the practice of biblical meditation is sadly lacking in this hurried, busy environment we live in.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Now biblical meditation isn't merely reading or studying God's Word,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   but musing and mulling over God's Word, whereby it grips our heart.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   In other words, its goal isn't to fill the head, but to improve your heart.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   We get our lessons from nature, from the cow.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Do you know how many stomachs a cow has? Four.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And when the cow chews on the cud, it chews on it in one stomach, then moves it to another stomach, etc.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Really, my friends, you're not enemies for a moment, my friends, let it burrow into your soul.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   And can I make a suggestion?
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   Now would be a really good chance, if you're not in a clan, to join a clan.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Most of our clans will be looking at this passage over the next 10 weeks.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   But what this tells me is this, is that 1 Peter 5, 8 is 100% true.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   It says this, Peter says this, "Be sober-minded, be watchful.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   The fact of life is the devil is going to prowl around our lives.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And actually, sometimes the closer we get to God, the more the devil is prowling around.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   Now, using this illustration, we cannot stop him prowling around our table.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   But you do have the choice whether you allow the enemy to sit down.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Don't give the enemy a seat at your table is more than a helpful quote, a bumper sticker, a summer sermon series.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   My prayer for us at KFCI is that these nine words become a weapon and a weapon that leads to freedom.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   This is a story of a good shepherd who sees you and walks you, with you through the valley.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   It's about a God setting a table of nourishment and refreshment in the midst of trouble.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   This message lets you see how you don't need to let the thoughts in your head run wild.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   These words, "Don't give the enemy a seat at your table," are ultimately a message of victory.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   That's why we've chosen to do this series.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   It is different from our normal teaching series.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   But we want to help you, help you see that you have power through Jesus Christ to take authority over who sits at your table,
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   over who influences your thinking.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   You can take back your freedom and control your thoughts and emotions.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   You don't need to be trapped by fear, despair, or rage.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Your mind doesn't have to be stressed.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   You don't need to wrestle anymore with harmful thoughts.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   You are invited to an intimate relationship with the Almighty.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   The table He's prepared for you is one of peace, clarity, and abundance.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   You don't have to give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Come with us on this 10-week journey.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   And we can discover together ways to defeat the lies and find victory, peace, and security in the midst of any changing circumstance or situation.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   And I believe that you'll never look at Psalm 23 in quite the same way again.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Mind my words, the devil wants nothing more than to crush you.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   If he can claim the victory over your mind, he will eventually claim victory over your life.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   But the message of Psalm 23 is that the Good Shepherd prepares a table for you.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   It is a table for two only and the devil is not invited to sit down.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   And I want to tell you, I'm in this battle with you.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   So are your pastors and leaders.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   I'm preaching this message to myself over and over again.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And I'm confident our Good Shepherd will be glorified as He leads us in the battle for our minds.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   So let's go there together, me and you.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   It's time to take back what the enemy has taken.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And I'm going to ask you to take a huge step here as I ask the band to come back.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   And we celebrate the body and blood of our Savior in the partaking of communion.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   I've deliberately kept the sermon a little bit short.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Not just so we can do communion, but so we can do business with God.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   As the communion is being passed around, I want you to take hold of it.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   But firstly, we're going to sing a response song.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   I guess if everybody was in the room and there was no COVID, I'd tell you what I'd really like to do now.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   I'd like to come around to each one of you, put my arms around you, and tell you what God really thinks of you.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   We're going to sing that song in a moment, the chorus, and it says this.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   You say I'm loved when I can't feel a thing.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   You say I'm strong when I think I'm weak.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   You say I'm held when I'm falling short.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   And when I don't belong, you say I am yours.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   I want you as we sing this song together to own it, to own those words.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   You've got a choice today.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   You can listen to all those voices, and they're going to keep coming at you.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Or you can listen to God.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   This is my daughter, my son.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   I love you.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   I am yours.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   But before we do that, can we just close our eyes?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   I did promise you at the very beginning, and if you're online or in the overflow rooms, maybe you would want to do this.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   I just want to give an opportunity at the beginning of this series for anyone who is here, whether in person or online, to receive Jesus Christ as their Savior.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   So you'll be able to say the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   He's not somebody we read about in a book, somebody I hear about at church.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   He's not even in a way the supreme being of the universe.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   He is, but he's also my shepherd because I have a personal relationship with him.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And if you today would like to take that step and ask him to come into your life, we'd love to pray for you.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   I just want to allow the Holy Spirit just to have his way amongst us.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   Just while every eye is closed, I'm only really speaking about the people in the hall that can't see everybody else.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   While every eye is closed, if you know today that you need to surrender your life to Jesus Christ for him to become your shepherd,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   I'm going to ask you to do one very, very simple thing just while every eye is closed.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Could you just raise your hand so I can see your hand?
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Thank you.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Anybody else?
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Thank you at the back.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   I see that one.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Good.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Please don't go from here today until you've spoken to somebody.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   There's at least two people, we had two people in the room.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Maybe more in the overflow, more at home.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   I think for the benefit of those, the shepherd leaves the 99 to go and take the one, right?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Can we just pray together?
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Maybe that gentleman, that lady, can just pray this in your heart.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   Maybe repeat after me.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Father God.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Father God, I want you to be my shepherd.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   I thank you for sending Jesus to die for me.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Jesus, I surrender my life and I receive your life.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Be my shepherd.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Draw close to me and fill me with your presence.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   All that I am, all that I have, I surrender to you now.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   In Jesus' name.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   Amen.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I think it would be really good if we could sing this together.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Stay seated.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Just allow these words to seep into you.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Make them personal for you.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Then afterwards I'll come and lead you in a communion together.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.580]   (gentle music)
