[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   It's such a distinct joy to be with you this morning.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.640]   I want to begin with a simple question.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.560]   What's your prized possession?
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.440]   What do you consider a cherished possession in your life?
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.600]   For me, one of my prized possessions
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.600]   comes through a birthday greeting
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.440]   of my daughter, Belisha.
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.600]   And she's sitting in front telling me, don't call me
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.960]   to stand, don't call me to stand.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.800]   I want to read to you the birthday greeting,
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.920]   and I'll tell you why.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.800]   She said, happy birthday to the number one dad in the world.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.920]   Thank you for being there when I needed you, even when I didn't.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.360]   Thank you for teaching me manners.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.200]   Thank you for teaching me to be humble
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.600]   and to give honor when honor is due by modeling it yourself.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.320]   Thank you for not giving up on me,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.720]   even during my rebellious years.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.960]   When I came home late, lied to you, made you wait,
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.280]   and was always late.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.920]   Thank you for giving me so many second chances.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.120]   Thank you for training me in public speaking.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.960]   Thank you for helping me to constantly achieve an A grade
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.400]   in English and literature.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.280]   Thank you for giving me such a beautiful name, Belisha,
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.400]   which means dedicated to God.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.080]   Thank you for reminding me I'm loved, even when you are angry,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.360]   you pick me up when I fall.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.080]   Thank you for the chocolate milks, chocolate milkshake,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.000]   and chocolate cakes.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.480]   Thank you for countless opportunities.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.760]   Thank you for my education.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.800]   Thank you for bringing me to your workplace,
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.080]   to your meetings, and even on overseas trips with you.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.080]   Thank you for making me the most well-traveled
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.840]   among my friends and even teachers by the age of seven.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.560]   Thank you for always offering to drive me to school and work
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.120]   in time, for picking me up even in the middle of the night.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.840]   Thank you for always prioritizing Amanda and me
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.160]   over work, despite your busy schedule.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.040]   Thank you for reminding me adopted means loved.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.760]   Thank you so much.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.840]   Sorry, there's so much to thank you for, so much honored you,
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.400]   so many memories to cherish.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.960]   Even a lifetime of gratitude wouldn't be enough.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.120]   Most of all, I want to thank you for adopting me,
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.040]   because if you hadn't, none of this would have been possible,
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.480]   not even my life.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.800]   So thank you, Daddy.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.560]   I love you.
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.600]   Now, when Belisha said not even my life,
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.160]   I shared in a testimony in the Hong Kong Bible Conference,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.320]   she was a very sickly child.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.880]   We adopted her, brought her home, prayed for her.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.440]   And I'm very thankful the Lord healed her.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.800]   But I tell you why I read to you this birthday message,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.840]   because this is what I'm most grateful for.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.080]   When I read this, the primary thought that came to my heart
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.920]   is, "Oh, I'm so grateful I'm a great father."
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.320]   That wasn't in my heart, because I am a work in progress.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.440]   I'm also thankful for a wonderful daughter,
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.520]   but that wasn't the first thing in my heart.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.920]   I tell you what is the first thing in my heart.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.680]   I am very grateful that my daughter is grateful.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.440]   I'm grateful for her gratitude.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.760]   Because if she's grateful, then she
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.480]   wouldn't walk with a sense of a spirit of entitlement
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.280]   or presumptuousness.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.960]   This is what God looks to us as His children,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.440]   a spirit of gratitude, a spirit of thanksgiving.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.680]   That's why thanksgiving is so important in our worship.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.640]   Thanksgiving is so important in our discipleship.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.760]   And thanksgiving is so important in our leadership,
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.000]   so that we don't have a spirit of entitlement.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Out of us is a deep sense of gratitude.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Now, it's easy to talk about gratitude
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.360]   when things are going well.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.400]   It is very hard to talk about gratitude
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.760]   when we are in the wilderness.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.200]   So what I want to do this morning
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.880]   is to give us a perspective of the wilderness,
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.640]   so that we are able to understand with clarity
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.240]   what it means to walk with God, even in the wilderness,
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.120]   and have a sense of worship and gratitude
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.800]   that flows out of our life.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.280]   A key passage in the Scripture for us is in Isaiah 40.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.040]   And Isaiah 40 is a prophetic voice in the wilderness.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.920]   Before we explore it this morning,
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.880]   would you bow with me in a word of prayer
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.320]   and ask for the Lord's blessing?
[00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.720]   Eternal God and Heavenly Father, once again,
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.280]   open our eyes to behold your truth,
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.960]   so that we might behold you.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.880]   Help us to engage you and your truth
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.000]   with a sense of gratitude and joy
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.800]   for the power, the grace, and the glory
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.280]   of your wonderful favour and love towards us.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.920]   Help us, therefore, Lord, to understand
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.440]   that the wilderness is not a place that is terrifying.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.080]   It's actually a place that is therapeutic.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.520]   It heals us.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.200]   It directs us.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.080]   It teaches us.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.360]   For all this, we give you thanks in Jesus' name.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.760]   Amen.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.520]   You see, in life, we've got to understand
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.920]   things are not what they seem.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.320]   And one of the key things that's not what it seems
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.040]   is in the wilderness.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.960]   In one of my visits in Israel,
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.360]   there was a tour bus that took us around,
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.080]   and it passes through a wilderness.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.480]   And Hannah, our tour guide, said something brilliant.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.040]   She said, "Ah, the wilderness.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.960]   What a special place,
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.600]   because in the emptiness of the wilderness,
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.480]   God speaks.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.960]   In the wilderness of our life, God speaks."
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.080]   And so I want to connect us with reality,
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.960]   a reality of God breaking into our lives
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.680]   in every aspect, including the wilderness.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.040]   Now, I use the word wilderness as a metaphor of life,
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.720]   of the times of barrenness, the times of disconnectedness.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.120]   It can come through a miscarriage.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.280]   It can come through a retrenchment of our jobs.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.920]   It can come with a relational tension,
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.000]   or a marital problem, or parenting, or ministry.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.640]   Anything that gives us a sense of this connectedness
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.800]   is the wilderness we are walking through.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.480]   Turn with me in Isaiah 40,
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.680]   and we'll begin with verse 3 to verse 5.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.880]   Isaiah 40, verse 3 to verse 5 says,
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.200]   "In the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.680]   Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.400]   Every valley will be lifted up,
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.680]   and every mountain and hill be made low.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.280]   The uneven ground shall become level,
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.440]   and the rough places a plain.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.760]   And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.440]   and all flesh shall see it together,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.560]   for the mouth of the Lord has spoken."
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.960]   You see, in Biblical history,
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.000]   the wilderness was a journey from the bondage of Egypt
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.160]   into the Promised Land.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.120]   It was through the wilderness.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   40 years in the wilderness.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.520]   How do we get that 40 years in the wilderness?
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.120]   How did it come about?
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.000]   Because when they came out of Egypt into the Promised Land,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.480]   Moses sent 12 spies to spy the Promised Land
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.640]   and bring back a report.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.440]   So 40 days, they went to spy the land,
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.720]   and after 40 days, they came back.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.160]   Two spies gave a faith report, Joshua and Caleb,
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.440]   but the other 10 spies were report of doubt and unbelief.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.560]   And these reports discouraged the people.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.240]   They believed the 10 spies.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   They too were in doubt and unbelief,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.920]   and God judged them.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.000]   God says for every day, you spy the land
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.800]   and yet bring back the report,
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.760]   even though it's a good land, a Promised Land.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.360]   For every day, you have one year in the wilderness.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.480]   40 days, therefore 40 years.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.240]   The question we ask then is, why the wilderness?
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.080]   Why not?
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:32.000]   You are so unbelieving, send them back to Egypt.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:32.880]   Why the wilderness?
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.520]   There are two basic reasons.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.040]   One is God's promise.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.240]   Because of His promise to Abraham,
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.920]   that God has given the land,
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.360]   if every time the children of God are in disbelief,
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.840]   He sends them back to Egypt, sends them back to Egypt,
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.680]   they will never enter the Promised Land.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.880]   The wilderness was given by God,
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.080]   actually as His grace,
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.680]   as His grace to tutor them and to build up their faith.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.200]   So that's the second reason.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   It's the purpose of God to develop a people of faith.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.480]   We must understand that the wilderness is not just a place,
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.160]   not merely a place of punishment,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.400]   rather it's a place of development.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.040]   It is not a destination.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.000]   It is but a transit point.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.080]   In other words, this is important to learn.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.720]   Whatever wilderness you and I go through,
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.280]   God does not intend for us to live in the wilderness.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.320]   He intends for us to learn from the wilderness.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.560]   It's an important principle.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.000]   We don't live in the wilderness
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.640]   because it's not our destination.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.480]   It's a place by which we learn
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.880]   because it's our tuition centre.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   So when you're going through a very difficult time,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.120]   whatever the condition is in your life,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.040]   take it as God's tuition centre
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.120]   and you are paying the tuition fee
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.240]   in order to grow, in order to learn.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.040]   Now, there are good news
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.200]   and also bad news in the wilderness.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.160]   Let me give you the bad news first.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.440]   The bad news in the wilderness,
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.200]   number one, we can lose our bearing in the wilderness.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.240]   You see, the wilderness in Palestine
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.880]   is a place of emptiness, barrenness, there's nothing.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.440]   And in the desert, it is possible for people to be so lost
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:44.640]   that they wander around in circles and lose their bearing.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.760]   I'm a Singaporean in urban Singapore.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.560]   It's a small city.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.120]   It's not easy to get lost in Singapore.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.640]   The signs are everywhere.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:58.280]   You can have GPS, you can have so many other aids
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.280]   to help, ways to tell me where to go.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:07.920]   But once, I was lost in the wilderness in Africa.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:12.560]   No GPS because there's completely no signal.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.080]   Anne and I were with another elderly missionary couple,
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.440]   four in a car.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.360]   I was driving and we were looking for Johannesburg.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.440]   We were down south.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.440]   And what happened was that we couldn't find Johannesburg.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.320]   I went to ask for direction.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.480]   I was given a map.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.320]   I studied the map.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.040]   I think I know which road to take.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.840]   And we miscalculated again.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.680]   I'm Singaporean.
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.560]   We don't have four seasons.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.240]   Singapore has only one season and one weather.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:49.840]   Hot, still hot, very hot, and still very hot.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.080]   We don't have four seasons.
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.120]   And so I didn't know in the winter,
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.520]   the sun sets very quickly.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.480]   And so there in Africa, I thought I have,
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.960]   I was traveling at mid-afternoon.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.480]   I thought we have enough sunlight to drive on.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:08.600]   Suddenly I was caught with the sunset and darkness engulfed us.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.760]   When I say darkness engulfed us, it's complete darkness.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:18.120]   No street lamp, no street light, no street sign.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.560]   In other words, you imagine I was driving in the car,
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.840]   four of us.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.520]   I look in front in the headlamp.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.280]   I see nothing because the two beams shines into nothing.
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.560]   It's the wilderness.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.200]   Behind, I look behind, it is pitch darkness, nothing.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.440]   So it's just one road.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.440]   I don't know where it's leading to.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:42.640]   I travel miles and miles of nothing.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.280]   So I wasn't sure whether I'm headed the right direction.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.040]   Don't know where to go, no street light.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.720]   Finally, I decided to stop
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.360]   because I was hoping if I drive on for a while,
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.040]   maybe I can find some sign.
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.120]   There was nothing.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.720]   So I stopped the car by the side of the road.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.080]   I learned afterwards, I don't need to stop by the side of the road.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.760]   There's no car.
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.920]   There was nothing in the wilderness.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:08.400]   And I look up to look for the Northern Star
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.920]   because I'm traveling up north.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.800]   If I can find the North Star, the Southern Cross, the constellation,
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.640]   I'll be able to get the northern direction
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.640]   and get a sense of where Johannesburg roughly is.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.600]   I located the constellation of the Southern Cross,
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.520]   get my bearing where North is,
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.160]   headed towards that direction
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.320]   and eventually found Johannesburg.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.840]   I learned a lesson that day,
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.400]   when you are lost, look up.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.240]   Because God will always guide us when we look up.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.560]   The bad news in the wilderness is when there are no signs,
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.840]   when we don't know what is happening,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.360]   we lose our bearing and as a result, second bad news,
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.960]   we lose our confidence.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.280]   In other words, we become so disoriented,
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:58.240]   we don't know how to proceed in the wilderness.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:01.760]   There is a key that I want to pass to you that have helped me.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.680]   And that is, when you don't know what to do,
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.120]   you do what you know, you will know what to do.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:09.720]   Let me repeat that.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.040]   When you don't know what to do, you go back to basics.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:17.840]   You do what you know and then you'll know what to do.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.520]   I was talking to a surgeon, actually a gynaecologist.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.800]   He's one of the best trained overseas
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.880]   and he's a Malaysian doctor, Malaysian surgeon.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.720]   He told me that there are times when he was doing surgery
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:36.520]   and suddenly he sees things the textbook has never spoken of.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.240]   Never seen, never read before, never studied in medical school.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.280]   And in those times when it is a great uncertainty before him
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.800]   and he's right there in the surgery, what do you do?
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.000]   He says he remembered the teaching of his professor.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.840]   And that is, when you see something you've never seen before
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.520]   and you don't know what to do, always go back to the basics.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.200]   Always go back to the fundamentals
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.680]   because your top priority is to save life.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.440]   Go back to the fundamentals, it will save life.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:12.600]   When you don't know what to do, stick to the fundamentals.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.080]   Do what you know in the fundamentals
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.240]   and it will guide you in what you do.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.000]   You don't have to lose a sense of confidence and panic.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.040]   Get back to the fundamentals.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.320]   Third bad news, when we lose our bearing and our confidence,
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.520]   we tend to wander in the wilderness.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.200]   And that is why we meander around
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   because we are not sure where to go.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.240]   We are not sure how to proceed.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:43.840]   And that's why it's often called the wilderness wandering.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.560]   It is seen when travellers get lost in the desert.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.000]   When they trace back their steps,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.360]   you could see their steps walking.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.400]   They're actually walking around in circle.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.080]   They don't think they're walking around in circle.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.560]   They think they're walking straight,
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.720]   but they become so disoriented.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.760]   If you take a view from the top,
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.480]   you can see them walking around in a big circle.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.920]   They are wandering in the wilderness
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.880]   because they get disoriented and lost.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.720]   Now, here's the fourth bad news.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.800]   Wilderness wandering wearies us.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.400]   We get tired.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.240]   We can't make sense of what's going on.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.600]   We get confounded and we lose heart.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.520]   We get discouraged.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.240]   Very often in the wilderness of our life,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.440]   we go like, "Lord, how long will all this last?
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.920]   Why am I going through this again and again and again?"
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.320]   Cultivate patience because they are, as I said,
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.680]   tuition fees to be paid in the wilderness.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.400]   The fifth bad news is that the wilderness is a battleground,
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.280]   but it's a different kind of battleground.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.480]   It's not a battleground with armies and chariots outside.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.800]   It's a battleground within, without discouragement,
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:02.880]   fears, anxieties. It's an inner battle.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:07.320]   Ah, but there's good news in the wilderness.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:08.600]   Let me tell you some of this good news.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.320]   One, we can experience God's presence in the wilderness.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.200]   The Bible speaks of times of refreshing in the presence of God.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   So if whatever wilderness we are facing,
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.840]   whatever discouraging circumstances,
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:27.680]   enter the sanctuary into the presence of God.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:33.360]   Because in the sanctuary, we find times of refreshing.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:38.040]   The second good news, we can receive God's provision in the wilderness.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:42.000]   God is present and God will provide.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.600]   That's what the children of Israel learn.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.600]   That even in the wilderness journey, because of their unbelief,
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:55.000]   God has to give them the extra tuition God provided for them.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.640]   Nehemiah 9 is a historical recital of the faithfulness of God
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.840]   from the Exodus into the years of the wilderness,
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.720]   recorded in the book of Numbers.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.880]   And there in the historical recital of God's faithfulness,
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.640]   there are many times in that chapter, Nehemiah 9,
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:19.000]   where it says God provided, God supplied, God gave, God gave, God gave.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.080]   God provides in the wilderness.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.480]   That is why we have to anchor into His presence and have the confidence
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.520]   God will never lead you where His grace cannot keep you.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.080]   God will never lead you where His grace cannot keep you.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.520]   Because His grace will always be sufficient for us.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:45.160]   His strength always make perfect in our weaknesses.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:50.800]   Morning by morning, this has been a refrain in my prayer.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:55.000]   And that is the faithfulness of God and His grace.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.160]   His grace is sufficient for me.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.840]   His grace is sufficient for you.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   His strength is make perfect in our weaknesses.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:11.080]   So therefore, we can experience God's power in the wilderness.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:16.600]   Not just His presence or His provision, but His power.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:21.840]   And God shows His power to those who will trust Him and rely on Him.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.240]   His strength makes strong in our weaknesses.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:29.280]   So the key thing I learned in my faith journey is lean in on God,
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.680]   depend upon God, rest upon God.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:39.080]   Our posture makes a difference.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.880]   In one of the art galleries in London,
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:48.400]   there is an entire floor that is dedicated to Italian Renaissance art.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.560]   And one day there's an art professor by the name of Dr Robert Cumming,
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.920]   professor of the History of Art in Boston University.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.240]   He came to admire the art pieces of these Italian masters.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.160]   And he came before a painting by Lippi, the 15th century artist.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.320]   And the painting is called Virgin and Child.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.840]   He stood there to admire the painting.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.240]   But he said to himself,
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.880]   "There's something not quite right about this painting."
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:21.600]   But he couldn't put his finger upon what exactly is not quite right about painting.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.960]   He admired the brush strokes, he admired the colour,
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.240]   he admired the presentation of the art piece,
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.800]   but he can't tell there's just something, some proportion not quite right.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.160]   He can't figure out what it was.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.160]   And then finally the thought struck him.
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:45.040]   What if this art piece wasn't meant to be commissioned for an art gallery?
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:52.520]   What if this piece was meant for a prayer room, a prayer chamber?
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.760]   If it's a prayer chamber,
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.640]   they don't stand to admire the art piece like an art gallery.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.840]   They kneel.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.040]   So Professor Cummings did something he has never done in a gallery.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.600]   He knelt in front of the painting.
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.120]   And when he knelt in front of the painting,
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:08.800]   he looked up.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.400]   Oh, everything was in the right proportion.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.720]   Mary was holding the child close and everything was,
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:17.840]   the hills in the background was beautiful.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.480]   Everything was in the right proportion.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.680]   You see, here's the principle.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.680]   Our posture determines our perspective.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.440]   And when we come to a place where we rely on God,
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.080]   we lean in on God,
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.920]   we will find His grace in the wilderness.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.880]   So it says for us in verse 3,
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.840]   "A voice cries in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord.'"
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.520]   How do you prepare the way for the Lord?
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:52.400]   You prepare the way for the Lord by the posture you take in prayer,
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:57.040]   in dependence, in quiet submission to God.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.600]   Because when we do that, here's the fourth good news.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.200]   We can discover God's purpose in the wilderness.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.400]   That God allows seasons of wilderness in our life
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.760]   to teach us things that we otherwise cannot learn
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.880]   apart from that wilderness.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.920]   Ah, but here comes the attack of the lie of the evil one.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.160]   The lie of Satan is he tells us,
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.120]   "There is no way out of the wilderness.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.440]   You are trapped in the wilderness.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.800]   It is hopeless."
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.280]   And we panic.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.320]   We think, "Oh, our marriage is hopeless.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.200]   Or our parenting is hopeless.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.560]   Or our ministry is hopeless.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.240]   Or the church is hopeless.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.760]   Or our job is hopeless.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.200]   Our boss is hopeless.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.960]   Everything around is hopeless."
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.920]   And then we come, "I am hopeless."
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.840]   Because everything is hopeless.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.040]   Don't lose hope.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.520]   Never call hopeless what God has not called hopeless.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.840]   A definition of bondage is when we call hopeless
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.920]   what God has not called hopeless.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.040]   And therefore, in that hopelessness,
[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.440]   we are in bondage.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.280]   God is the bondage breaker.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.200]   With God, there is always hope.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.920]   Prepare the way in the wilderness
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.520]   is when we come to a place of surrender
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:21.560]   and we lean in on the God of hope.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:27.040]   Otherwise, there is no way out of our wilderness.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.000]   It crushes us into despair and discouragement.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.840]   And Satan wins because he intimidates us.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:37.440]   "There is no way you're going to get out of your wilderness.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.360]   It is hopeless."
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.800]   But God tells us,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.760]   "You will find grace in the wilderness."
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.480]   He repeated that prophetic word in Jeremiah 31 verse 2.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.640]   That in the wilderness, you will find grace in it.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:58.400]   Because God doesn't merely lead us to the wilderness.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.560]   He leads us through the wilderness.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.480]   He invites us to a missional intimacy with Him.
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.520]   So what's our response?
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.880]   Let me offer to you some basic fundamentals
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.360]   that we must hold on to as we respond to the Lord.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.280]   Number one is to realise everyone
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.680]   encounters a wilderness season in our life.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   When I was younger, I thought, "Oh, if you're a godly Christian,
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.120]   you will not have a wilderness experience."
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.680]   Until I read the Scripture, it says,
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:33.680]   "The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the wilderness to be tested."
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.000]   I learned that God uses the wilderness for our good.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.840]   The second lesson is that the greatest snare in the wilderness
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.800]   is murmuring and complaining.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:48.240]   And the reason for murmuring and complaining is unbelief.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   What we need to do is to learn to keep a gratitude journal.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.320]   That is why I begin by saying to us,
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.840]   gratitude is so important because God is the one
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:02.680]   who makes straight in the desert a highway for Himself
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.800]   when we walk with faith and gratitude.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.400]   He says, "Every valley shall be lifted up
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   and every mountain and hill shall be made low."
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:16.880]   In other words, God Himself, He will make the path for you.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.480]   So keep a gratitude journal.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.480]   Record God's goodness in your life.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.880]   The third response is to realise we have a choice in the wilderness.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.400]   It is not a time to be crippled by our doubts or anxieties.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.680]   It's a time to anchor in the Word of God and to move on in faith.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.440]   It is to declare the goodness of God.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.760]   Look at verse 6 now.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.320]   It says, "A voice cried and said,
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:50.600]   'What shall I cry?'
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.840]   That is a prophetic declaration of God's Word.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.440]   That is a prophetic voice in the Scripture we must heed.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.840]   That's the fourth response we must learn, that God speaks.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.400]   Through the prophets, He gives us hope.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.240]   So now the prophet Isaiah asked, "What shall I cry?"
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.360]   And the statement is, "All flesh is grass
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.200]   and all the beauty is like the flower of the field.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.000]   The grass withers, the flower fades.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.240]   When the breath of the Lord blows upon it,
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.160]   surely the people are grass.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.960]   The grass withers, the flower fades.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.920]   But the Word of the Lord stands forever."
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:34.600]   Now, this is only the preface of what he's supposed to cry out.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.160]   It is not what Isaiah was to cry out.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.240]   It's the reason given.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.480]   In other words, when the Spirit said, "Cry,"
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.720]   and Isaiah the prophet said, "What shall I cry?"
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.960]   The premise, the reason given is,
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:54.320]   everything else will fade away except the Word of God.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.040]   Meaning, there is nothing worthy to cry out
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.320]   except the Word of God.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:04.680]   So what is the Word of God that Isaiah was supposed to cry out?
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.000]   We find that now in the next verse, verse 9.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.160]   "Go up to a high mountain, O Zion, herald of good news.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:16.000]   Lift up your voice with strength, O Jerusalem,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.120]   herald of good news.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.600]   Lift it up, fear not.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:24.360]   Say to the cities of Judah, 'Behold your God.'"
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.000]   These are the three words the prophet was to cry out,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.560]   even in the wilderness.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.960]   "Behold your God."
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.800]   Whatever difficulty or crisis you are in,
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.400]   "Behold your God."
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.960]   Whatever challenges you face, "Behold your God."
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.480]   Whatever problems come your way, "Behold your God."
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:49.000]   Whatever darkness there is in your life, "Behold your God."
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.400]   That's the prophetic word.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.120]   That's the key.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.840]   "Behold your God."
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.720]   When we understand this key,
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:04.120]   gratitude flows out of our heart.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.480]   Because we have a loving Father.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.800]   Because we have a Father who cares for us.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.000]   Jesus said, "If you being evil know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.160]   how much more does the heavenly Father give good gifts
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.920]   to those who are called His children?"
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.600]   We are the children of God.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.040]   He wants to bless us with His favour and His grace.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.920]   But He calls us to understand we are not to behold the world.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.920]   We are not to behold its glamour and splendour and deceptions and illusions
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:44.560]   and get all confused by what is the trappings of success,
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.040]   or the symbols of success, or the tokens of success.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:54.760]   God wants us to be truly successful when we behold our God.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:00.040]   Oh, we need a radical definition of success in our life.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:06.040]   Success is not when everything is up in the mountain and celebrative and high.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.760]   Success is even when we are in the valley.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.640]   Even when wilderness sets in.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:18.120]   Even when we cry tears nobody knows, nobody sees but God.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:24.080]   Even in those valleys, God is there with us.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.760]   And when we lay hold of Him,
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.960]   that's true success.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.920]   Because when we lay hold of Him,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:40.640]   there will be a profound sense of gratitude when we behold Him.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:43.440]   I think at the end of the day,
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:49.120]   there is always hope when we lay hold of God.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.080]   But we must be willing to come out of our comfort zone,
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.200]   to follow the Lord's leading, to lean in on God.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.520]   My time has caught up with me. I want to close with a true story.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.120]   Many years ago, I was in Malaysia preaching with a group of Singaporean pastors.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.120]   They rented a big auditorium and several churches gathered there.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.120]   We took turns to preach that night. My friend was preaching.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.120]   I was sitting in front listening to him and the Lord spoke to me,
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.440]   "Son, go behind."
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.000]   I went behind and I thought, "Wow, this is a great vantage point."
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.120]   I could see my friend preaching.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.000]   I see the churches gathered. I could pray for them.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.640]   And that's what I did. While I was praying,
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.400]   the Holy Spirit fell upon me and gave me a simple word that shocked me.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.320]   "Son, dance."
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.440]   Edmund Chan don't do dance.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.200]   I am an evangelical, son of a non-dancing evangelical.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.080]   Even if I want to dance, I don't know how to dance.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.680]   But I did tell the Lord before,
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.040]   "Lord, whatever you say to me, confirm it by your word."
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.280]   And the word of the Lord came.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.800]   David danced before the Lord.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.840]   "Son, it's alright to dance."
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.120]   I was thinking, "But David is a Jew. I'm a Chinese Singaporean.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.000]   The Jews dance all the time.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.960]   My African brothers and sisters dance all the time.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.840]   I'm a conservative Chinese Singaporean pastor.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.640]   I don't do dance."
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:14.120]   But I did not argue with the Lord.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.120]   So what do I do?
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:22.320]   I twirl around and dance the worst dance in the history of the Christian church.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.120]   As I obeyed the Lord and worshipped Him and danced around,
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.440]   imagining how David would dance as he celebrated the Lord,
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.760]   suddenly the word of the Lord came to me.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.640]   There's a woman, she's dressed in yellow.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.560]   Her husband has just slapped her. Her heart is broken.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.280]   Go to her and say three things.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.120]   "I, the Lord, I'm your husband. I love you. I take care of you."
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.360]   I opened my eyes at the shock of my life.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:50.040]   For some reason that night, there were so many women dressed in yellow.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.560]   Can you imagine going to the wrong one?
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.120]   Your husband has just left you.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.440]   "No, I'm not married."
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:56.080]   Your future husband.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.840]   "I can't say that."
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.320]   Or your husband has just left you.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.720]   "No, my husband is here."
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:01.880]   And she turned to her husband.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.880]   "Are you thinking of leaving me?
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:07.160]   I cannot be party to domestic violence."
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.200]   So which one?
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.800]   By the time the service was over,
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.240]   I walked in the center aisle, looking left and right.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.000]   So many women dressed in yellow.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   "Lord, which one?"
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.320]   And the Lord spoke to me.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.680]   "Son, I am not a God of confusion
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.960]   to show you that I've spoken to you.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.160]   Your wife is already speaking to her."
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.080]   Whoa, faith rose in my heart.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:30.960]   I walked to the front.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.360]   I saw Anne speaking, the woman dressed in yellow.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.200]   Anne was speaking.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.640]   I stopped her and said, "Anne, can I speak to this lady?"
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.160]   I turned to her and said, "I want to tell you three things.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.400]   Your husband has left you, but this is what the Lord says.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.200]   Three things."
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.720]   He said, "I, the Lord, I'm your husband.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.920]   I love you. I will take care of you."
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.840]   She began to cry.
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.400]   "It must be God.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.480]   He takes a stranger who knows nothing about my deepest pain
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.800]   to tell me about the grace and the love of God."
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.040]   As she started to cry, Anne and I laid hands on her,
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.080]   prayed for her.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.880]   I wish I have a video recorder
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.560]   to record the change in countenance.
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.920]   At first, there was sadness,
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.360]   and suddenly there was a glow,
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.600]   and there was a joy and a peace of the Lord that came.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.840]   That night in the hotel room, Anne kept asking me,
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.040]   "How do you know? How do you know?"
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.600]   I said, "I dance."
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.280]   You know it's not the dancing.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:26.680]   It is the willingness to lean in on God, to depend on God.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:29.000]   I am not suggesting you do anything
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.400]   you think God is telling you to do.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.960]   Remember what I said.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.720]   I said, "Lord, whatever you tell me to do,
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.240]   you confirm through the Scriptures.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.200]   And when you confirm through the Scriptures, I will obey."
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:47.360]   When the Lord helps us in our wilderness
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.520]   to lean in on Him, to depend upon Him,
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.120]   to embrace these three prophetic words in Isaiah,
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.120]   "Behold your God!"
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.560]   You know what comes up in my heart
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.760]   every time I behold God?
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.040]   Gratitude.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:06.440]   And that gratitude changes everything,
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.080]   even in my wilderness.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.800]   Would you bow with me in prayer?
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.560]   Heavenly Father, when You tell us,
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.160]   "Prepare your heart,
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.120]   prepare the way of the Lord in the wilderness,"
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.440]   You are calling us to prepare our heart
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.120]   to lean in upon You,
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:26.040]   whatever may befall,
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.160]   because You are there in our wilderness.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.400]   Your presence, Your provision,
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   Your power may manifest.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.640]   So help us, dear God, in this journey,
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:41.160]   in this pilgrimage of discipleship,
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:44.080]   that even in the wilderness,
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.680]   when we behold our God,
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:51.440]   there is victory and an overcoming faith.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.720]   We thank You in Jesus' wonderful name.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.720]   Amen.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:05.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
