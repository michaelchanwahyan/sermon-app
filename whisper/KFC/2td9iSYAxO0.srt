1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - And it's great to be here in the midst of what's happening

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,540
 and just to be able to preach God's word.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,660
 And as Michelle said, we're continuing our series

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,520
 in Judges when everyone did as they saw fit.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,320
 And so far, John took us through an introduction

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,860
 in the first sermon on chapter one and two,

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,840
 just an overview of Judges.

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,500
 And then Pastor James gave us a sermon

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,300
 on Ehud and Shemgar.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,660
 And last week, we went through Deborah

11
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,940
 as Pastor Michelle took us through that.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,440
 And today we are going through Gideon,

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,780
 the farmer who struggled to obey God.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,080
 And so we're gonna start in chapter six of Judges.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,900
 And it says this,

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,020
 "The Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord.

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,740
 And for seven years,

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,500
 he gave them into the hands of the Midianites.

19
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,500
 Because the power of the Midians was so oppressive,

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,940
 the Israelites prepared shelters for themselves

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,700
 in mountain cluffs, caves, and strongholds."

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,820
 And so we see in the book of Judges,

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,540
 this pattern of Israel sinning,

24
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,140
 going to the idols of their neighbors,

25
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,060
 doing things that God was not happy about.

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,140
 And what happened was that God would send people

27
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,780
 to oppress them, to punish them.

28
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,940
 And once they're, you know,

29
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,460
 got to a certain point where punishment got so strong,

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,460
 Israelites would cry out to the Lord,

31
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,620
 "God, help us in this.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,060
 We're so, you know,

33
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,320
 oppressed by these different enemies that you've sent us."

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,160
 What would they do?

35
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,220
 They would turn back to God in repentance.

36
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,180
 And then what would happen after that

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,580
 is God would deliver them.

38
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,220
 They would send judges, right?

39
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,120
 Just like Deborah, Ehud, and others.

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,460
 Today, we're gonna see Gideon,

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,820
 and there would be a time of peace.

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,180
 There would be a time of peace.

43
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,580
 And so between Deborah and now,

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,180
 there's been a time of peace,

45
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,260
 but then Israel went back into the cycle.

46
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,160
 And it says that the Midianites were sent

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,500
 to oppress Israel.

48
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,980
 And it describes Israel as locusts, right?

49
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:25,860
 And I know locusts have been on the news this year, 2020.

50
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,180
 Wow, we've had viruses, we've had fires,

51
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,860
 we had rumors of wars.

52
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,780
 We've had locusts, right,

53
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,720
 that have started from Africa,

54
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,120
 that moved to the Middle East.

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,260
 And we think it's like in South America now,

56
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,100
 and something like that.

57
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,580
 Locusts have been eating up all the crops.

58
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,340
 And so they describe,

59
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,940
 the Bible here describes the Midianites as locusts.

60
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,940
 They would come in and eat all of your food.

61
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,460
 Yes, all your food, all your goodies.

62
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,140
 They're gonna eat all your goodies, right?

63
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,140
 And it's sort of like when UN declares economic sanctions

64
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,580
 on certain nations that have done corrupt things, right?

65
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,540
 They want to sort of take away their economic power

66
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,540
 because of their corruption.

67
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,540
 And that is sort of the strategy

68
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,220
 that the Midianites used against Israel.

69
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,220
 They took away the crops, they took away their goodies,

70
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,140
 they took away their livestock.

71
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,220
 And the Israelites then cried out to the Lord,

72
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,660
 "God, help us."

73
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,140
 And God sent a prophet to tell them

74
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,820
 that just as I have saved you from Egypt,

75
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,780
 I will send a deliverer as well to save you.

76
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,020
 And so we start in verse 11.

77
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,940
 There's a change of events in verse 11.

78
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,420
 "The angel of the Lord came and sat down

79
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,740
 under the oak in Opera that belonged to Joash,

80
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,940
 where his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a wine press

81
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,140
 to keep it from the Midianites.

82
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,060
 When the angel of the Lord appeared to Gideon,

83
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,860
 he said, 'The Lord is with you, mighty warrior,

84
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,340
 mighty warrior.'"

85
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,020
 So I don't know if anybody's been to a wine press before.

86
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,180
 Anybody stepped on grapes on a wine press,

87
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,620
 got their feet all purple and red?

88
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,020
 Yeah, anybody?

89
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,620
 No, okay.

90
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,820
 Well, back then, I think this might've been,

91
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,780
 I don't know exactly,

92
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,420
 but this might've been a wine press.

93
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,300
 That's where you step on grapes and you try to make wine

94
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,900
 and it hopefully comes fermented.

95
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,100
 And so what was Gideon doing?

96
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,460
 Gideon wasn't making wine, was he?

97
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,100
 No, he was threshing wheat.

98
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,300
 And so what they usually did in the olden days

99
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,260
 was they went to a wide open space,

100
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,060
 they would throw wheat in the air,

101
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,620
 and hopefully the wind would separate

102
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,980
 the wheat from the chaff, right?

103
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,860
 But Gideon wasn't doing that in a wine press, right?

104
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,420
 I mean, Gideon wasn't making wine in a wine press.

105
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,660
 He was threshing wheat.

106
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,980
 And why was he doing that?

107
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,100
 We know that he was hiding.

108
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,340
 He was afraid.

109
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,900
 And it's interesting because the angel of the Lord

110
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,900
 says this, ironically, "Mighty warrior," right?

111
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,660
 For somebody who's hiding in a wine press, threshing wheat,

112
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,820
 trying to not get caught by the media knights,

113
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,300
 an angel of the Lord says, ironically,

114
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,460
 that he would be a mighty warrior,

115
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,900
 or he calls him a mighty warrior.

116
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,900
 And chapter six in Judges is a story

117
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,700
 of the character development of Gideon,

118
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,700
 how he grows from a doubter to a believer,

119
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,580
 and then from a believer to a warrior of God,

120
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,740
 from a doubter to a believer,

121
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,380
 from a believer to the warrior of God.

122
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,380
 And so we see that this conversation continues.

123
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,380
 In verse 10, or verse 13, Gideon says,

124
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,700
 "Pardon me, Lord, but if the Lord is with us,

125
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,780
 "why has all this happened to us?

126
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,540
 "Where are all the wonders

127
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,860
 "that our ancestor told us about?"

128
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,700
 Right?

129
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,700
 And so Gideon here doubts that God is with Israel.

130
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,340
 And then he doubts that God can do these wonders, right?

131
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,660
 Where is this wondrous God who saved Israel?

132
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,660
 And he also questions that God has abandoned them, right?

133
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,220
 He says, "But now the Lord has abandoned us

134
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,980
 "and given us into the hands of the Medianites."

135
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,980
 We see here that Gideon is doubting, doubts God,

136
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,660
 doubts the wonders of God,

137
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,380
 and doubts that God is with them,

138
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,220
 and that God has in fact abandoned them.

139
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,660
 And so what is this conversation?

140
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,140
 How does it go?

141
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,240
 Well, the Lord responds and says,

142
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,740
 "Go in the strength you have

143
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,520
 "and save Israel out of Median's hands.

144
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,900
 "Am I not sending you?"

145
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,900
 God tells him that he will go in the strength.

146
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,740
 He should go in the strength that he has.

147
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,460
 And in a sense, God is meeting Gideon where he's at.

148
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,820
 God tells him to go and save Israel

149
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,980
 through his own strength,

150
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,580
 through the strength that he's been given.

151
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,540
 In a sense, God is commissioning him to go.

152
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:48,540
 And so we see here that God responds firstly

153
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:53,740
 with reassurance that Gideon has what he needs

154
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,260
 to go and defeat the Medianites.

155
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,140
 And so God doesn't tell Gideon to do the impossible.

156
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:06,340
 God tells him to go in the strength he has

157
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,940
 and to trust him with the impossible.

158
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,540
 And God also tells us to do similar things,

159
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,280
 that we aren't supposed to do the impossible.

160
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,680
 The impossible is for God.

161
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,540
 And God only wants us to do the things that we can

162
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,480
 and trust him with the impossible.

163
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,280
 And so this conversation continues.

164
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 It's sort of like Moses and God at the burning bush.

165
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,880
 He's making all sorts of excuses.

166
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,160
 And then Gideon continues, "Pardon me, Lord,

167
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,460
 "but can I save Israel?

168
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,460
 "My clan is the weakest and I'm the least of my family."

169
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,360
 He's making excuse after excuse.

170
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,960
 My clan is the weakest, I'm the weakest of my family.

171
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,820
 It's like saying, "I can't play basketball.

172
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,560
 "I'm the shortest person."

173
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,760
 And, "I'm," nevermind.

174
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,920
 I'm (laughs)

175
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,240
 And so how does the Lord respond to this, another excuse?

176
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,060
 The Lord says, "I will be with you."

177
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,640
 He reassures Gideon, "I will be with you.

178
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,560
 "And you will strike down all the Medians,

179
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,860
 "leaving none alive."

180
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,520
 God reassures him once again.

181
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,200
 And yet Gideon is still not convinced.

182
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,880
 Amazing, right?

183
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,560
 So what does he say in verse 17?

184
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,460
 "If now I have found favor in your eyes,

185
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,960
 "give me a sign that it is really you talking to me."

186
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,780
 Gideon is thinking, "Oh, he must be in a wine press.

187
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,300
 "He might have like breathe in all the alcohol

188
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,020
 "or something, I don't know, from the wine press.

189
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,020
 "I don't know how it works.

190
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,800
 "Maybe he thought he was hallucinating, right?

191
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,660
 "Like God, give me a sign.

192
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,840
 "I'm still not sure.

193
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,380
 "Please do not go away until I come back

194
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,160
 "and give you an offering."

195
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,880
 And the Lord responded once again and says,

196
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,920
 "I will wait until you return."

197
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,920
 And so we see here through this conversation

198
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,720
 that Gideon is a doubter.

199
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,640
 He doubts God's favor with Israel.

200
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,840
 He doubts his own ability.

201
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,520
 I'm the least of my clan.

202
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,360
 My clan is the least of Israel.

203
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,680
 I can't do this, right?

204
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,680
 And he also doubts God's word and affirmation

205
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,440
 that he would be with him

206
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,960
 and in fact is now testing God.

207
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:46,200
 I remember when I was young and in high school,

208
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,700
 which was not so far long ago, obviously,

209
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:54,420
 that I was called to be one of the group leaders

210
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,960
 of my high school fellowship, right?

211
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,300
 Of my high school fellowship.

212
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,940
 And I thought, "Yeah, this is cool.

213
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,300
 "I get to lead.

214
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,000
 "People are gonna look up to me.

215
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,180
 "It's gonna be awesome."

216
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,780
 And then I started leading.

217
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,900
 And then these people, you know how it is, right?

218
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,260
 Sometimes with your peers, right?

219
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,060
 In Chinese churches, they don't talk much.

220
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,140
 They're very silent.

221
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,780
 It's like picking brains, not picking brains.

222
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,300
 I don't know, pulling teeth.

223
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,540
 Sorry, not picking brains, pulling teeth.

224
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,740
 (laughs)

225
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,240
 No picking brains allowed in KFC.

226
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,700
 It's like pulling teeth, right?

227
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,520
 Trying to get these peers, these teens,

228
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,660
 to talk about anything, right?

229
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,320
 And so they started complaining.

230
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,220
 And all of a sudden, I start going from,

231
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,420
 "Oh, I really wanna be a cell group leader,"

232
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,860
 to, "I don't wanna do this," right?

233
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,700
 Like people just complain.

234
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,680
 "I don't think I can do it.

235
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,220
 "I don't think people are listening.

236
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,520
 "I'm doubting myself.

237
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,140
 "I'm doubting why God has called me to this.

238
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,260
 "I am doubting."

239
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,200
 And I think we've all sort of been

240
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,140
 in those similar situations before, right?

241
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,300
 Whether God has called us to be a pianist,

242
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,300
 to be a pastor, to be a husband, to be a father,

243
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,460
 God calls us to these things.

244
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,660
 And sometimes we start doubting our own abilities.

245
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,780
 We start doubting God.

246
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,840
 We start doubting whether we're in the right situation.

247
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,420
 But the story of Gideon does not stop there, right?

248
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,860
 He doesn't stop at being a doubter.

249
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,540
 He continues from doubter to believer

250
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,420
 and from believer to a warrior.

251
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,060
 And so we're gonna see this process of becoming a believer.

252
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,140
 And so the first test we see that Gideon gives to God,

253
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,260
 "God, let me know that you're real

254
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,060
 "and I'm not just hallucinating."

255
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,700
 The first thing he did was he cooked some meat and bread,

256
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,400
 and made some bread, and he gave it back to the angel.

257
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,160
 And the angel said, "Take it out of the pot

258
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,740
 "and put it on the stone."

259
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,160
 And the angel touched it.

260
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,140
 And what happened?

261
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,040
 It burned.

262
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,980
 It burned.

263
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,820
 And right at that instant, Gideon believed.

264
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,800
 Gideon believed that it was God.

265
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,980
 And so he became a believer at that moment.

266
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,480
 And what happens?

267
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,940
 God prepares those he calls.

268
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,720
 God prepares those that he calls, and he equips them.

269
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,340
 And so the first preparation that Gideon was assigned

270
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,140
 was to go and destroy the idols

271
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,060
 that were in his neighborhood.

272
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,900
 God assigns him to go destroy Baal's statue

273
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,580
 and the Asherah, Paul.

274
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,100
 And so we have a photo of it, the next slide.

275
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,740
 This might've been what it looked like back then,

276
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,900
 these sort of different idols that were in the nation

277
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,500
 of Israel and in Gideon's neighborhood.

278
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,860
 And so what does Gideon do?

279
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,420
 He waits till nightfall, right?

280
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,020
 It's like "Mission Impossible."

281
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,580
 ♪ Da da da da ♪

282
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,780
 Oh no, that's James Bond.

283
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,300
 I'm singing the wrong tune.

284
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,900
 Just testing you guys, right?

285
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,060
 (laughs)

286
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,140
 And so he does a little secret "Mission Impossible,"

287
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,940
 and he takes out 10 guys, right?

288
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,180
 Usually Tom Cruise only has like four or five, right?

289
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,180
 He's a small crew.

290
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,320
 But Gideon, this is a big job, right?

291
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,940
 These are big idols.

292
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,260
 And so he takes 10 people.

293
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,620
 And what does he do?

294
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,660
 He takes away, he pulls down the idol, Baal's idol,

295
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,100
 and then he uses the wood of Asherah

296
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,140
 as an altar for the Lord.

297
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,580
 And then next morning, all the neighborhood wakes up

298
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,980
 and is like, "Who did this?

299
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,180
 Who did this?"

300
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:58,900
 And they're like, "It's Gideon."

301
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,900
 And Gideon's dad actually stood up for him, right?

302
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,220
 He's like, "If my son,"

303
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,940
 not that he's from Texas or anything,

304
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,060
 "But if my son did this,

305
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,960
 then Baal will take his own revenge," right?

306
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,460
 So that was preparation number one.

307
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,020
 That was preparation number one,

308
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,540
 mission impossible number one.

309
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,420
 Go and destroy, rid your neighborhood of the idols.

310
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,260
 And then the second thing God tells him to do

311
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,260
 is to go and assemble the people of Israel

312
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,860
 for battle against the Midianites and the Malachites.

313
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,240
 And so he does that,

314
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,400
 and he assembles the people throughout the nations, right?

315
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,140
 Not throughout the nations, throughout the tribes of Israel.

316
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,860
 And before they go into battle,

317
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,860
 once again, Gideon needs reassurance, right?

318
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,040
 Who's asked God for reassurance before?

319
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,820
 Before a major decision?

320
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,460
 Yeah, coming to Hong Kong, right?

321
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,580
 All three of these pastors.

322
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,700
 We needed assurance that this was the place

323
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,980
 that God has called us.

324
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,900
 And so let me read in verse 36 here.

325
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,020
 God said to Gideon,

326
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,260
 "If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have promised,

327
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,440
 look, I will place a wool fleece on the fleshing floor.

328
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,920
 If there is dew only on the fleece

329
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,100
 and all the ground is dry,

330
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,300
 then I will know that you will save Israel by my hand,

331
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,220
 as you have said."

332
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,300
 And that is what happened.

333
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,340
 Gideon rose up the next day,

334
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,100
 he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew,

335
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,800
 a bowl full of water.

336
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,780
 And so you would think, oh yeah, you know,

337
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:57,500
 one test, one assurance from God is enough.

338
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,140
 But no, Gideon wants more.

339
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,500
 You know, he's very unsure.

340
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,660
 Verse 39, Gideon said to the Lord again,

341
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,180
 "Don't be angry with me.

342
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,500
 Let me just make one more request.

343
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,720
 Allow me to do one more test with the fleece."

344
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,060
 And this time it was the reverse, right?

345
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,820
 That the whole ground, the whole fleshing floor would be wet

346
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,380
 and the fleece would be dry.

347
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,340
 And yet God met him where he was once again.

348
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,420
 That night, God did so.

349
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,660
 God did so.

350
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,660
 And so we see this process of Gideon from a doubter,

351
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,260
 doubting whether God was with Israel,

352
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,580
 doubting himself to becoming a believer,

353
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,180
 being assured that God is real

354
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,300
 and that God is who he says he is.

355
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:55,060
 And then God preparing Gideon through a series of things,

356
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,580
 through a series of missions and preparations,

357
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,220
 ridding his neighborhood of idols

358
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,960
 and then assembling the tribes

359
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,120
 and some of the people towards battle.

360
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,040
 And so we see this process from a hiding farmer

361
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,220
 to a mighty warrior, a hiding farmer to a mighty warrior.

362
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:26,660
 And there are many examples throughout the Bible.

363
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,260
 We see King David, a small shepherd boy, right?

364
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:37,640
 To become a process of becoming a warrior for God.

365
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,660
 How did God prepare him?

366
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,060
 He was a shepherd.

367
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,220
 He had to take on bears and lions

368
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,260
 that came to snatch away the sheep.

369
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:52,260
 And God used those as tests and trials and preparation

370
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,020
 for him to meet Goliath on that day.

371
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,980
 And not only from a shepherd boy to a warrior,

372
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,920
 but then from a warrior to a king, right?

373
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,740
 There were many times he was struggling against Saul,

374
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,860
 fighting against Saul.

375
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,860
 And God prepared him in those lonely places to become king.

376
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,180
 And I can speak of my own experience.

377
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,960
 When I was 14, I was a pastor's kid, pastor's kid.

378
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,420
 You love it, I know.

379
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,820
 I know, Reuben.

380
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,380
 And 14, I was in a summer camp

381
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,640
 and we usually have three dedication night altar calls.

382
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,020
 The first is to come to a relationship with Christ.

383
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,300
 The second is to live for Christ.

384
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,260
 And the third one was to serve God full-time.

385
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,820
 And I remember that night,

386
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,220
 I was so moved by the Holy Spirit

387
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,060
 that Jesus had given up everything for us.

388
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,460
 What was my response?

389
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:00,140
 My response is, it's a no-brainer.

390
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,540
 I got to give up everything for him.

391
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:07,260
 And so if God was calling me to full-time service

392
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,340
 and to serve him as a pastor or a missionary,

393
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,820
 I would be willing to go.

394
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,140
 And of course, at that time, I was 14, right?

395
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,300
 Which was not too long ago, obviously.

396
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:23,220
 I had my own doubts.

397
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,460
 I didn't know.

398
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,900
 And God used being a soul group leader.

399
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,900
 God used being a worship praise band leader,

400
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:38,180
 these kind of steps to prepare me for who I am today.

401
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,500
 And God used seminary to equip me in my knowledge

402
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,340
 and understanding of the word of God

403
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,460
 so that I could become who I am today.

404
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,580
 And so we always see that throughout this process,

405
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,220
 there is a calling.

406
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,700
 God calls us always from something to something.

407
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,220
 We go through sometimes periods of doubting.

408
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,940
 Maybe sometimes it's longer for some and others,

409
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,540
 it's quicker.

410
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,140
 And then we start to believe, it's believing.

411
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,620
 Yes, that God, you are true, that yes, God,

412
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,080
 you have called me.

413
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,180
 And then next, we start to rise up.

414
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,320
 Even though we're not fully assured that we could do it,

415
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,820
 we start to trust God with the things we cannot control.

416
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,100
 And we take hold of God's calling in our life.

417
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,740
 And this process, as you see on the screen, it continues.

418
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,420
 There's new callings that come up all the time.

419
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,680
 New callings that come up all the time.

420
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,620
 David from shepherd boy to warrior, from warrior to king.

421
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,620
 Johnny from pastor's kid to going to seminary

422
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:59,460
 and from seminary to Hong Kong and to Hong Kong

423
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,940
 to becoming a pastor.

424
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,820
 It's a process.

425
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,680
 God is always calling us from something to something.

426
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:15,120
 And so where is God calling you today?

427
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,260
 Here are some steps that I think that will help us

428
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,020
 to go from doubters to believers

429
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,880
 to warriors and servants of Christ.

430
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,800
 Number one, realize your calling.

431
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,260
 Realize your calling.

432
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,100
 You can't go anywhere if you don't know

433
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,660
 where you're being called to, right?

434
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,260
 It's a no-brainer.

435
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,100
 Now, there are general callings in the Bible, right?

436
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,340
 Great commission, go and make disciples.

437
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,360
 We've been all called to go and make disciples

438
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,140
 of all nations, right?

439
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,980
 We've been all called to be a kingdom of priests.

440
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,740
 Sometimes God gives us specific callings

441
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,640
 to go and do mission work or to be pastoring.

442
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,240
 Sometimes God tells us to use our vocation,

443
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,980
 our work to serve him.

444
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,360
 Where has God called you?

445
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,520
 The second thing is understand your doubts.

446
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,440
 Sometimes we doubt, right?

447
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,320
 It's natural, it's human.

448
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,880
 Gideon doubted, I've doubted, James has doubted, right?

449
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,920
 He's talked about it, coming to Hong Kong,

450
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,240
 you know, his family, bringing his whole family.

451
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,980
 It's a tough decision.

452
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,440
 Understand your doubts.

453
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,680
 And then what I really appreciate from Gideon

454
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,840
 is he was just honest before God.

455
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,540
 He was honest.

456
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,560
 Tell God your worries.

457
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,400
 Tell God some of the things that you're struggling through.

458
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,480
 Maybe not make excuse after excuse like him,

459
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,400
 but tell him the things that you're going through.

460
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,120
 And then next, ask for his confirmation, right?

461
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,640
 God will speak to you.

462
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,480
 I believe God will speak to you personally

463
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,920
 through his word as you seek him.

464
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:10,640
 Sometimes we need spiritual counsel to advise us,

465
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,600
 is this the right decision?

466
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,240
 You know, coming to Hong Kong,

467
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,200
 I had to ask some of my best friends,

468
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,240
 my family, my parents, and they all advised me

469
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,800
 that this was a great opportunity

470
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,560
 and that God was opening doors.

471
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,840
 And as he opened doors, it was a confirmation

472
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,880
 that I should come.

473
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,800
 And then the next thing is we need to rise up in faith,

474
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,960
 rise up to the calling that God has called you to.

475
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,480
 There may be doubts that you have of yourself,

476
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,560
 but in your weaknesses, we must trust God

477
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,240
 with the things we can't control.

478
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,840
 God's not asking you to do the impossible.

479
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,440
 He's asking you to go in the strength that you have

480
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,400
 and trust him to do the impossible.

481
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,900
 I'm gonna invite the band to come up as we finish.

482
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,000
 And so I wanna conclude with this question.

483
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,440
 This is you.

484
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:16,380
 Where is God calling you?

485
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:24,080
 He's calling you from something to something.

486
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,360
 Maybe you're a student in high school.

487
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,600
 God, you know, you're asking God,

488
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,400
 "God, where should I go for university?

489
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,920
 "I'm not sure."

490
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,680
 God is calling you from a place to another place.

491
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,120
 Maybe you're working, right?

492
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:44,400
 And God is like, God wants you to serve more

493
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,480
 or spend more time in certain area.

494
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,740
 Maybe it's at church, maybe it's at family, to serve him.

495
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,920
 Where is God calling you?

496
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,880
 Whatever life stage you're at,

497
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,760
 God is calling you from wherever you are

498
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,880
 to become a servant of God, a servant of God.

499
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,760
 Let me pray for us as we finish.

500
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,420
 Heavenly Father, we thank you for the story of Gideon.

501
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,700
 We thank you that even though he had his doubts,

502
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,580
 that God, you assured him of your presence in his life.

503
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,400
 You assured him that you would be with him

504
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,860
 and that he would defeat the Midianites

505
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,020
 because of your power.

506
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,200
 And so God, we don't need to do the impossible.

507
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,080
 We just need to trust you,

508
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,720
 that you have given us the strength to do it

509
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,340
 and that we need to go in the strength that we have

510
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,740
 and trust you with the things we cannot control.

511
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,180
 And so God, I'll pray for every person

512
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,420
 that is watching right now,

513
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,020
 that God, you would speak to them personally,

514
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,060
 tell them where their calling is

515
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:15,460
 and where you want to lead them.

516
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,000
 And I pray that each one of you would rise up in faith

517
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,240
 just as Gideon did

518
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,900
 to become a servant of God.

519
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,560
 Bless you.

520
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,640
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

521
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,140
 (piano music)
