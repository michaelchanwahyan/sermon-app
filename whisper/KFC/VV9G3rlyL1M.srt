1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 It's great to be here.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,740
 Good evening, and I'm very happy that we're continuing on the book of Ecclesiastes.

3
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,600
 We are on chapter four.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,500
 Now today's topic, oh, I forgot to, I can take this off.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,120
 So today's topic is life just isn't fair.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,000
 I don't think any of us is unfamiliar with it.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,440
 I mean, I can start off with something easy, like, you know, you go to a restaurant and

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,440
 what do you do?

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,760
 You order a plate of, let's say, spaghetti, right?

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,960
 So the waiter brings it on, but you know, he usually holds two of the same thing coming

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,520
 up because someone else also ordered it, right?

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,520
 So what do they do?

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,200
 They put down one on your table, and before you know it, you look at it, you're like,

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,840
 why is this a smaller portion than the other one that's just about to go to the other table,

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,840
 right?

16
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,760
 And the meat, it's all in that other plate.

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,000
 Life just isn't fair.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,760
 And so you go and you want to pay for your groceries, right?

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
 What do you do?

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,000
 There are four lines.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,240
 So you try your best to pick the one that would go the fastest, right?

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,600
 So you stay there, and all you see are the other three that's going, and you're the one

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,760
 that's stuck in the line that's not, because the person in front had an issue with the

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,880
 credit card.

25
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,480
 The barcode wouldn't go right.

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,720
 Life just isn't fair.

27
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,920
 I mean, how is it possible that we get everything kind of measured out exactly the same for

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,720
 all of us, right?

29
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,760
 Now today in Ecclesiastes chapter four, we see the preacher actually observing four things,

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,400
 three things that are unfair and futile.

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,000
 I mean, the first is where he tells us he sees oppression.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,360
 Those who are in power oppressing those who don't have any.

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,680
 Now that is unfair.

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,320
 And then the second thing that we'll be looking at is those who work hard, because you want

35
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,240
 to work hard, right?

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,200
 And yet they're not fulfilled because all that's in their heart is envy, because there's

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,720
 never enough.

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,200
 Or those who have decided, you know what?

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
 Why bother?

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,400
 I'm just not going to do anything.

41
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,360
 And those people also are unsatisfied because when they don't do anything, they don't have

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
 enough.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,000
 So what we see is work is unfair because you don't get to be satisfied anyways.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,520
 And then the third thing that we're going to look at is where when we achieve power

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:46,800
 or when we gain a lot of money, at the end of the day, we just die and no one remembers

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
 that.

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,240
 That's the point.

48
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,800
 And that's also unfair.

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,960
 So we're going to look at all those who are like, "Wow, this is a very depressing chapter.

50
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,760
 So how should we live our life?"

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,560
 Well, the preacher actually gives us some hints.

52
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,160
 So we're going to look at that together.

53
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,800
 So let's have a look at verse one to three of this chapter.

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,160
 So it says, "Again," the preacher says, "I saw all the oppressions that are done under

55
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,240
 the sun.

56
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,560
 And behold the tears of the oppressed, and they had no one to comfort them.

57
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,380
 On the side of the oppressors, there was power, and then there was no one to comfort them."

58
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,240
 You might think to yourself, why is it that oppressors need to be comforted?

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,040
 This is not talking, the them here is not talking about the oppressors.

60
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,800
 But in an NLT version, maybe it'll help us.

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,420
 It's saying that the oppressors have great power and their victims are helpless.

62
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,080
 So the them was also referring to those who are being oppressed.

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,640
 So how badly was the oppression?

64
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,600
 Well in verse two and three, it tells us that the preacher says, "And I thought that the

65
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:57,280
 dead, those who are dead, are more fortunate than those who are living.

66
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,200
 But better than both is he who had not yet been born and has not yet seen the evil deeds

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,680
 that are done under the sun."

68
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,680
 I guess for all of us here, I think baby's the only one that qualifies for this one.

69
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,280
 Not yet been born.

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,840
 So we see when oppression sometimes gets so bad that we have this saying that, "Oh, I

71
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,600
 wish I was dead," or, "I wish I was never born."

72
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,520
 And that's how bad it gets.

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,440
 And we see that a lot in the Bible, right?

74
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,480
 When the king oppressed the peasants, or when the master oppressed the servant, or the more

75
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,720
 affluent people with power oppressed those who don't have it.

76
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,880
 And Jesus himself was oppressed by the Jewish leaders and the Roman authorities, right?

77
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,080
 So oppression is nothing new to us.

78
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,760
 Now I hope none of you, none of us, are experiencing oppression to that degree.

79
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,360
 Please come talk to us if you are.

80
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,760
 Let us try to do something about it.

81
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,920
 But I mean, we do to some degree or not, are oppressed.

82
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,000
 Either by our boss or our coworkers.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,840
 They might mistreat us.

84
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,640
 Or you might be in a relationship where it's unloving, or you feel that you're disrespected.

85
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,960
 And so somehow you still feel that you're being treated unfairly.

86
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,520
 Now the word here, what's worse though?

87
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,240
 I mean, it's bad enough to have oppression, but what's worse is that there's no one to

88
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,580
 comfort, okay?

89
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,920
 And the tears will come down.

90
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,760
 Can you imagine that in your life when you're going through oppression, that you don't have

91
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,240
 anybody?

92
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,520
 No one understands.

93
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,720
 When you tell them, they might even tell you you're wrong.

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,480
 And you're like, "Oh my goodness, this is even worse."

95
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:56,360
 But we do have this one person who is our ultimate comforter, and that is God.

96
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,440
 So this brings us to our first point.

97
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,240
 When we are oppressed by other, maybe even to the point of death, we need to find comfort

98
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,680
 in God.

99
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,200
 Now when someone treats us really badly, we get angry.

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,120
 And most of the time I think of a picture in my mind that helps me, let's put that up.

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,920
 That's right.

102
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,040
 That's what I think about.

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,320
 I'm like, "I am strangling you in my mind."

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,240
 And somehow I find a little bit of a comfort, right?

105
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,800
 Maybe not you guys, but for me.

106
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,680
 But it's not long lasting.

107
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,500
 And you know what?

108
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,100
 Nothing changes, right?

109
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,160
 I mean, after a few moments of this, I go back to being upset or angry.

110
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,200
 So unless we go to God who's going to give us the peace, when we're actually going through

111
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:49,160
 these oppressions, we're not going to really have comfort.

112
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,880
 And comfort not only means this feeling nice, like somebody understands, but meaning somebody

113
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,200
 actually comes to your rescue and to your help.

114
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,180
 And God is the only one who can do that.

115
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,360
 Now I would like to share with you an example of where I have great oppression, but I realize

116
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,160
 I either don't have one, which thank God, I'm not asking for one.

117
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,840
 Or if I say it, I might expose that person, but that person's not here.

118
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,360
 And it's not anybody you know, but it is going online, right?

119
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,200
 So I'm going to share another example.

120
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:28,880
 So just a few days ago, I was being oppressed at the swimming pool.

121
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,480
 And now you might be asking, is it even possible to be oppressed at the swimming pool?

122
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
 Yes.

123
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
 Why?

124
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,840
 Well, okay, so I was at my clubhouse, so I was swimming.

125
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,440
 So we're in one of those where there are no lanes, okay?

126
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,880
 No designated lanes.

127
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,000
 You know what people do?

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,160
 It's freestyle.

129
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
 So it's all over the place.

130
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,240
 It was kind of packed, not too packed, you know?

131
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,480
 And there was this, a few guys, but I'm just going to name one, okay?

132
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,040
 That swims as if it's a private pool, you know?

133
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,240
 He extends his arm as far as he could, and you know, he swims straight.

134
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,080
 And even if there's someone coming straight at him, he's like, "I can't see you.

135
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,260
 I'm just going to keep going."

136
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,840
 So what I've been doing at that time during the swimming pool is I've been dodging him

137
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
 every time.

138
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,320
 So I'll be like this, and I try to narrow my, I don't, if you guys have ever been, right?

139
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,860
 You try to narrow your movement so you don't hit the other guy.

140
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,600
 And so I was like, okay, by the fourth or the fifth lap, all right.

141
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,080
 This is getting too much, okay?

142
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,720
 So I'm like this human Tetris game.

143
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,040
 I was just trying to make my way through.

144
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,600
 So I was quite upset, honestly, I have to say.

145
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:44,960
 So I thought to myself, you know what I'm going to do next round when we come head to

146
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
 head?

147
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
 You know what I'm going to do?

148
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,120
 I'm just going to stand there, okay?

149
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,680
 Just going to stand and let him crash and realize, oh my goodness, there are other people

150
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
 in the pool too.

151
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,400
 But because of baby, I thought that might not be a very good thing to do.

152
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,560
 I don't want him to injure me.

153
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,960
 So I thought, okay, you know what?

154
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,080
 Let's find some comfort from the lifeguard.

155
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,320
 Why don't I go to him, tell him, hey, this guy is just swimming like this.

156
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,240
 But I thought, what's he going to do?

157
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,640
 He's not going to go and talk to the guy.

158
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,080
 So I'm like, forget it.

159
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,760
 So there I was still trying to swim.

160
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,760
 And then I had this thought, let's just pray.

161
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,640
 I know, maybe that's not the sort of thing you pray about.

162
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,640
 I pray about everything.

163
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,200
 So I'm like, God, you know, this guy, like, what's wrong with it?

164
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,000
 And actually, as I was praying, though, a peace started really coming into my heart.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,120
 I was just like, hey, you know, I almost sensed that God was saying, hey, don't let this guy

166
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,640
 ruin your afternoon.

167
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,400
 Like enjoy your swim.

168
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
 I was like, okay, fine.

169
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,000
 So I was swimming, dodging, I'm like, okay, and dodging.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,960
 But at the same time, though, the peace started to come and I began to just start thinking

171
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
 about other things.

172
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,480
 I was just enjoying the swim.

173
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,120
 So towards the end, you know, I only swim about half an hour.

174
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,760
 And then I was swimming to the edge of the pool where I, you know, I'm just about to

175
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
 get there.

176
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,660
 And I realized I kicked someone.

177
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,720
 And so I turned around, ah, it's that guy.

178
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,880
 He can't even see me when he's like right behind me, right?

179
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,980
 And then I was like, yes.

180
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,560
 Sorry, this is how spiritual I am, right?

181
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,520
 Not even I said yes, I was thinking, did I kick hard enough?

182
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,200
 All right, that's a side note.

183
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,080
 But I really felt, you know, God was vindicating for me.

184
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,720
 I know it's not the kind of vindication you guys are looking for.

185
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,160
 But at least, you know, it gave me a bit of comfort.

186
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,240
 And like, at least he knows that there are other people in the pool.

187
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,580
 All right, that might be a little bit of a funny/happy experience I have with God.

188
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,020
 But I want to, what I want to say is, you know, life, we're going to go through some

189
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:04,140
 oppressions, whether it's big and really depressing ones where we're going to cry over them.

190
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,740
 Or it might just simple things, but you know, it still upsets us every now and then, right?

191
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,340
 But when we bring it to God, he actually helps us.

192
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:20,100
 And many, many times, it has been where I brought it to him, and he actually eventually

193
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,900
 helps me vindicate in that area or in that situation.

194
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:34,620
 And so this, I believe as depressing as it is that there is oppression, it's only depressing

195
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,380
 if we don't have a God who would comfort us, who would listen to us, and who would bring

196
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,900
 us out of that situation at some point in his time.

197
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,300
 So I want to encourage all of us on that.

198
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:54,100
 Now as we read on in verse four to six, this is what the preacher says, "Then I saw that

199
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:00,340
 all toil and all skill in work come from a man's envy of his neighbor.

200
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,980
 This also is vanity and a striving after win.

201
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,860
 The fool folds his hands and eats his own flesh.

202
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:14,260
 There is handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind."

203
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,700
 Now in this section, we see that, as I mentioned earlier, working hard or not working hard

204
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,260
 seems to lead to the same thing, right?

205
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,220
 Because why do you want to work hard anyway?

206
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,140
 I mean, you can tell me you love your job.

207
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,140
 I love my job.

208
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,140
 All right.

209
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:36,020
 I mean, and for another reason, it might be because we want things, right?

210
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,460
 What do you want in Hong Kong?

211
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,500
 A bigger house, a bigger apartment, right?

212
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,860
 You want to be able to pay off that mortgage if you have one or rent, or if you have a

213
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,260
 car, you want a faster one.

214
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,220
 And if you're a guy, you're like, "I want a pretty wife."

215
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,780
 And so there's like something that you're always wanting more, and we're driven by this

216
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
 envy.

217
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
 Why?

218
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,500
 Because we see, "Whoa, that guy has a bigger house."

219
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,500
 And we see other people having more things.

220
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,580
 And what does that mean?

221
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,740
 We're not satisfied inside, because that's what we're motivated by, right?

222
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,460
 And then the other guy who folds his hand, it really means that he's not going to do

223
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:20,780
 anything, and he eats his own flesh, meaning that he doesn't even have enough to eat.

224
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,020
 I mean, who's going to be happy when you don't even have enough to eat?

225
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,340
 Okay.

226
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:31,260
 That is only if you are...

227
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,700
 What's the word I'm looking for?

228
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,700
 Fasting.

229
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,700
 That's right.

230
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:41,300
 But no, for most of us, if we don't have enough food, we're going to be upset.

231
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,060
 So it's here's telling us that rather you do things or not do things, you're just not

232
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,900
 satisfied.

233
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,020
 But thank goodness the preacher gives us a glimpse of what we can do.

234
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:56,340
 And in verse six, he says, "Better is a handful of quietness than two hands full of toil and

235
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,860
 still striving."

236
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:06,340
 So it's basically telling us that if we're content, if we have enough, one hand is already

237
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,340
 good enough.

238
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,420
 We don't need two and still grabbing more.

239
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,860
 And so we need contentment.

240
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:20,220
 And that's where we're going to find a solution for this kind of unfairness.

241
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,420
 And so this brings us to our second point.

242
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,260
 Even though life is unfair, you don't know if you should work or not, because either

243
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,380
 way you're not getting satisfied.

244
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:35,700
 But if we find contentment in God, then we are going to find a solution to this working

245
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,100
 problem.

246
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,260
 So how do we find contentment in God?

247
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:46,180
 The reason I said you can't just find contentment, because no matter how hard you try, you will

248
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,460
 still see someone else having something else.

249
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,620
 I mean, you guys won't, but I would.

250
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,100
 The grass is what?

251
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,220
 It's greener on the other side.

252
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,300
 You don't know why, but it's always like that, right?

253
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,420
 Maybe you have a spouse, you're like, "Oh, but that one's better."

254
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,060
 Or maybe you go to a church, you're like, "Oh, but that church is better."

255
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:14,100
 You go to work and you're like, "Oh, but that job is better than mine."

256
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:20,020
 And it's almost like, how do we have contentment unless we're in God?

257
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,780
 And what does it mean to have contentment in God?

258
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:30,220
 Well, to realize that God has measured your portion for you.

259
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,860
 That whatever it is that you have, maybe you think, "Oh, why didn't I born in a rich family?"

260
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,660
 Or you know, everybody wants to be the son of Li Ka-shing, maybe?

261
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,940
 No, no, no, maybe not.

262
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,340
 Okay, try to erase that from the tape.

263
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,140
 I mean, what is it, right?

264
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,580
 It's almost like we want something more all the time.

265
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:59,540
 But if we remember, this is the lot, this is the cup that God has provided for us, and

266
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,300
 He knows us best, and He knows what's best for us.

267
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:09,260
 Maybe this job, this relationship, maybe this study that you're doing is gonna allow you

268
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:15,300
 to learn something that if you were not, you would be very different.

269
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:21,260
 And so we need to trust God and say that, "You know, this isn't perfect, but you gave

270
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,660
 it to me, and I'm just gonna enjoy it."

271
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,100
 Now, so speaking of contentment, this continues on.

272
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:35,660
 And he says that, the preacher says, in verse 7 to 12, "Again, I saw vanity under the sun,

273
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:42,580
 one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toils.

274
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:48,340
 And his eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, 'For whom am I toiling

275
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,980
 and depriving myself of pleasure?'

276
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,620
 This also is vanity and an unhappy business.

277
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,620
 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.

278
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,260
 For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow.

279
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:09,740
 But woe to him who is alone, when he falls and has no another to lift him up.

280
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:16,020
 Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone?

281
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:21,340
 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him.

282
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,500
 A threefold cord is not quickly broken."

283
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,620
 I mean, it's quite a big chunk of scripture.

284
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,740
 But it's really telling us, if we go back and look at verse 8, it's telling us that

285
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,580
 people aren't satisfied, right?

286
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:40,300
 To a point where he's so busy, this person, that he doesn't even have time to ask, "Why

287
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,060
 am I toiling?

288
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,940
 Why am I depriving of pleasure?

289
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,580
 I'm so busy."

290
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:55,260
 And then, as we see, the reason for this toiling is because he always wants more, right?

291
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,340
 But look at it.

292
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,620
 If we are satisfied, we're content in God, we don't need to grab more.

293
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,980
 But with what we have, who do we share with?

294
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,540
 The people that God has placed around us.

295
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:15,020
 I mean, sometimes I've heard stories, I'm sure all of our men here are not like that,

296
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,500
 that they're so busy working, what happens?

297
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,220
 They miss their son or daughter's performances, right?

298
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,260
 Because they do have to work.

299
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,340
 Or when the wife wants, "Hey, let's have a date night out."

300
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,820
 I'm like, "I'm too tired."

301
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,900
 Not none of you guys, I'm just speaking to those who are not here today.

302
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,900
 And right, because we have toil.

303
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,140
 And now that's not to say not to work, right?

304
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,900
 Remember the preacher did say, "Have one handful."

305
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:55,980
 So we do work, but we also need to remember that what's important, two is better than

306
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,980
 one.

307
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,900
 Now that's not necessarily saying that married is better than not being married.

308
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,660
 Two is better than one, meaning that we have that company.

309
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,900
 And this other line saying that they were able to keep warm.

310
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,300
 So this is not a distant friend that you call up on WhatsApp, okay?

311
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,400
 This is someone who, if you needed a hug, will be there for you.

312
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,400
 And do we really cultivate and build that relationship?

313
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,720
 Or has work, money, grasping for more taken over us?

314
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,960
 What is more important to you, your job or your family?

315
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,420
 I think I spoke of one of these before where my mom calls.

316
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,720
 Even if I'm in the middle of the meeting, I'll be like, "Mom, I'm in the middle of a

317
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
 meeting.

318
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
 I'll call you back."

319
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,640
 Not because she can't wait or I cannot miss the call, but just because she is important,

320
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,720
 family.

321
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,400
 And so it tells us the preacher, in order to have contentment in God, not only are we

322
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,520
 satisfied with the things that he has given us, but also with the people that he has given

323
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
 us.

324
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,880
 So we cultivate that.

325
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:12,360
 And it says here, threefold cord is strong, meaning that we also need a community.

326
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,160
 As you saw today and many weeks here, that we have people here who might get sick and

327
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,120
 we pray for them together.

328
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,680
 We often WhatsApp them.

329
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,160
 I think Winnie and Ricky shared a few weeks ago also that there were so many people who

330
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,660
 flooded them with messages or prayers.

331
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:36,660
 And today, we've also heard about the needs of Peter and his family.

332
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:43,240
 And just this week, as Alex and Joe's baby was...

333
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,280
 Heart was going through some issues, we were all earnestly praying.

334
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
 And not only...

335
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,760
 Sometimes we think, "Well, why can't I just pray alone?

336
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,760
 I can just pray alone.

337
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,360
 I don't need to tell anyone."

338
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,760
 But the thing is, this is a support system that God has given to us, placed around us.

339
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,040
 And it's not the same.

340
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,080
 Honestly, when people message me, "How are you guys doing?

341
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,080
 How's your mom?

342
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
 How's your sister?"

343
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
 And all those...

344
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,960
 Honestly, it helps me because life is unfair.

345
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,560
 You don't know why some things hit you, right?

346
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,080
 But when those people around you, the important ones, the ones that walk with you, come, you

347
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,200
 know that it makes a difference.

348
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,760
 And also, the preacher is asking us, "The rewards that you get, don't hoard it.

349
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,040
 Share it with those people."

350
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,720
 And so I wanna put up a photo.

351
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,640
 This is my mom's birthday, and we were out at a fancy restaurant eating.

352
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:45,640
 And I wanna thank my husband there for just suggesting a really fancy restaurant, also

353
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,640
 bringing us there and treating us there.

354
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:55,000
 And I just felt like we were able to enjoy this one handful.

355
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,400
 I mean, honestly, is our job the most, I don't know, prestigious, well-paid?

356
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,720
 Probably not, actually, no.

357
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,640
 I mean, is our family perfect?

358
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
 We never fight?

359
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,520
 Nope, definitely not.

360
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:17,080
 But here we are, enjoying, content with what God is giving us.

361
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,720
 Now, of course, I'm not every moment as content as I should be, but I'm getting there, and

362
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,440
 we should all get there too.

363
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,840
 And so this helps us when we're faced with this unfairness of just working more or not

364
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
 working at all.

365
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,360
 Where is our meaning?

366
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
 What's the point?

367
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,520
 It's where we find contentment in God.

368
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,760
 Now, as we read on...

369
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,080
 So before we read on, I mean, there might be things that you're going through as well.

370
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,920
 There are some hard things that you're going through.

371
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:56,720
 But what if we just say, "Whatever it is that we're going through, God has measured it for

372
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,800
 us.

373
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,600
 He knows what He's doing.

374
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,240
 He loves us.

375
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,040
 Be content.

376
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,160
 Let's embrace that He has put into our hands."

377
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,600
 How different will our lives be?

378
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:19,400
 So as we read on, verse 13 to 16, this says, "Better was a poor and wise youth than an

379
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,400
 old and foolish king who no longer knew how to take advice, for he went from prison to

380
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,920
 the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor.

381
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,200
 I saw all the living who move about under the sun.

382
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,720
 Along with that youth, who was to stand in the king's place?

383
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,480
 There was no end to all the people, all of whom he led, yet those who come later will

384
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,520
 not rejoice in him.

385
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,320
 Surely this also is vanity and striving after the win."

386
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:59,040
 Now in verse 13, it tells us that the poor and wise youth, this person, would eventually

387
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,760
 come to throne.

388
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,520
 So there was an older king, but he's now foolish because he won't be taking any advice.

389
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:16,480
 And so what we see here in these few verses is it's trying to tell us that no matter what

390
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,640
 high achievements you have, even if you were a king, of course we don't have kings in Hong

391
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,560
 Kong, but even if you've reached a milestone of your life, someone else will take over

392
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,640
 and that you will be forgotten.

393
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
 So it's all vanity, right?

394
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,640
 I mean, it's unfair.

395
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,720
 I mean, we've worked so hard for what?

396
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
 Nothing.

397
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,040
 But how do we face that?

398
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,600
 Now again, the preacher gives us a clue.

399
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,920
 And he says, "Better was poor and wise."

400
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:52,160
 I'm pretty sure he's not asking us to be poor, but I think he's asking us to be wise.

401
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,560
 Now think about it.

402
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,760
 This young guy, this young man who would be king, where did he come from?

403
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,600
 He actually came from prison, according to the Bible verse.

404
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,960
 And was he rich?

405
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,560
 No, he was poor.

406
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:12,840
 And yet because of the wisdom that he has, he made it to the throne.

407
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,160
 He probably listened to people's advice.

408
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,840
 I take it that the verse is trying to compare the two, right?

409
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,160
 And so what does that tell us?

410
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,320
 What is the preacher trying to tell us?

411
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,840
 Is that as futile as it is that everything is just going to vanish or your accomplishments

412
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,800
 will not be remembered?

413
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,320
 Yet it is still better to be wise.

414
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,080
 Now why is that?

415
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,280
 Well think about it.

416
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,000
 If we were all that youth, do you want to be stuck in prison?

417
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,600
 Do you want to be stuck in poverty?

418
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,040
 Probably not.

419
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:55,160
 Even though things are going to pass, I probably want a slightly smoother path, slightly more

420
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,920
 comfortable one.

421
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,840
 And you know, God's not asking us to, you have to choose the path that leads you to

422
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,440
 despair, right?

423
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
 No.

424
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,440
 And so this brings us to our third point that yeah, life is unfair.

425
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,520
 Things will pass no matter how high you climb, but seek God for wisdom.

426
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,640
 Now why do I say seek God for wisdom?

427
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,600
 Because where do wisdom come from?

428
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,720
 Only God.

429
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
 Only God.

430
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,960
 Because wisdom is what?

431
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
 What is wisdom?

432
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,480
 Can anyone define for me?

433
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,120
 Don't worry, I've been doing this the whole week so I can say it.

434
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,880
 Is really being able to discern what is good and what is bad.

435
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,320
 To be able to make good judgment.

436
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,440
 That's wisdom.

437
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,280
 But does that come from us?

438
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
 No.

439
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,080
 And it can never really come from us.

440
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:55,560
 And one of the reasons that it cannot come from us is because we don't have that humbleness.

441
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,480
 I mean, think about it.

442
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,980
 You cannot know everything.

443
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,540
 You cannot always make the best choices.

444
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,920
 But God has probably placed some people around you with some wisdom.

445
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,040
 But if you think, "Oh, I know everything.

446
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,440
 I don't need this."

447
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,800
 Then you're always going to be limited to yourself.

448
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,680
 And even if God wanted to speak to you, you'd be like, "Oh, no, no thank you.

449
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,280
 I'm good."

450
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,140
 And that's what happened to the foolish king, right?

451
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:26,840
 So unless we have wisdom from God to discern what is good, what is bad, we're going to

452
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,280
 make our own judgment and most likely we're going to stay in prison, stay in poverty.

453
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,840
 This is the analogy.

454
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:42,560
 So what we want to do, despite how this life might pass and your accomplishments will be

455
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:47,120
 over, it is yet still better to have wisdom from God.

456
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,560
 Now over the years, I've realized that God allows us to learn from our mistakes too.

457
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,120
 So that's part of the journey, right?

458
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,840
 And I remember maybe a year ago, I was also sharing that there was a time in my life when

459
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:09,520
 I was dating a guy and that he was actually a pastor to be, but he has committed something

460
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,360
 so serious that I really had to second guess.

461
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,840
 Of course, my mom and people who were wise told me, "Don't continue with this guy."

462
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:28,760
 But at first I thought, "But the Bible says love, love is like never giving up."

463
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,800
 I mean, how do I discern?

464
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,200
 How do I choose?

465
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,240
 But then at the end of the day, I remember my mom was literally yelling at me on the

466
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,600
 bus, well, over the phone, okay?

467
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,920
 We don't do this face-to-face bus fight.

468
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,520
 So over the phone, she's like, "When are you going to stop being so stubborn and listen

469
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,320
 to people's advice?"

470
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,560
 And of course, what do you do as a daughter when your mom yells at you like that?

471
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,400
 You cut the line.

472
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
 You cut the line.

473
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,400
 Because why?

474
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,400
 You didn't want to hear that.

475
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,080
 You're like, "You think I'm stupid."

476
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,560
 And but that line keeps on ringing in your head, right?

477
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,000
 You just keep thinking about it.

478
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,520
 Oh yeah, she is right.

479
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,200
 She had been right many times.

480
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:20,920
 And really, I believe unless it was God, I mean, unless it was God, I wouldn't have been

481
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,360
 able to be so clear about this discernment.

482
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,600
 And I end up breaking up with that person.

483
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,960
 And honestly, three months later, I thought it was the best decision I've ever made in

484
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,160
 my life.

485
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:38,880
 And honestly, what I wanted to say is wisdom doesn't come from ourselves.

486
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,520
 And wisdom ties a lot with humbleness.

487
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,360
 Because we can't hear people.

488
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,560
 We can't, even if we read a nice article that gives us a lot of wisdom, but if we're blocked,

489
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,360
 if we're blind, we cannot go through.

490
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,240
 We cannot understand, we cannot comprehend it.

491
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,360
 We cannot take it in.

492
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,440
 So we must pray that even in the midst of while your life, our lives, our accomplishments

493
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,960
 might be override eventually, that God still didn't want us to walk in a very rough life.

494
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,600
 He wants to help us.

495
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,960
 So we have to ask him for wisdom.

496
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:25,760
 And so today I've put it up on here for you that the, you know, last week we had chapter

497
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,920
 three and remember what that specialty about chapter three was?

498
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,480
 There's a time for everything.

499
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,400
 And we had parallels.

500
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,720
 And this time, actually in chapter four, we also have a specialty is actually called better.

501
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:50,200
 And what we see is under oppression, the author tells us that it is better kind of to not

502
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,040
 have been born, to not have seen this, or maybe even more fortunate if you were dead.

503
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,680
 Now he's definitely not asking us to commit suicide.

504
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,400
 Okay, please do not take this out of context.

505
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,120
 But what he's saying is if we don't have a comforter, yes, we'll feel like this, but

506
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,480
 better yet is that we have a comforter.

507
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,080
 And also when we're under a lot of meaningless toils, when we're just wanting to grab more,

508
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
 what does he say?

509
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,120
 Verse six, nine, better is a handful of quietness.

510
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,120
 And also two are better than one.

511
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,200
 He's saying, be content with what you have, share it with those people he has placed around

512
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
 us.

513
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,000
 That's how we overcome this meaningless toil.

514
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,680
 And lastly, he says these endless achievements, what's the point?

515
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,400
 He says better was poor and wise.

516
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,800
 I'm pretty sure the poor part's not what he's trying to highlight, but wise.

517
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:49,340
 Let us ask God to give us wisdom to have that humbleness.

518
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,040
 So today I want to leave you with just a few questions at the end, which is, I mean, how

519
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,720
 have you been living your life?

520
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,080
 I mean, when you were oppressed, maybe the little things like me at the swimming pool

521
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,680
 or bigger things in life, how have you faced them?

522
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,280
 Do you bring them to God or do you talk to people and try to solve it yourself?

523
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,640
 What is it that you do?

524
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,320
 And when you have all these resources, do you still just want more or do you begin to

525
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:23,160
 see the importance of family, your friends, your church, to cultivate those, to spend

526
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:28,240
 more time on those instead of getting one or two more zeros at the end of your bank

527
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
 account?

528
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:35,000
 Hopefully in front of the decimal and not after.

529
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,760
 And lastly, really knowing that everything will pass, yet God still wants us to have

530
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,560
 wisdom to live through this life to help us.

531
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,800
 Do we go and ask him, "Give me wisdom."

532
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,780
 So let's look to God for our answers.

533
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:58,760
 And I do believe that Ecclesiastes chapter four do show a lot of unfairness in this world.

534
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,320
 But at the same time, I don't believe that was a footstop of period.

535
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,700
 It was a chance for us to turn to God.

536
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:14,000
 And so let's pray together and respond in a way that ask us to think about how we respond

537
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,240
 in life.

538
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:23,440
 Dear Heavenly Father, we know that there are oppression, there are meaningless toils and

539
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,240
 achievements will pass.

540
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,600
 And yet Father, you're with us through that.

541
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,960
 In every one of those unfair situation that you have not left us alone, that you are our

542
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,520
 ultimate comforter.

543
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,840
 You are the one that gives us contentment in this world so we don't have to feel dissatisfied.

544
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:54,760
 And Father, you are the one that gives us true wisdom so that in our lives, you don't

545
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,040
 mean it for us to suffer.

546
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,880
 You mean for us to walk with you.

547
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:05,760
 And so Father, we just pray together that as we face any of these situations in our

548
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,080
 lives that we'll remember to turn to you for our strength, for our shield.

549
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,040
 We'll remember to turn to you as our source of help.

550
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,120
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

551
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,880
 (ice clattering)
