[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hey, good to see you all.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.660]   Really, really good.
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.120]   Hope you've enjoyed a little bit of sunshine,
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.960]   managed to get out.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.460]   It's the best time of year in Hong Kong, I believe,
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.620]   in terms of weather,
[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.900]   in terms of just being able to go out
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.020]   and get some fresh air.
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.820]   Again, we know that things are still not good,
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.700]   but I'm delighted actually to be able to open up
[00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.280]   the Word of God today
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.140]   and the passage that Anthony just read to us.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.620]   John chapter eight, verse 12.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.260]   And actually I am going to share screen
[00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.180]   just like Pastor Johnny did last week.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.220]   And hopefully it will work the same for me.
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.300]   And of course, this is some new tech that we have here.
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.280]   Can you see me floating on the slide?
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.060]   We can, and I'm gonna make myself a little bit bigger.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.380]   I don't look as good as Johnny.
[00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.180]   Seems to have cut a little bit of my hair off,
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.140]   but I will make it work.
[00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.640]   I'm just gonna make myself a little bit bigger,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.940]   just so it's a little bit more overwhelming.
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.200]   There we go.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.040]   How's that?
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.560]   It's good?
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.300]   I am the light of the world.
[00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.500]   And it's, you know, what a statement to make.
[00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.460]   And Jesus spoke to them saying,
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.420]   "I am the light of the world.
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.860]   Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness,
[00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.900]   but will have the light of life."
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.220]   What an audacious statement.
[00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.980]   Now, we've heard this word before.
[00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.900]   If you've grown up in church, you will have heard this.
[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900]   You will have sang it.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.060]   The song that we just sang 10, 15 minutes ago,
[00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.620]   "Light of the world, you step down into darkness."
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.900]   So we've heard this word.
[00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.700]   We know what this means.
[00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.680]   Do we?
[00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.680]   Do we actually genuinely know what this means?
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.680]   Or actually, do we take it for granted?
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.040]   'Cause actually, it's an audacious statement.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.920]   Can you imagine meeting someone
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.880]   and they tell you that they are the light of the world?
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.600]   Just to rewind a little bit of context here,
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.080]   when Jesus said this,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.720]   he said this just after a major festival
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.280]   in the Jewish tradition.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.120]   And during that time,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.400]   they would have had candles everywhere.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.800]   What do those candles symbolize?
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.660]   Those candles would symbolize or represent
[00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.940]   the pillar of fire that the Israelites followed
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.100]   during their time in the desert with Moses.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.340]   And it's in that context, with that backdrop,
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.020]   Jesus says, "I know you're seeing these candles right here.
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.980]   I know you're remembering everything that went on
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.420]   with the Israelites back then,
[00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.700]   but I'm telling you, I am the light of the world."
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.720]   It sounds poetic.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.620]   It sounds meaningful, we think.
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620]   But then we wonder, actually,
[00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.840]   do he truly understand what it means
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.920]   for him to be the light of the world?
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.760]   What does it mean?
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.080]   Is it just an abstract concept or is there more?
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.040]   And today I want to unpack what this term really means.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.040]   And my prayer is that we'll leave this call
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.960]   or leave this stream
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.640]   and have a slightly better understanding
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.240]   of what it means when Jesus says,
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.540]   "He is the light of the world."
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.600]   'Cause I think there's a more holistic
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.640]   understanding of this.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.760]   And there's also a much more specific understanding of this
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.640]   that I think we would do well to be able to grasp.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.580]   See, it's interesting.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.740]   He says this, "I'm the light of the world.
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.860]   Whoever follows me and will not walk in darkness,
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.980]   but will have the light of life."
[00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.260]   And then the Pharisees, actually very understandably so,
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.180]   then said, "Well, you're bearing witness about yourself.
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.620]   Your testimony is not true."
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.460]   He's kind of saying,
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.540]   "Well, you can't just say this about yourself.
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.420]   You can't just make these kinds of statements."
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.660]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.220]   You can't just say that you're the light of the world
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.860]   and we're all going to believe you.
[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.000]   Why? Why should we even believe you?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.860]   And then Jesus' response is,
[00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.560]   "Even if I do bear witness about myself,
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.680]   my testimony is true,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.800]   for I know where I came from and where I am going.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.120]   But you do not know where I come from or where I'm going."
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.520]   So he's saying here is,
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.720]   "Look, I can bear witness about myself
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.960]   because I know where I came from
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.240]   and I know where I'm going."
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.000]   So when I say, "I am the light of the world,"
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.480]   you need to understand that it's got
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.480]   a much bigger meaning that he's trying to reveal here.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.400]   And so today that's what we're going to do.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.000]   As we look at this term, the light of the world,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.080]   I really feel that there's actually three parts.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.000]   He says, "Look, I bear witness about myself and it's true
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.760]   because I know where I came from
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.360]   and I know where I'm going."
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.600]   And so I want to split this into three simple parts here.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.400]   When we understand the light of the world,
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.640]   there's really three elements here I want to really unpack.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.400]   That there's almost a past tense.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.840]   There's something about where he came from.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.360]   There's a present tense 'cause he stood there declaring,
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.200]   "I am the light of the world.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.400]   Whoever will follow me now will not walk in darkness."
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.960]   And then there's a future tense.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.040]   "I know where I came from, but I also know where I'm going."
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.680]   So in order to fully understand,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.360]   or at least we only know understand in part right now,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.040]   but in order to understand more,
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.000]   we need to look into all these elements.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.040]   And so we'll kick off with the first one
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.120]   and that is the past.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.600]   "I am the light of the world."
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.400]   You see, when he said that,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.040]   you need to understand the people who are listening,
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.040]   they know what light means.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.360]   They haven't, electricity has not been invented yet.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.280]   So when people talk about light,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.280]   it was often used as a common religious description.
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.120]   It was referring to God.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.360]   See, when we think about the word light,
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.120]   we're thinking about the flashlight on our phone.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.680]   We're thinking about the light that we switch on
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.000]   when we go into a room.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.080]   But what they think of when they hear light is life.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.360]   The word light and life were very much associated
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.680]   in the very beginning.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.480]   In the beginning, Genesis one,
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.920]   God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.720]   The earth was without form and void
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.960]   and darkness was over the face of the deep.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.320]   And the spirit of God was hovering
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.840]   over the face of the waters.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.080]   And then what does he say?
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.080]   And God said, "Let there be light."
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.160]   And there was light.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.400]   And God saw that the light was good
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.520]   and God separated the light from the darkness.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.320]   So when this world was without form,
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.600]   void and dark, there was no life.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.360]   God let us those four words, "Let there be light."
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.520]   He creates everything by speaking it into existence.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.880]   Can you see the relationship between light and life here?
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.400]   And actually he's saying that he's been here
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.680]   in the beginning, right from the very start.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.160]   When he says he's the light of the world,
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.680]   it's not just right now shining onto your life right now.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.400]   He's saying, "I've been there since the beginning."
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.320]   In the beginning.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.520]   Where else have we heard those words?
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.360]   In the beginning.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.680]   What other part of the Bible have we heard those words?
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.240]   They're exactly the same, they mirror it.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.480]   Of course, it's in the book of John.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.160]   The book of John starts in the same way.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.720]   In the beginning was the word and the word was with God
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.560]   and the word was God.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.040]   He was in the beginning with God.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.200]   All things were made through him
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.800]   and without him was not made,
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.920]   not anything that was made.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.400]   In him was life and the life was the light of man.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.760]   The light shines in the darkness
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.720]   and the darkness has not overcome it.
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.200]   So we see here that Jesus is declaring himself
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.440]   to be a very big deal.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.200]   He's not just talking about the here and now.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.960]   He's not talking about, "Oh, I light up the room
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.600]   because I'm that kind of exuberant extrovert
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.040]   that likes to talk to people."
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.000]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.440]   'Cause he says, "I know where I'm coming from,
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.560]   but I know where I'm going.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.640]   I am the light of the world and my witness,
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.840]   my testimony about myself is true
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.880]   because I've been there since the beginning,
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.520]   since the very beginning.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.560]   And you can see me in your story, Israelites,
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.240]   in your history, you can see me."
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.440]   I just mentioned this in Exodus 13,
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.960]   when they were still wandering, they left Egypt,
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.280]   they were wandering in the wilderness
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.920]   because they hadn't learned what God wanted them to learn.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.360]   to lead them along the way.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.720]   And by night in a pillar of fire to give them light
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.680]   that they may travel by day and night.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.640]   Can you imagine just being there in the wilderness
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.960]   in the evening, suddenly you'll see, not suddenly,
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.400]   you'll just always see this pillar of fire.
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:02.160]   Just understand that for a second,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.840]   but also understand and feel the assurance
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.880]   that that would have.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.520]   The one who can create a pillar of fire
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.440]   out of nowhere is with you and he is guiding you.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.760]   So we're starting to see the weight,
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.800]   we're starting to see the gravity of what Jesus is saying
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.360]   when he's saying, "I am the light of the world.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.120]   I can say this is true because I know where I came from.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.200]   I was in the beginning.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.400]   I was the spirit of God, hovering above the waters.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.000]   I was the pillar of fire guiding you."
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.240]   Jesus saying, "I represent God's presence.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.760]   I represent God's protection.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.640]   I represent God's guidance.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.600]   I'm a big deal."
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.560]   And whilst the Israelites were led through the night,
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.280]   we will be led through the darkness as well.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.840]   Jesus here is claiming to be this divine presence
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.800]   where he is going to save God's people from bondage.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.880]   He's going to save God's people from darkness.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.480]   So do we recognize the magnitude of this declaration?
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.800]   We have to take it seriously.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.720]   The context of it, the statement demands
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.360]   that we take him seriously
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.040]   because life is so dependent on light.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.080]   Those of you who know me a little bit,
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.280]   I've told what I used to do before,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.800]   but before we came to Hong Kong,
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.080]   before we went into full-time ministry,
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.160]   I was a biology teacher.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.040]   I taught for seven years
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.360]   in a secondary school teaching biology.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.160]   Not sure how many of you here like biology.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.840]   Actually, I personally really wasn't one of them.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.640]   I probably wasn't that great a teacher either.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.240]   But so one of the things that you learn in biology,
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.560]   here's a word that you may not have heard in a long time,
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.800]   photosynthesis.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.760]   Does anyone know what photosynthesis means?
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.960]   That really interesting topic at school
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.040]   where you got to look at plants
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.720]   and you got to draw plants.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.200]   Photosynthesis is about,
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.840]   plants are primary producers
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.960]   and they then basically they absorb sunlight.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.920]   The sun is the source of all energy.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:04.320]   Actually, we won't be alive were it not for the sun
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.240]   because the sun has this light energy
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.760]   absorbed by these primary producers, plants,
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.560]   and then they're consumed
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.480]   and then there are secondary consumers and so forth.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.160]   And then you go the food chain until we're eating all of it.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:22.840]   That's the magnitude of Jesus' statement here.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.840]   He's saying, "Without me, you won't have life."
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.480]   I was there at the beginning
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.840]   and without me, you won't have life.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.600]   Now, you've got a choice here.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.720]   There's this guy who's coming out
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.440]   with this very audacious statement.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.200]   He says, "You know where he came from
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.680]   and what he's saying is true.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.560]   Without him, you won't have life."
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.080]   You have a couple of choices here.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.400]   You can, one, decide that he's a lunatic,
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.560]   that he's just crazy.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.440]   Okay, fair enough.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.400]   You believe you're the light of the world or whatever.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.440]   Second is he could be a fraud, he could be lying.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.560]   Or the final option is that he really is who he says he is.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.640]   And for those of us on this call,
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:10.160]   I trust many of us here believe that Jesus is saying,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.320]   Jesus actually means what he says and it's true.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.680]   His testimony about himself is true.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.040]   But how often do we truly appreciate that?
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.120]   When we actually, so much we treat ourselves as just,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.280]   I'm seeing there are some real geeks in the chat box.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:30.280]   I cannot help myself but just give you a big tick
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.200]   and a sticker, sticker for you, Mark and Veronica,
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.000]   for giving us the equation to the 30 sentences.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.840]   Thank you.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.680]   All right.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:44.120]   We recognize that without him, that we can't live.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.120]   He's the light of the world.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.400]   Acts 17, 28 says this,
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.880]   "For in him, we live and move and have our being."
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.240]   He's the center of everything.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.800]   Our lives revolve around him.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.280]   Do we appreciate the magnitude of this statement
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.480]   when he says, "I am the light of the world"?
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.560]   That's number one.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.640]   That's the past element to this declaration.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.720]   The second is the present,
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.480]   because it's not just the fact that he was in the beginning
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.920]   before everything was created.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.240]   It wasn't just the fact that he could utter words
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.240]   and creation would happen.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:23.240]   How many of us would love to just be able
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.240]   to speak things into existence?
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.880]   But Jesus could do that.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.600]   But it's not just from before.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.760]   It's not just the pillar of fire and desert.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.560]   It's also got a present element to it.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.640]   There's a very direct implication for the present as well.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.840]   By declaring he's the light of the world,
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.080]   he's also revealing himself.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.320]   You see, what else is light associated with?
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.280]   One is associated with life.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:50.120]   The second is associated with sight.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.320]   That we'll be able to see things, right?
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.320]   When you walk into a room
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.160]   and you can't see anything in the nighttime,
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.480]   you switch on the light and then, voila, you can see things.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.520]   It reveals.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.080]   So light then allows us to have sight.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.560]   The Psalmist would say,
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.440]   "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.680]   His word and his name is Jesus himself
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.160]   is the one who will guide, who will show us how to walk.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.320]   There's an importance in that,
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.080]   not only does it give us life from the past till now,
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.680]   but it also gives us sight.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.760]   It's revealing right now.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.680]   When you have light, you will be able to see.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.680]   C.S. Lewis has this great quote that says,
[00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:34.040]   "We believe in God like we believe in the sun."
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.800]   Not because we see the sun,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.200]   but because by the sun, we see everything else.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.280]   Because by the sun, we see everything else.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.240]   So when we have the light of the world,
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.360]   we get to see everything else.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.200]   We get to see the path that we're supposed to walk down.
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.480]   How many of us are currently navigating our lives
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.320]   and going, "Which way do I go?
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.800]   What do I do?
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.640]   Where do I live?
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.480]   Where do I work?
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.320]   Where do I study?
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.320]   Who should I marry?"
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.520]   And Jesus is declaring himself,
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.360]   "Hey, follow me.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.960]   I am the way.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.720]   I am the light.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.760]   I will be the one that shines a light down the path
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.360]   that you were supposed to take,
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.120]   where you are supposed to go."
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.800]   But it's actually even more than that.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.160]   When we say that the light of the world
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.080]   has a present element,
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.920]   it's not just the fact he will show us where to go.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.280]   He's not just a torch.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.080]   He doesn't just reveal the path.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:24.920]   There is more.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.120]   And in that, finding that,
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.640]   we have to rewind a little bit into the context.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.240]   So this verse is chapter eight, verse 12.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.120]   If you just scan up to the beginning of chapter eight,
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.840]   what prompts Jesus to say this audacious declaration?
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.440]   It's a scene that we all know probably very well,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.920]   and it's the woman who's caught in adultery.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.040]   She's caught in adultery.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.400]   And actually, at this point,
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.960]   the Pharisees who catch her,
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.240]   they have every right to just stone her to death right there
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.800]   according to the law.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.920]   She could be gone already.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.080]   Yet, actually, good for her,
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.600]   they actually had a bigger fish to fry.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.800]   They didn't want to just stone her.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.000]   They didn't want to just get her.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.360]   They wanted to get Jesus.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.920]   So instead of dealing with her themselves
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.520]   and punishing her and killing her,
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.040]   they take her to Jesus, hoping to set a trap,
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.760]   hoping to get him to expose some of the cracks
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:20.320]   in what he's thinking so they could expose him.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.560]   And so they take him to Jesus and say,
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.240]   "Hey, what do you think?"
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.720]   And they test him.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.120]   And then, of course, we all know Jesus then ignores them,
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.240]   starts walking, starts writing in the sand,
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.760]   and then he says those famous words,
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.560]   "Let him who is without sin among you
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   "be the first to throw a stone at her."
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:39.080]   He almost calls their bluff and sets a trap for them.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.840]   And then at that point, one by one, they start to leave.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.600]   And then Jesus stands up and says,
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.640]   "Woman, where are they?
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.840]   "Has no one condemned you?"
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.000]   She said, "No one, Lord."
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.480]   Then Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.360]   "Go, and from now on, sin no more."
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.560]   And so what can we learn from this passage here,
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.320]   where Jesus is confronted with this trap,
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.840]   and then he says the words to her,
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.760]   "Neither do I condemn you.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.280]   "Go, and from now on, sin no more."
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.960]   And it's directly after this passage,
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.880]   chapter eight, verse 11, "From now on, sin no more."
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.640]   And then verse 12, he jumps into it.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.360]   "Again," Jesus spoke to them and said,
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.680]   "I am the light of the world."
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.480]   So when we're thinking about Jesus
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.320]   being the light of the world,
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.760]   it's not just the fact that he gives life.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.680]   It's not just the fact that he reveals sight.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.800]   It's also something to do with how we live.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.120]   The context here tells us it's about our behavior.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.280]   It's about our actions.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.680]   It's not just about the path that we're supposed to go down.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.280]   It's about how we go down it.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.320]   Whoever, 'cause he says, "I'm the light of the world.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.920]   "Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness."
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.960]   So this is the second element here
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.880]   when we're talking about Jesus being the light of the world
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.240]   and the presence is that we cannot walk with him
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.120]   and follow him and also still walk in darkness.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.200]   One John says, "God is light,
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.960]   "and in him is no darkness at all."
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.160]   When there is light, there is not darkness.
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.360]   The two cannot coexist.
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.800]   They cannot be together.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.840]   Anne Frank, in her diaries from the World War II days,
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.520]   said, "Look how a single candle can defy
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.120]   "and define darkness."
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.840]   So we see, actually, light and darkness can never coexist
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:29.000]   because darkness isn't really a thing.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.800]   Because darkness isn't really a thing.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.200]   We see Einstein, who says, what does he say?
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.680]   "Darkness is merely the absence of light."
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.240]   So when we have light shine into a room,
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.320]   darkness is dispelled,
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.160]   but not because darkness is a thing that's been on Earth,
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.680]   'cause darkness is nothing.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.400]   Darkness is simply the absence of light.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.200]   And he says, "You can't study darkness.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.440]   "How can you study darkness?
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.320]   "To know how dark a certain place is,
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:57.040]   "you simply measure the amount of light in it."
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.720]   So we see here that darkness and light cannot coexist.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.360]   So what Jesus is saying here is,
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.320]   if you follow me, there cannot be any darkness in your life.
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:11.680]   And there'll be no more need to be afraid
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.640]   of the darkness either.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.560]   See, often we're afraid of the dark,
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.960]   and children are often afraid of the dark.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.560]   Not really because they're afraid of the dark,
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   but just really because they can't see what's there.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.600]   They're afraid what's in the dark
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.560]   as opposed to afraid of the dark.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.000]   And so Jesus is saying, "Don't, don't be afraid.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.480]   "I am the light of the world."
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.120]   And there's this quote that I'll just simply paraphrase,
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.400]   'cause I can't remember exactly where it was,
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.760]   but it's, "If you fear God, you'll fear nothing else.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.360]   "But if you don't fear God, you'll fear everything else.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.960]   "If you fear God, you will fear nothing else,
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.240]   "because he's the light of the world.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.560]   "But if you don't fear God, you will fear everything else."
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.480]   And in order for us to fear God,
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.640]   we have to walk and follow him.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.280]   And when we walk and follow him,
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.640]   we must not allow any darkness to be in our lives.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.040]   So here's a question I'm gonna turn to you now.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.360]   Is there any darkness in your lives?
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.480]   Is there any darkness?
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.720]   Is there any crevice of your life, of your heart,
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:15.640]   where actually you have not allowed Jesus into?
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.720]   Jesus being the light of the world,
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.880]   is desiring to not only give you life,
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.240]   is not only desiring to reveal to your path,
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.160]   but he's also desiring to cleanse.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.240]   Is there a part of you,
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.560]   is there something that you are not willing to let go of?
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.200]   Because as children of God,
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.720]   as we follow the light of the world,
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:40.080]   when we follow him, we must not walk in darkness.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.960]   Through this last month,
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.840]   I've been just going through the book of Philippians
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.560]   and just memorizing it and just trying to meditate on it.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.120]   And this passage in Philippians 2,
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.600]   that's just really hit me.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.800]   And it says, "Do all things without grumbling,
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.280]   so that you may be blameless and innocent.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.400]   Children of God without blemish
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.920]   in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.960]   among whom you shine as lights in the world."
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.120]   Are we all agreed that we live
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.600]   in a crooked and twisted generation right now?
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.800]   And yet God is calling us and saying,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.200]   we are children of God without blemish
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.560]   in the midst of this crooked and twisted generation
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.360]   among whom you shine as lights in the world.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:27.760]   See, when God shines on you, the darkness is dispelled.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.760]   You must look different.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.600]   Just before service here,
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.720]   I think one of our dear sisters was just talking
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.960]   about everything that's happening in this world.
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.400]   And she's saying, "For those of us who are believers,
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.720]   we must look different.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.560]   We are children of God without blemish
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.640]   in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.400]   We have the light of the world.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.640]   We fear God.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.440]   And because of that, we fear nothing else
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.360]   because we know that God is on our side."
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.240]   So the question here is this,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.080]   and this one has been convicting me.
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.000]   During this time in Hong Kong,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.640]   during this time in the world,
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.880]   how different do we look to the next person?
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.440]   How different do you look to the next person?
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.000]   Are you a child of God without blemish
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.160]   in the midst of this crooked and twisted generation?
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.560]   Are you shining as a light in the world?
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:23.560]   That's a hard question to ponder on.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.360]   'Cause so often I find whenever I'm meeting people,
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.360]   I'm just complaining, I'm complaining, I'm grumbling,
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.560]   I'm just frustrated at what's happening.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.760]   I'm feeling hopeless, I'm feeling angry, I'm feeling sad.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.520]   Now, of course, all those emotions are true,
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.600]   but yet, and they're right to have.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:41.080]   But still, there must be something that separates us
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.080]   if we have the light of the world in us.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.240]   We must have this difference that shines through us,
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.320]   and I'll talk a little bit more about that later.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.360]   So it's not just visually seeing this path now
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.680]   because we have the light in the world
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.920]   'cause we're following him,
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.920]   but we also have to morally live it out.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.680]   Wouldn't I love just to have a pair of special goggles
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:03.400]   that had a special light that could see exactly where COVID
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.000]   and exactly where Omicron was
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.880]   and all the surfaces that we're walking around
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.320]   and all the people that we meet,
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.600]   that we can see just Omicron just waiting to pounce on us.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.000]   Wouldn't I love to have that light to reveal to us?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.880]   Again, another element of light is UV light
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.560]   that's often used to disinfect.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.280]   In some ways, it reminds me that Jesus,
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.560]   when he says he wants to shine his light into your life,
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.240]   he's also desiring to shine and kill away
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.240]   all the things that are not of him.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.040]   The question is, are there some things
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.480]   that we are actually holding onto?
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.160]   This light of the world that is revealing and cleansing,
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.000]   do we really allow it to shine into every aspect
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.920]   of our lives or is there some sin?
[00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.600]   Because if you're a follower of Christ,
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.080]   if you are a believer and follower of the light of the world,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   we will not walk in darkness.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.400]   And I wanna challenge you, brothers and sisters,
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.960]   if there's anything that is holding onto you,
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.240]   if there is any sin that isn't of God,
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.120]   anything that you're tempted to do when you're on your own,
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.120]   giving in to fleshly desires,
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.360]   or when you look at someone who has something you want
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.880]   and the envy that comes out,
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.280]   or when you look at a certain group of people
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.200]   or a certain person, you're filled with this anger
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.680]   that isn't a righteous anger,
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.320]   do you have this in your heart?
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.520]   Because if you follow the light of the world,
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.680]   you must not walk in that darkness any longer.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:22.400]   Open yourself up and allow him to create in you a clean,
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.000]   a new heart, renew the right spirit in you
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.240]   to shine that light into your lives
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   because he is the light of the world.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.800]   And finally, so it was the past element,
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.920]   there's a present element,
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.040]   and finally, there's a future element.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.440]   He says, "What I'm saying is true
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.480]   because one, I know where I came from,
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:46.080]   and two, I know where I'm going."
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.200]   So there's a future element to this as well.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.360]   So what is that?
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.200]   What is he saying?
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.720]   What is he thinking about when he's saying,
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.880]   "I am the light of the world,
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.840]   and there is a future element."
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.800]   Imagine being able to know the beginning
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.200]   and the end of your story,
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.440]   well, not just your story,
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.680]   imagine being able to know the beginning
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.480]   and the end of this whole story here.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.680]   And that's Jesus' vantage point.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.960]   And he's saying, "I'm the light of the world,
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.840]   and I know where I'm going.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.840]   Where am I going?
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.400]   You don't know, but I do,
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.960]   but later it's revealed to us."
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.080]   And it's in the book of Revelation.
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.600]   See, the final couple of chapters in Revelation
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.040]   almost seem very similar
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.400]   to the very first chapters in Genesis.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.520]   There's a new creation that's being created,
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.680]   and at the very end here,
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   he's talking about another new creation.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.560]   This is where he's going, Revelation 21.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.880]   "And I saw no temple in the city,
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.960]   for its temple is the Lord God,
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.360]   the Almighty and the Light.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:39.560]   And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it,
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.280]   for the glory of God gives it light,
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.520]   and its lamp is the Lamb.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.040]   By its light will the nations walk,
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.440]   and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it,
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.280]   and its gates will never be shut by day,
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   and there will be no night there."
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.920]   And then in 22, it says this,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.360]   "And night will be no more.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.560]   They will need no light of lamp or sun,
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.200]   for the Lord God will be their light,
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.160]   and they will reign forever and ever."
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.960]   Let's just stop there for a second.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.440]   This new earth, this new heaven,
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.880]   that Jesus, again, is gonna speak into existence,
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.520]   will have no night.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:16.920]   There will be no darkness.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.040]   His light will shine across the whole thing.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:21.440]   Those of us who like sleeping a lot,
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.080]   maybe we'll receive that as bad news,
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.080]   but I'm sure the Lord will help us in that regard.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.560]   There will be no night there.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.600]   There will be no darkness.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.760]   That's what Jesus is saying
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.120]   when he's saying, "I am the light of the world."
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.640]   There is gonna be a place
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.560]   where I'm gonna transform your lowly body
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.560]   to be like my glorious body.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.200]   And you will not need light anymore.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.280]   You will not need your phones to light things anymore,
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.360]   because I am the light of the world,
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:51.000]   and I, just like I have powered this whole world
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:51.920]   that you've lived here,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.320]   I will power this new heaven and this new earth.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.280]   So those who embrace the life of Jesus here
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:01.240]   will receive this resurrected life of his,
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.360]   where there will be no more pain.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.280]   There will be no more suffering.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.280]   There will be no more sickness or death.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.200]   Travel restrictions will finally be removed.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:13.560]   He is the light of the world,
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.200]   both past, present, and future.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   And then the apostle Paul says,
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.640]   "For God who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,'
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.040]   has shone in our hearts
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.760]   to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.720]   in the face of Jesus Christ."
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.840]   The light that we'll need forever and ever
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.440]   will emanate from Jesus himself.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.280]   His promise of Jesus will be fulfilled.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.800]   He's promised us that we will never walk
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.080]   in darkness anymore.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.600]   Those valleys of the shadow of death will be gone.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.800]   That, brothers and sisters,
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.640]   that fact, that future element
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.520]   should be all we need to navigate life now.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:01.160]   When we are filled with hopelessness,
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.360]   when we are frustrated,
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.040]   when we don't know where the future goes,
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.760]   we know someone who does.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.840]   He knows where he came from
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.760]   and he knows where he's going.
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:12.800]   And that should light up your life.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.440]   That should give you life.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.040]   That should purify you.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.640]   That should reveal to you what to do next
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.160]   because Jesus is the one that is living within us.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.440]   So the question really is, okay,
[00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.880]   there's this abstract big concept.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   It's holistic and it's specific.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.080]   But what does it mean for us right now?
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.720]   Those of us who are living in Hong Kong,
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.560]   believers, followers of Christ,
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:40.400]   what does it mean for us?
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.120]   Because it's interesting here is
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.920]   not only does he say that he is the light of the world,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:50.680]   in Matthew, it also says you are the light of the world.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   Jesus himself, after declaring he is the light of the world,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.280]   then says, actually, you know what followers of me,
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.200]   you are the light of the world.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.760]   A city set on a hill cannot be hidden,
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.440]   nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket,
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:08.320]   but on a stand and it gives light to all in the house.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.720]   In the same way, let your light shine before others
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.040]   so that they may see your good works
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.680]   and give glory to your father who is in heaven.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.840]   So whilst Jesus has just declared to them
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.640]   and to all of us right now,
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.040]   I am the light of the world,
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.600]   both past, present and future,
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:31.280]   you also are the light of the world right now.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.400]   You are the light of the world right now.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.720]   You see, we are all agreed that we live in a dark time.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.320]   But yet the question really isn't,
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.520]   oh, we're living in a dark time, how can we save ourselves?
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.720]   The question is, why has God placed us here?
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.840]   The question is, why has God allowed us
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.120]   for such a time as this to be living here in Hong Kong,
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.720]   where it does seemingly seem to be getting darker?
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.120]   But then the question isn't, God, what am I doing here?
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.760]   The question is, God, are you here and what can I do?
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.240]   You are the light of the world.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.240]   And then you've said that I am the light of the world.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.080]   You living in me.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.200]   Now I'm supposed to let my light shine before others
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.880]   so they'll see your good works
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.000]   and give glory to your father in heaven.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.760]   But we shouldn't be strapped with fear
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.920]   going back to that point, we must look different.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.560]   And this is where we as the church need to repent.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.400]   We need to reflect.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.800]   What has God allowed us to do here right now?
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.560]   What is he calling us to do?
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.920]   When he's telling us that we are the light of the world,
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.280]   what does he need us to do?
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.920]   Because we must be different.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:41.920]   Because we are children of God without blemish,
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.720]   living in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.040]   among whom we shine as lights in the world.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.320]   So let them see our good works
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.200]   and give glory to our father in heaven.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.720]   I'll finish with this other passage
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.600]   that I've been reflecting on in the book of Mark 4.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.200]   Jesus, after doing some miracles,
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.960]   then tells them, "Hey, let's go to the other side.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:07.800]   Let's go into the lake."
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.400]   And then he's setting them up really.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.880]   They go into the boat and they go into the lake.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.920]   He takes a nap.
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:13.760]   And then what happens?
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.960]   The storm kicks off and they freak out
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.840]   and they don't know what to do.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.880]   And then they go to him and go,
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.680]   "Jesus, don't you care about us?
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.640]   We're gonna die.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.360]   You're gonna let us die?"
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:26.000]   And then of course he wakes up from his nap
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.240]   and then he says, "Peace, be still."
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.400]   And he rebukes the wind of waves
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.000]   and it all completely stops.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.640]   And you know, I was mulling that over
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.480]   and recently someone revealed to me
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.240]   something that I'd never actually seen before
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.120]   in that passage.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.120]   You can go to if you want to Mark 4,
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.480]   that story of Jesus climbing the storm.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.720]   I think it's verse 36.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.160]   I'm looking it up.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.160]   And it says this.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.000]   And so they get in the boat and they go into the lake.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.680]   And then there's this few words and it says,
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:52.760]   "And there were other boats there also."
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:56.400]   And I just froze when someone revealed that to me.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.240]   I was like,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.040]   man, I'm like the disciples of Jesus
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.040]   who were on that boat and freaking out at Jesus.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.600]   Saying, "Why don't you care about us?
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.160]   Why aren't you helping us?
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.160]   We're gonna die.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.040]   Don't you care?"
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.000]   I'm so engrossed in my own thing,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.480]   in my own survival.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:18.880]   And I neglected to see that actually on that lake,
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.680]   there are other boats as well.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:25.120]   Can you imagine the people in those other boats,
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.080]   believers, the church, followers of Christ?
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.040]   Can you imagine?
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:34.920]   Do you think about the people in those other boats?
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.000]   If we were freaking out and we had Jesus in our boat,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.160]   can you imagine what they're going through?
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.960]   So here's the thing.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.800]   We have Jesus in our boat.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.320]   We should not be afraid.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.640]   But he's now calling us saying,
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.840]   "Hey, look, I am the light of the world
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.160]   and you've seen how I live.
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.520]   I need you to do the same.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.360]   In the same way, let your light shine before others
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.640]   because there are so many out there
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.280]   who do not have me in their boat."
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.640]   And believers, let our hearts break for that.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.520]   The panic that we feel,
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.640]   again, it's not wrong that we feel this anxiety,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.880]   but let us take that to Jesus and say,
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:16.400]   "Jesus, I completely trust in you.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.520]   Help me look different.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.400]   Help me to be your child and in this world
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.840]   and still be able to shine your light
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:25.120]   because I know that there are other people out there
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.200]   who are really afraid, who don't know you,
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.000]   who don't have you in their boats.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.400]   Let us be different."
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.400]   And that's the thing that I've been encouraging myself to do
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.320]   that I've been encouraging myself.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.200]   What can we do during a time like this?
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:41.960]   My prayer is that any interaction I have,
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.600]   any conversation I have,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.400]   any walk I get to go on with someone,
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.760]   any lunch I get to meet someone,
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.800]   let me be different.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:52.440]   Let me shine his light.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.240]   Let me not join in in the grumbling.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.640]   Let me not join in in the fear-mongering.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.720]   Let me shine his light
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.120]   because I recognize how big a deal that is,
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.720]   that he is the light of the world
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.680]   in the very beginning and he will be at the very end.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.600]   And we are assured of that reality.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:17.400]   So let us live now and be in the light of the world here
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.720]   in the lives that God has placed us in,
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.680]   in this city that he's placed us in.
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.320]   Let us be the light of the world
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.880]   so that others may see our good works,
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.800]   the others may see how we live
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:32.120]   and give glory to our Father who is in heaven.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.760]   Because I read this, I saw this online
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.240]   and it was just a kind of funny meme
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.200]   that really got me thinking.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.160]   It's like, we all keep saying we're in the same boat.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.560]   And the meme was, actually, no,
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.680]   we're not all in the same boat.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   We're all in the same storm,
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.360]   but we're all in different boats.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.600]   So have some compassion on people.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:53.000]   We are all in the same storm,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.600]   but we are not all in the same boat.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.600]   Jesus is in our boat.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.640]   So let's get our acts together.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.960]   Let's understand who he is and that he can be trusted.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.080]   And let us help those who are in the boats
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.720]   where they don't have him in.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:13.480]   Let the church arise, let the church wake up
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.320]   to the fact that we are placed here for a reason.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.600]   And let us not lose heart
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:22.280]   because whilst our outer selves are wasting away,
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.560]   our inner selves are being renewed day by day
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.160]   by the light of the world.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.640]   So the light momentary afflictions here are nothing
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.040]   compared to the eternal weight of the glory that awaits.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.040]   Let us hold that light, however small right now,
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.200]   and pray that the spirit would protect our small light
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   and allow it to shine,
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.760]   just as those children sing that song.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.360]   Let this light shine.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.200]   Let me pray.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:53.520]   Jesus, we bow before you.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.360]   You are the light of the world.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.160]   It's in you we live and move and have our being.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.280]   You give us life.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.680]   And yet so often we just live just in fear.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:08.840]   Forgive us, Lord.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.440]   Forgive us 'cause we've forgotten the magnitude
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.560]   of who you are.
[00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.520]   Even the wind and the waves,
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.520]   even COVID waves will obey you.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.320]   And yet right now our duty, our job is to forgive.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.200]   Our job is to just turn our eyes to you,
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.400]   to put our faith in you.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:33.360]   And Jesus, we open ourselves up to you.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.120]   If there is any darkness in us,
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:39.640]   will you shine your light into the parts of our hearts
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:42.720]   where you are not and cleanse us from the inside out
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.520]   and show us the way to walk now, reveal to us the path.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:53.280]   And Lord, re-instill a hope in us,
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:58.280]   a faith in us where we keep our eyes on what is to come,
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.920]   the future that is to come.
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.280]   We may not know what tomorrow holds,
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.320]   but we know the one who holds tomorrow.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:08.920]   We know the one who was there at the very beginning
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.600]   and will be there at the very end.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.120]   Fill us with hope, fill us with your light
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.160]   and let us not cover our own light, have it hidden.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:21.160]   Let our light shine.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.160]   (soft music)
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.560]   (indistinct)
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.960]   (indistinct)
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.360]   (indistinct)
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.760]   (indistinct)
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.340]   (gentle music)
