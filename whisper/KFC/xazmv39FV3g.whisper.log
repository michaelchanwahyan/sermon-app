[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Good night, everyone.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Good night.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   I almost wanted to say, all right, good night, we're done.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   All right, let's do it again.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   All right, not yet nighttime, but it is nighttime.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I'm so excited to be sharing the word of God with you tonight.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Now, you know one thing that can really damage us is how we feel about ourselves.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Now, we can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.

[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.

[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.

[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.

[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   We can't be happy about ourselves.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.760]   It's judgmental, it's critical, it's finger pointing.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.840]   And yet, this is not the world that God wants for us.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.160]   What is God's kingdom for us?
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.680]   Is for acceptance and grace in the midst of our imperfections.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.120]   And that's why we need Jesus.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.480]   And so today we're going to look at Mary Magdalene and how Jesus interacted with her so that
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.080]   we can understand.
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.880]   How is it that he has accepted her so that we can be accepted by him as well and that
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.280]   we can extend that acceptance to other people around us.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.360]   Now who is Mary Magdalene anyways?
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.760]   Well, she has appeared in the gospel for 12 times.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.080]   And she was most likely called Magdalene because she lived in Magdala.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.920]   And it is in the western side.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.040]   If you like, here's a map for those who like maps.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.480]   It's on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.680]   And people used to call themselves by where they live so that we can differentiate which
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.720]   Mary it is.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.340]   And there are quite a few in the Bible.
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.840]   And so from Luke 8, let's look at it together where the beginning of when we hear about
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.840]   Mary.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:39.040]   Now in Luke 8 verse 1 to 3 it says here, "Jesus traveled about from one town and village to
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.320]   another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:51.320]   The 12 were with him and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.760]   Mary called Magdalene from whom seven demons had come out.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.800]   Joanna, the wife of Chuza, and the manager of Harold's household.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.760]   Susanna and many others.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.800]   These women were helping to support them out of their own means."
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.000]   Now interesting to note that Jesus actually didn't always just traveled with his disciples.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.440]   In this case, he traveled with a bunch of women as well.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   And who are these women?
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.760]   They have been healed and delivered from Jesus of demons or different diseases.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.480]   But none of them were spelled out except the one that Mary Magdalene.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.120]   And she was possessed by seven demons.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.360]   That's what we know about her.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.000]   Now they were not there just to watch and learn from Jesus.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.280]   They were there actually to provide for him.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.500]   And Mary Magdalene was one of them.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.120]   Now can you imagine, does anybody have any idea what it's like to be demon possessed?
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.000]   Okay.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.600]   None of us have had that experience.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.040]   And we wonder what does that look like?
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.640]   Well if we reference to other gospels, we're going to see that there had been two demon
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.000]   possessed men recorded before.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.520]   And they were violent.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   And they were out of their mind.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.440]   They even slashed themselves and they were not wearing any clothes.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.880]   And they were yelling out all the time.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:24.000]   So what we do find is that those who are demon possessed most likely had an external manifestation.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.240]   Somebody knew that that person was demon possessed.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.920]   So it wasn't like an internal issue.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.000]   It was an external one that everyone saw.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.960]   But what was Jesus' heart?
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.200]   Did he despise her?
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.760]   Did he reject her?
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   No.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.000]   We saw that Jesus healed her.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.720]   He had the mercy for her.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.600]   And afterwards allowed her to stay with the rest of them.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.200]   Now he could have easily said, "Oh, I don't want to be associated with someone who had
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.740]   been demon possessed just in case other people thought he was or his disciples was."
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:10.480]   So this brings us to our first point, that Jesus has a heart to accept the rejected by
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.680]   staying close to them.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:19.400]   Now Mary was someone that people probably gossiped around, talked about, maybe in front
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.840]   of her or right behind her back.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.680]   Maybe because of her gender, her social acceptance, or what has happened, the seven demons, you
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.860]   know the person with the seven demons, that's her.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.400]   And people didn't want to be associated with her.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.940]   But Jesus accepted her.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.280]   Why is it that Jesus is able to accept her?
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.900]   Was it because she has done anything right?
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.120]   Probably not.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.960]   It was because Jesus was full of love and compassion.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.440]   Now most of us here, or none of us, has ever been demon possessed.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:05.600]   But all of us probably have had a past or a struggle or some sort of failure.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.440]   Now no doubt when that happens, it'll put a question in our mind.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.240]   Are we good enough?
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.720]   Am I really that bad?
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.600]   When things are happening, don't those things repeat in your mind?
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.540]   And in case self-doubt wasn't detrimental enough, you know what the demon does?
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:33.040]   He puts a few people, not a lot, you know, just a few people around you.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   And they'll make sure you know what's wrong with you.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.400]   They might blame you, right out say you're not good enough, or even say it's your fault.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.960]   If you didn't do that, this wouldn't have happened.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:48.560]   So whatever it is you're going through, some people might even say maybe she has done something
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.520]   wrong, that's why she was demon possessed.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.520]   But you see, Jesus is not like that.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:02.560]   He doesn't define us by what we're doing or what we're going through or what's happening.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:09.880]   He defines us by the fact that we are sons and daughters of the living God.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.400]   He loves us immensely.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:21.360]   And so when we've received this kind of acceptance, it begs the question, do we extend this kind
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.880]   of acceptance to the people around us?
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.480]   Now like the Pharisees, they're unlike Jesus, right?
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.200]   What do the Pharisees do?
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   They stay away.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.880]   They said, this is an unclean person.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.080]   This person is of low status.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.520]   I don't want to be associated with them.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.240]   Instead, what do they say?
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.480]   Look at me.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.800]   Look at how good I am.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.520]   I can recite the scripture backwards.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.160]   I don't have this issue with this thing.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.040]   I don't have this sickness.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.440]   I'm good.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.560]   I'm better.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:06.480]   So when we have accepted Jesus and see how he has accepted us, we need to be careful
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.280]   and examine our hearts.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.520]   Are we standing in a place of judgment for others?
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.040]   Now growing up, I was never a popular kid.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.040]   I often spoke my ideas and they might be disregarded.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.760]   I didn't quite have it together.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:31.560]   My father passed away when I was nine, and I was fatherless since then.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.840]   And I immigrated to Canada.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.040]   I think I only spoke 10 words of English when I arrived.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.920]   I wasn't fluent for sure.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:46.120]   And I wasn't sporty enough, and I definitely wasn't tall enough to play any sports where
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:50.000]   people might actually think I'm good at it.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.200]   And really for the longest time, I was single.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.800]   And even after getting married, it took so much effort to make things work.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:05.960]   And even as a pastor, I'm a female, and I'm green.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.160]   I don't have much experience.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.720]   I don't have it all together.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:17.400]   And sometimes I too struggle with feeling accepted.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:27.440]   And yet, whenever it is that I turn to my father in heaven, I know that I'm fully accepted
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.760]   for who I am.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.000]   Is it because I'm perfect?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Definitely not.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.440]   It is only because he loves me.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.760]   And I want to say that's the same thing for you.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.160]   No matter what it is that you're going through or has been going through, don't let that
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.000]   be a stigma.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.080]   He doesn't define you by those things.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:57.640]   He defines you because he loves you and has fully accepted you.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.400]   And I'm so thankful that in my life, there has been other people who have exemplified
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.960]   that kind of acceptance.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.960]   Of course, you know, he's already patting on his shoulder.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.760]   How do you know this, Charles?
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.640]   Pastor John's one of them.
[00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.640]   Sandra.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.120]   Whenever I might be in self-doubt, they give me that big hug that I think my bones are
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.160]   going to crush sometimes.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.320]   And even when I'm not doubting, they give me that hug.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.720]   Or I have my seminary teacher.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.160]   And whenever I go to him, I'm like, I'm not sure about this.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.160]   He would guide me.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.600]   He would help me.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.280]   Even though I've graduated two years, I think he must be thinking, wow, this person never
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.920]   going to stop coming.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   I'm sure not.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.920]   I'm sure not.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:51.400]   He's very thankful and just accepting of where I am.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:56.600]   And of course, there are many of you guys too that I'm able to connect.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:02.680]   And you've asked me out for dinners, going over to your places, and just connect.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.040]   You would invite me, my husband, Isabella.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.480]   We'll all go.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.600]   And by the way, if you invite my extended family, I'll bring them all over too.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.040]   And I really sense that acceptance.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:23.080]   I want to say we all need people around us to accept us.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.800]   And sometimes we might be the one that's struggling.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.520]   We can go to God.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:35.120]   But at the same time, we can be that person that tells other people that, hey, we accept
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.120]   you.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.600]   We see where you are, and we love you.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.080]   We can be that person for other people.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:50.520]   And so let us accept those who are rejected or feeling rejected by staying close to them.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:55.880]   Now as we read on, there's another record of Mary Magdalene in the gospel.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:02.680]   And it is in John chapter 20, where Mary alone experiences the first and the most profound
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.080]   moment where she sees the resurrected Jesus.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:12.640]   Now it was right after that Jesus was crucified, and he was laid in his tomb.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.640]   And it was dark that night, and Mary went there.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.480]   And she was trying to see Jesus.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.520]   But she saw that the tombstone was open.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.760]   So he ran straight to his disciples.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.520]   Simon, Peter, and another person, most likely disciple John.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.640]   And what happened was they all rushed over to see what happened.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:37.780]   And when they saw that the tombstone was open, they believed.
[00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.360]   And the disciples went back to where they were.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.600]   But Mary stayed there, and she was weeping.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.580]   And that's where the scripture that we heard Bonnie read earlier.
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.440]   She was crying in the tomb.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.320]   She doesn't know where the Lord is.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.240]   And yet there are two angels that were inside.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.080]   And they asked her, "Why are you crying?"
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.240]   She said, "I don't know.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.080]   Somebody took Jesus.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:06.120]   Can you tell me where he is?"
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.760]   And so let's read this together.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.000]   John 20, from verse 14 to 18.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.400]   At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.400]   This is Mary.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.540]   But she did not realize that it was Jesus.
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.560]   He asked her, "Women, why are you crying?
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.080]   Who is it that you're looking for?"
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:35.600]   "Thinking he was a gardener," she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.760]   you have put him, and I will get him."
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.900]   Jesus said to her, "Mary."
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:48.960]   She turned towards him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni," which means "teacher."
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:55.320]   Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:02.100]   Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father,
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.560]   to my God and your God.'"
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:08.440]   Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.940]   "I have seen the Lord."
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.620]   And she told them that he had said these things to her.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:22.020]   You see, Mary Magdalene, she was crying and thought Jesus was the gardener.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.700]   Who would have taken Jesus, she thought.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.500]   But Jesus told her, as he says, "Mary."
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:33.620]   She recognizes him right away.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.500]   Now this verse, one verse is a little bit hard.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.300]   Why is it that Jesus has told her, "Don't hold on to me yet, for I have not ascended
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.300]   to the Father."
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.300]   What does that mean?
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:52.220]   Well, it's likely because Jesus' permanent form has not come about yet.
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:57.380]   And she's telling her in this spiritual sense, "Don't hold on to this current me.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.480]   I'm going to come back with a permanent form.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.820]   You cannot hold on to what it is now.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:05.280]   Things will change."
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:10.880]   And this dialogue, what we see is Jesus accepting someone in sorrow.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:15.380]   He was definitely finishing off a very important mission.
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:21.600]   FYI, salvation is a very important mission.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.960]   He has already finished crucifixion.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:29.300]   He has risen, but he did not go to the Father yet to come back.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:36.980]   And yet, he's willing to stop for someone, someone very special.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.000]   Mary Magdalene, who was in sorrow.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.620]   And so this brings us to our second point, that Jesus has a heart to accept the sorrowful
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.000]   by empathizing with them.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.480]   You know, it's one thing to care for someone, but it's another thing to accept their sorrow.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:02.400]   Now in this age and time, we're probably too busy, too unempathetic towards people who
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.880]   are in pain.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:11.360]   And a lot of times what we'll say is, "I'll pray for you, and then we'll leave."
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.520]   And a lot of times, even when people are in sorrow, we might be judging them and think,
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   "What's wrong?
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.320]   It's only a small matter.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.140]   Why are you crying over this?"
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.780]   And anybody in your situation, they'll take care of it like that.
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.280]   What is wrong with you?
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:36.080]   Do we have that empathetic sense to be feeling where they're feeling?
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.160]   And obviously, you know, for Jesus, he already knows what's going to happen, right?
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.760]   He knows in about a few days' time, he's going to come back.
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.160]   You know, if I were Jesus, maybe I'll go like, "Okay, I know she's crying, but it'll only
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.480]   be for a few more days.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.520]   Let me finish off this really important mission.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.680]   I'll come back."
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.480]   But Jesus is not like that.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:07.800]   In your most painful moment, he stops everything for you because he accepts your sorrow, and
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.880]   he's not going to judge that.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:18.360]   And so when we're in pain, even if no one understands, we know we can go to him and
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.840]   he will accept us.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.440]   You know, emotions doesn't have right or wrong.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.220]   It's just there.
[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:31.120]   And the difference between empathy and sympathy, I think we've talked about it before, but
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:36.280]   I want to say it again, is because empathy is really being in another person's shoes
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:42.080]   and trying to feel what they're feeling, not being in their shoes and feeling what you
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.000]   think they're feeling.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.560]   You're trying to feel that.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:50.000]   And sympathy really is just saying, "I have pity, and you know what?
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.840]   I'm thankful it's not happening to me."
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.440]   Sympathy.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:00.800]   And so here we see that the heart of Jesus is to accept.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.300]   Now one of my best friend, and she's here tonight, but I won't point her out.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.740]   She doesn't like it.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.960]   She always empathizes with me when I'm in sorrow.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.920]   Whenever I'm in my deepest sorrow, I go to her and I cry.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.040]   And sometimes I'm surprised because we might be praying, and by the time I open my eyes,
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.220]   she's crying as well.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.000]   And when I'm angry, she's angry with me.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.680]   And we can be angry together.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.800]   No angry birds, right?
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:38.920]   And in front of her, I never felt for a moment that my tears would be judged or my frustrations
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:46.240]   would be judged, because she accepted that in that moment, that's what I felt.
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.040]   And I feel like we can all be like that for someone.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:56.320]   Rather than just accepting how God accepts our feelings and emotions, would we also be
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.960]   that person for someone else?
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.300]   Don't judge.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:06.320]   Don't say, "Well, you've brought it onto yourself, so there you go."
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.660]   No.
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.800]   Just try to feel what they're feeling.
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.000]   And as a new mom, that's sometimes not easy for me.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.320]   And there has been nights where I get my milk bottle ready.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.000]   My little one back there, in case you don't know, it's six months old.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.260]   Her name is Isabella.
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.880]   And I would try to give her the milk, and she won't have it.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.160]   I put it in her mouth, and she goes like...
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.160]   She's really good at dodging.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.920]   So one day, I think she can play dodgeball or something.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.300]   So she dodges it.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.300]   And there I am.
[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.400]   And this is 1 AM.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.160]   In my head, I'm thinking, "All right.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.880]   Mommy's only doing this not because it's fun, but I want you to grow up nice and strong
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.280]   and tall, okay?"
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.600]   So there I am doing this the whole time I'm thinking this.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.600]   And I'm like, "You know what?
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.800]   Let's have this milk so we can both go to bed, okay?"
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.040]   And so just when I'm about to say it, I swallow it back down.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.960]   Because I'm thinking, "I'm not this baby.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:16.320]   Do I remember or know what it feels like to be eating only one kind of food for six months?
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.480]   Does anybody remember what it feels like to only drink milk for six months?"
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.500]   I know we've all done it, but none of us remember.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.920]   And so even as a baby, when she can't speak, I'm trying to sympathize with her that in
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.040]   this moment in time, I don't want milk.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.400]   And so I'll be, "Okay, no milk.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.400]   Let's go to bed."
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.400]   And maybe I said goodnight at the very beginning.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.720]   And I wonder, can we sympathize with the people around us?
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:52.440]   And I'm not saying we need to do that for everybody, because some people can really
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:57.360]   talk and talk and talk and talk, and we can't.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.480]   But can we start with the people around us first?
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.920]   What about our parents when they're upset?
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.320]   Like, "Why are you still staying up?"
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.160]   They're like, "I don't care.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.600]   Just let me do my thing."
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:15.680]   Will we for a moment sympathize, not sympathize, empathize with them?
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.360]   They love me so much.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:23.160]   Or when our spouse, when they're crying, instead of like, "Okay, I have to go watch TV and
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.400]   just ignore."
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.880]   Can we just stay there and say, "Hey, what are you feeling?
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.340]   Tell me all about it."
[00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.280]   And same thing when it's our child.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:39.840]   Maybe we've said something to anger them, and they look like they're very upset about
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.840]   it.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.640]   Are we just gonna ignore it or try to feel what they're feeling?
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:48.280]   What is it that I have said that has upset you?
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.800]   Would we do that?
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:57.360]   Now from the same passage in John, we see that there's also an interesting countercultural
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.240]   action that Jesus has done.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:06.440]   Jesus said to Mary in verse seven, "Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:12.560]   to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:20.640]   Now this good news about the risen Lord was actually given to a woman.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:30.400]   Now not only any woman, but a woman who has once been possessed by seven demons.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:37.520]   And it shows that God is not showing partiality, that he's willing to commission whosoever
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.020]   heart is pointed towards Jesus.
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:49.000]   So this brings us to our third point, that Jesus' heart to accept even the lowly by commissioning
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   them.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.080]   Of all the people in the world that you would choose to be the first person to see the resurrected
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.440]   Jesus, who would it be?
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.200]   I don't know, you may say Peter, John, right?
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.800]   At least pick one of the disciples.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:18.120]   But no, Jesus picked Mary Magdalene, someone with a past, someone who was demon possessed.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.280]   Now this is out of your mind, right?
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.480]   First she was a woman.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480]   And what did that mean?
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.280]   Especially in such a male dominated world.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.400]   It meant that her words were not credible at all.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:38.900]   And at that time, most of the women did not have any education.
[00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:42.400]   So she probably didn't write or read.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.760]   And the third thing, she was demon possessed.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.120]   Now if you were going to say the Lord has risen, does that sound crazy?
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.080]   It sounded pretty crazy.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:56.200]   People might say, "Oh my goodness, she's demon possessed again."
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:06.040]   So why would Jesus still entrust this important message for Mary Magdalene to preach back
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.060]   to the disciples?
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:14.500]   It is because he shows no partiality.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:23.500]   For us humans, we see people by their appearance and see if they're the elite ones.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:28.080]   But God looks at a person's heart.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:33.340]   And so it doesn't matter whatever things you're going through or has been through, if you
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:38.740]   think you're lesser of someone or if someone tells you outright that you're lesser of someone,
[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:41.220]   don't let that discourage you.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:54.100]   As long as you love the Lord, he will commission you no matter what because he sees the heart.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.220]   And so we might fall into the same trap.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:07.140]   As we accept fully from what God accepts us for, do we also extend that acceptance to
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:08.140]   someone else?
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:14.980]   I mean, it's very easy for us to always find the people who seem to have it all together
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.980]   to do this or to do that.
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.420]   Oh, that person, let's not find her.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.820]   Let's not find him.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.940]   It's very easy for us humans to do that.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.980]   But let us be accepting like the Lord.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:32.060]   If that person loves the Lord, let them try.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.060]   Let them do it.
[00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.220]   If they don't have enough of the training or background, let's give it to them.
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:42.460]   And so a few years back, I was serving at a church and something happened.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.980]   So a bunch of people left and I was serving as one of the worship leaders.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.700]   I know I was serving.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.940]   And we didn't have enough people to be there.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.620]   And so I looked around and I saw people who loved the Lord.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:58.640]   They really loved him.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.520]   And they're singing their hearts out every time when we were worshiping.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:07.580]   So I went ahead and I asked, "Hey, would you guys like to be on the worship team?"
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.100]   And they're like, "Can we?"
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.900]   I was like, "Do you love the Lord?"
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.900]   "Yeah."
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.900]   "Do you like to worship?"
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:13.900]   "Yeah."
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.220]   "All right, you're on."
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.220]   But they're not your usual worship team.
[00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:24.540]   Now, I would say all of them were 55 and above.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.100]   And some of them retiring or have retired.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.300]   No musical training.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.300]   Never been on stage.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.860]   They don't know the first thing about worship.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.980]   But you know what?
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:37.900]   They have the heart.
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:38.900]   Let's go for it.
[00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.020]   So I still remember vividly, I got seven of them.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:44.580]   I was teaching them the keyboard.
[00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.940]   And they had these rolled out portable keyboards.
[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.200]   They were so cute doing those.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.060]   And then we had drum lessons we learned together.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:58.540]   And even back then, I've only learned drums for a year.
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.100]   We did it.
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:05.500]   And then everybody-- OK, I have to tell you the reality.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:10.900]   The reality was none of them mastered the keyboards.
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.060]   One person could play the drum.
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.580]   But all of them were able to sing.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:22.340]   And we had these worship nights where it was just spirit-filled.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:27.040]   And I still remember one of them coming to me and saying, "Michelle, thank you so much
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.540]   for trusting us.
[00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.300]   I mean, nobody in a million years would ask us to be on the worship team."
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:42.140]   And I just want to say, God will commission you when your heart loves him.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.900]   He shows no partiality.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.340]   And at the same time, let us learn from him, too.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.260]   Raise up more people.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.300]   Different people can serve in different positions.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.260]   So come forward.
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:57.440]   This is a recruitment process, I think.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.940]   Come forward when that is in your heart.
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:12.220]   So tonight, I just wanted all of us to see how Jesus accepted Mary Magdalene.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:19.340]   She was someone with a past, a female, someone of lower status.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.540]   And yet Jesus accepted her.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.460]   Jesus kept her close.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.420]   Jesus empathized with her sorrow.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:35.060]   And Jesus commissioned her, the very first person.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.180]   And when she was commissioned, you know what that did?
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:45.880]   It was telling the disciples as well, and the whole world to us, that she is no lesser
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:47.820]   than anybody else.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:54.620]   So that even when he were to be in heaven and not physically be on earth, that they
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.740]   would treat her as an equal.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:03.940]   So rather you have failed an exam or didn't get to a school or didn't graduate, or you
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:10.380]   grew up in a single parent home, or you have been battling with illness, whether it's mentally
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:17.100]   or physically, or if you have went through a divorce or if you're going through one,
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:24.540]   if you have struggles with your kids or finances or finding a job, please, don't let that
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.660]   stop you from feeling the acceptance of God.
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.900]   You are not defined by these things.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:33.140]   And I have to say it again.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.620]   You are not defined by these things.
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:44.860]   You are defined by the fact that you are a daughter and a son of God.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:50.460]   You are a son and a daughter of the living God.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:56.380]   And that's your definition.
[00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:06.740]   And so I pray that we will, in times of when we feel unsure or in doubt, reach out to God.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.460]   Let his acceptance fill you up.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:15.020]   And at the same time, accept the people around us.
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.300]   Now in a moment, we're going to sing a response song called "You Say."
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:25.740]   And one line really catches my attention, which is, "Am I really just the sum of my
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:28.540]   highs and lows?"
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.540]   What is your value?
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.220]   How are you defined?
[00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:40.500]   Let us define not by what other people say, not even how you view yourself, but what God
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.340]   says about you.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:50.740]   And he says he loves you, he accepts you, and he'll continue to be with you until the
[00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.780]   end of time.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.900]   Let us pray together.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:07.780]   Dear Heavenly Father, we don't know how you can love us this way.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:13.140]   I think it is because you made us.
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:14.780]   You made us.
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:22.300]   And you love us despite our flaws, our imperfections, and even our sins have been taken care of
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.500]   with the blood of Jesus.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.980]   What more can we ask for from a God?
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:37.620]   And so Father, I pray that, especially for those who are hurting, who don't feel accepted,
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:43.060]   that Father, may your Spirit fill us up.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.860]   It doesn't matter what people say.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.540]   It only matters what you say.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:56.380]   Father, may we hold on to that and also extend that acceptance to the people around us.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.980]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:08.980]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
