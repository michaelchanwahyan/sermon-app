[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.560]   - Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.660]   And we've been going through Beware, Bit Grow.
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.620]   Who's been enjoying 2 Peter?
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.520]   Some really important lessons in 2 Peter.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.520]   And Pastor John kicked us off the first week
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.160]   and he talked about the true Christian, right?
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.360]   The true Christian.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.600]   Oh, it's hard to breathe.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.640]   (laughing)
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.720]   I gotta inhale every time.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.080]   All right.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.760]   Pastor John talked about the true Christian life
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.340]   the first week, right?
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.060]   When a Christian, sorry.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.000]   When a Christian begins with faith
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.200]   and then what happens?
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.060]   There's results, right?
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.040]   There's spiritual growth that happens afterwards.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.840]   And the spiritual growth leads to practical results, right?
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.040]   There are qualities that Peter listed there.
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.120]   It was love, it was goodness, it was knowledge.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.640]   All of these things come about as we become more like God.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.240]   And then Pastor James did a really powerful sermon
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.240]   last week, warning us on the false prophets way of life.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.520]   Right?
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.020]   They are like people, like dogs actually,
[00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.860]   that come back to their own vomit,
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.260]   like freshly washed pigs that roll back into the mud.
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.700]   They are actually slaves to money, sex, and power.
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.560]   They're talking about freedom.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.960]   They wanna live a free life,
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.960]   but they're actually enslaved by their own sensual desires.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.960]   And Peter continues to talk about warnings
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.260]   of the false prophets.
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.300]   And we're gonna read together here, verse three.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.420]   Let's read with me.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.440]   One, two, three.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.680]   "Knowing this, first of all,
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.840]   "that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.880]   "following their own sinful desires.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.580]   "They will say, 'Where is the promise of his coming?'
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.140]   "For where ever since the fathers fell asleep,
[00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.820]   "all things are continuing as they were
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.520]   "from the beginning of creation."
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.360]   Scoffers.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.860]   Peter warns us that scoffers will come.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.960]   And what are scoffers?
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.720]   They're mockers.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.180]   People that insult others.
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.160]   People who laugh at others.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.680]   And in this case, who are they laughing at?
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.580]   Who are they laughing at here?
[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.900]   They're laughing at God, right?
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.700]   Where is this coming, right, that he promised?
[00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.940]   God, where is this coming?
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.580]   And so they have two points that they point out
[00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.140]   that they're mocking and scoffing at.
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.940]   Where is the coming that he promised, which is God?
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.400]   Where is the coming of God that he promised?
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.380]   And his judgment.
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.340]   And his judgment.
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.620]   And the second thing, second point that they point out is,
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.380]   well, we don't see his coming
[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.280]   because everything is the same as it has been
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.860]   since the beginning of creation.
[00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.780]   And one of these people that were really the opponents
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.780]   of Christianity at that time was Epicurus, right?
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.420]   And one of his quotes was, "Death does not concern us
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.440]   "because as long as we exist, death is not here.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.540]   "And when it does come, we no longer exist."
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.260]   And so Epicurus is saying here,
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.580]   "Just live your life, enjoy your pleasures.
[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.940]   "Nothing bad is gonna happen in the end.
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.220]   "And even if it does, we no longer exist.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.600]   "It doesn't matter.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.760]   "There's no judgment in the final days.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.580]   "There's no judgment coming."
[00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.480]   And that's sort of similar to us today, is it not?
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.180]   YOLO, live your life.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.320]   You only live once, right?
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.920]   Go enjoy your best wine, your steak dinners,
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.200]   and who knows, right?
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.300]   Enjoy the things, do the things you wanna do now.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.680]   That's the kind of lifestyle we're living also in today.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.320]   And so Peter offers us some responses to these things.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.680]   And we're gonna look at this together.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.320]   Let's read together verse five.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.340]   For they deliberately overlook this fact
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.000]   that the heavens existed long ago
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.520]   and the earth was formed out of the water
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.280]   and through water by the word of God.
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.360]   And then by the means of these,
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.160]   the world that then existed was divulged
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.120]   with water and perished, deluged, sorry, deluged.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.720]   And then the next verse, by the same word,
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.560]   the heavens and earth that now exist
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.700]   are stored up for a fire, being kept apart
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.820]   until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.620]   Peter's first response is this.
[00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.520]   God spoke and what happened?
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.080]   The world existed.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.540]   God spoke and there was light from the darkness.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.700]   God spoke and land came out of the water.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.100]   God spoke and there was animals.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:12.120]   With his word, God creates.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.480]   With his word, God creates.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.720]   That's his first point.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.100]   The second point is not only does the word of God create,
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.740]   the word of God can also destroy.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.340]   He saw the evil that was in man's heart
[00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.260]   and he said, I will punish this earth, these people,
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.980]   and he sent a flood.
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.340]   And so with his word, he also destroyed.
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.820]   And so these scoffers, they're saying,
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.160]   whoa, there's no judgment, that's not true.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.360]   In the beginning, God created the world
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.240]   and then destroyed it, but then he also restored it.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.300]   There was a sense of restoration afterwards.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.720]   And it says in the last verses that we read in verse seven
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.200]   that the word of God will also purify.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.960]   The day of judgment is coming
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.160]   and the destruction of the ungodly.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.220]   It's interesting 'cause back then,
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.580]   Noah was pleading with the people back then.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.580]   The flood is coming, the flood is coming.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.660]   Look at this huge ark that I built.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.820]   It's massive and somehow it's in Hong Kong now.
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.220]   Come on this boat, a flood is coming.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.140]   And you guys are just sitting on the beach in Repulse Bay,
[00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.460]   kicking the football around at Wan Chai Stadium
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.180]   and enjoying a great time eating and dining in Central.
[00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.920]   And then Noah's saying, the flood is coming,
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.620]   judgment is coming.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.900]   And they're just laughing, scoffers, mockers, right?
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.520]   Like Noah, you must be a crazy man.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.360]   You know, you may have had too much wine
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.740]   or some too many dinner wines with Pastor John.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.860]   Is it not the same that back then
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.540]   they were also laughing at God, laughing at Noah?
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.040]   Where is this judgment?
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.660]   And then all of a sudden the rains came
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.840]   and judgment was there and God closed the door himself.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.480]   God closed the door himself, judgment came.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:38.580]   We continue in verse eight
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.820]   and we continue to see his response.
[00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.500]   Let's read together.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.700]   But do not overlook this one fact, beloved.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.940]   Let's read together.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.060]   That with the Lord, one day is as a thousand years
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.080]   and a thousand years as one day.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.160]   The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.220]   as some count slowness, but is patient toward you,
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.900]   not wishing that any of you should perish,
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.640]   but all of you should reach repentance.
[00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.460]   Peter's fifth response is that the word of God
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.660]   is sustaining us.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:19.220]   The reason why we can breathe,
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.960]   the reason why we can take each breath,
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.240]   that there's oxygen in the air,
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:28.740]   is because God, the word of God allows it.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.820]   The reason why you can enjoy the goodness
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:37.820]   of the things on the earth is because God has allowed it.
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.160]   He sustains the world.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.480]   He is the I am.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.920]   He is present.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.540]   He's in the past.
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.760]   He's not just a God that existed in the past,
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.480]   in the present, he is a God that is the I am,
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.820]   he is present.
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:02.820]   We see time as linear, continuously going forward.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.780]   He sees it as a whole.
[00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:09.200]   He is the great I am.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.060]   And Peter also says that we have
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:17.060]   a limited perspective of time, limited perspective.
[00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.740]   And we're gonna see in the next picture here,
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.260]   you know, because of all these Zoom things,
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.420]   you know, we do these Zoom games, right?
[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.300]   This Zoom game is called, you know,
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.180]   Zoom in and Zoom out, right?
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.460]   What do you guys think this is?
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.020]   Take a guess.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.220]   Any of you know?
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.700]   It looks like a mountain and with two eyes.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.600]   Is it like a square puff thing?
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.480]   I don't know, character?
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.100]   What is it?
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.480]   Go on, book church logo, who got it?
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.940]   It's a Go on, book church, who got it?
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.220]   Who knew right away?
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.020]   Michelle, yeah, Agnes, yeah, maybe, okay.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.000]   Carmen, very good.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.540]   These people all work at church.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.400]   They stare at it every day.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.860]   But if we Zoom in just like before, we didn't know.
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.260]   Only like 1% of you knew.
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.740]   Anthony, how long have you been in this church?
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:09.820]   Did you know?
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.500]   You didn't know.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.300]   We have a limited perspective of time.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.100]   And that is what God is saying.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.580]   Peter is saying here that God sees everything
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.980]   and we are so limited.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:27.860]   And Peter says this, in fact,
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.340]   that the reason why God is allowing these things to happen
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.460]   and that God's judgment has not come yet
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.620]   is because he is patient.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:40.320]   He's patient with you.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.720]   He's patient with you.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.860]   He knows your weakness.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.580]   He knows your friends that have not come to know Jesus yet.
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.580]   And he's giving them time to repent.
[00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.220]   God is not slow.
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.020]   But God is patient.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.300]   God is patient.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.860]   The last response that Peter has is this.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.120]   Let's read together.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.780]   One, two, three.
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.900]   But the day of the Lord will come like a thief,
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.460]   and then the heavens will pass away with a roar,
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.100]   and the heavenly bodies will be burned and dissolved,
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.700]   and the earth and the works that are done in it
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.740]   will be exposed.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.660]   The day of the Lord.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.980]   The day of the Lord.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.340]   It was prophesied in the Old Testament
[00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.040]   that the day of the Lord will come.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.860]   Jesus talks about it,
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.940]   that the day of the Lord,
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.940]   the end times will come like a thief.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.020]   And Peter's response is this,
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.100]   that there are three things that are gonna happen
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.780]   in the day of the Lord, the judgment day of the Lord.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.420]   The first thing is that the heavens will pass away
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.520]   with a roar.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.460]   Then the elements will be dissolved by fire.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.580]   And the earth, finally,
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.340]   the earth and all that has been done in it
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.820]   will be disclosed or discovered or exposed.
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.700]   So what is this?
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.180]   What does this all mean?
[00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.260]   It's very sort of figurative and metaphorical.
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.420]   What does it all mean?
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.060]   Well, the heavens will pass away.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.140]   We know that Jesus also talked about it as well,
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.020]   that the moon will turn into blood.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.020]   In Revelations, we see right here,
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.740]   the sun turns black,
[00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.540]   the moon turned to blood red,
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.540]   the skies fell to the earth.
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:39.660]   The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up
[00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:44.360]   and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.500]   So firstly, we see that when Peter says
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.460]   that the heavens will pass away,
[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.660]   he literally means probably the stars
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.500]   and the sun and the heavens,
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.700]   it will pass away like a scroll.
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.980]   And then he also talks about the elements here.
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.900]   What are the elements that are dissolved by fire?
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.340]   Well, there are actually several meanings
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.440]   to the word elements.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.740]   The first, it could be the elements of the earth,
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.280]   the universe, right?
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.340]   Earth, air, fire, water, right?
[00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.780]   It could be that.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.580]   Or it could also be that he's quoting Isaiah 34, four,
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.700]   which says that all the stars in the sky will be dissolved
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.740]   and the heavens rolled up like a scroll.
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.840]   All the starry hosts will fall
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.580]   like withered leaves from the vine,
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.540]   like shriveled figs from a fig tree.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.900]   Basically, what he's saying here
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.580]   is that in the day of the Lord,
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.580]   the heavens, the skies will be rolled up like a scroll.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.800]   Imagine it, the earth, the clouds,
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.460]   everything rolled up like a scroll.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.440]   And then the earth is exposed.
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.480]   The earth is exposed, laid bare,
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.140]   and God's judgment will come.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.140]   Nothing will get in the way of the judgment of God.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.320]   Nothing will get in the way.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.720]   And we see from this, from Peter's response here,
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.100]   that God's purpose is not to destroy the earth.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:32.260]   God's purpose is to renew the earth,
[00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:37.860]   cleanse the earth of the ungodliness and sin
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:43.720]   so that there would be a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.540]   a new heaven and a new earth.
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.760]   One that is without sin,
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.960]   one that is made whole and new again.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.740]   And my question to you today is,
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.740]   do you believe that God will one day judge the earth?
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.660]   That one day he will come
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:11.020]   and that one day he will make everything new,
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:15.420]   that there will be a new heaven and a new earth?
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.420]   Who believes it?
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.660]   Raise your hand.
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.120]   Yeah, everybody here?
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.240]   Most people?
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.080]   Very good.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:24.900]   Let me just sum up what we've learned
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:27.180]   in 2 Peter so far.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.620]   So Pastor John talked about the true Christian
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.260]   and then James talked about the first warning,
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.940]   the prophet's way of life.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:38.120]   And then I just went through the prophet's wrong theology,
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.300]   that there's no second coming,
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.700]   that there's no judgment, right?
[00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.460]   And then we will see in the next couple of verses,
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.100]   we saw Peter's response,
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.940]   and next we will see how to live as a true Christian
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:56.180]   in the last days.
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:00.500]   How do we live as a true Christian in the last days?
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.980]   And so let's continue to read verse 11 together.
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.380]   One, two, three.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.740]   Since all these things are thus to be dissolved,
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:11.020]   what sort of people ought you to live
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.180]   in lives of holiness and godliness,
[00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.340]   waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of the Lord,
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.060]   because of which the heavens will be set on fire
[00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.300]   and dissolved,
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.900]   and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn?
[00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:27.720]   But according to his promise,
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.840]   we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.420]   in which his righteousness dwells.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.500]   And so Peter begs the question,
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.820]   if all these things are to be dissolved
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.180]   and the earth is supposed to be cleansed
[00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:45.580]   and there should be a new heaven and a new earth,
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.940]   what kind of people should we be?
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:52.220]   What kind of people should we be?
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.260]   And I don't have time to go through everything together.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.720]   I'm just gonna sum it up a little bit here.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.580]   The first thing he tells us
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.700]   is that we need to have character.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.500]   We need to have character.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.860]   And he mentioned it in verse 11,
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.860]   that we need to live lives of holiness and godliness.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.980]   And what is holiness?
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.140]   Holiness is that we are set apart for his thing,
[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.620]   for his glory, for his purposes.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:26.860]   We are to be set apart.
[00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.020]   In verse 14, as we'll see later,
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.980]   we are to be spotless and blameless.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:35.180]   And so in our character,
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.900]   if God is really coming and we are in the last days,
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.220]   how should we live?
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:45.220]   We should live holy lives, spotless lives.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.940]   And how do we do that?
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.100]   How do we do that?
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.180]   We have to live according to his word.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.780]   We have to live according to his word.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:00.600]   It's so hard nowadays with all the temptations.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.980]   You walk down the subway and you might see an advertisement
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.060]   that causes you to be in temptation.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:11.100]   A couple clicks on your phone and you can be in temptation.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.220]   It's such a challenge now,
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.220]   especially in the last days, to be holy.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:25.080]   And how do you be holy when everything,
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.040]   there's a spotlight on each one of us at times?
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:32.460]   You know, it's been sad to see some
[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.740]   of these Christian leaders that we've looked upon
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:42.740]   and they've fallen and they haven't lived in holiness,
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:45.300]   spotless and blameless.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.540]   It's not easy.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:51.620]   There's so much temptation, so much challenge nowadays.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:56.340]   The second thing that Peter tells us
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.660]   is that we have to watch our actions in the last days.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.820]   These are the last days.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:07.560]   He tells us that we need to hasten the coming of the Lord.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.340]   Another interpretation of that
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.220]   is speed the coming of the Lord.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.700]   Well, how do you speed the coming of the Lord?
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:17.660]   You know, how do you like, do you put the,
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:18.980]   you know, pedal to the metal?
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:20.800]   You know, how do you do it?
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.900]   There's several things that can speed
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.060]   the coming of the Lord.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.260]   Evangelism, as you share the gospel,
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.900]   as you share the message of hope,
[00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:36.580]   you are speeding his coming because Jesus prophesied
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:41.220]   all the earth will hear of the gospel
[00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.060]   and then the end shall come.
[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.100]   And then the end shall come.
[00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:49.340]   You can read that in the gospels.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.820]   As we pray, as we pray that his kingdom come,
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.980]   we are speeding the coming of the Lord.
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.980]   As we are serving one another,
[00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.740]   building up the body of Christ,
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.380]   building up his kingdom,
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.820]   as we are serving the homeless, the needy,
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.900]   the Napoli street cleaners,
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.160]   the local school kids and teaching them English
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.900]   and teaching them Bible stories on Saturday,
[00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.220]   we are speeding the coming of the Lord
[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.780]   'cause his word is being known.
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:27.780]   Our action is to speed the coming of the Lord.
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.900]   And we are also to grow in the grace of the Lord.
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.660]   We need to be like Jesus.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:40.820]   How did Jesus show grace?
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.420]   He touched the leper.
[00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.380]   Nobody wanted to.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.740]   They had their own separate room, right?
[00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.740]   It was roommate, right?
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.680]   I'm joking.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.820]   They had their own room that Jesus touched the leper.
[00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:57.180]   Jesus ate with the tax collector.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.540]   And the sinners.
[00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.420]   Jesus talked to the prostitute.
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.740]   Let the prostitute put oil.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.540]   You know, Mary Magdalene put oil on him.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.860]   Or adulterer, right?
[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.420]   Everybody wanted to stone the adulterer,
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.980]   but he said, "He who is without sin,
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.460]   "let him cast the first stone."
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.860]   We need to be growing in the grace of Jesus.
[00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.140]   How is your action today?
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:33.780]   In these last time, what is your actions?
[00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.320]   Is it speeding the coming of the Lord?
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.940]   The next thing he said is our trust.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.100]   Our trust that God's judgment is coming.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.800]   One day he will return.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.460]   Our trust is that God will cleanse the earth.
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.100]   Everything will be made new.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.160]   There will be a new heaven and a new earth.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.160]   God will come.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.280]   God will do as he promised.
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.140]   He is a man of his word.
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.780]   He is a God of his word.
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.260]   We're gonna skip a couple of verses
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.860]   and go to verse 17.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.580]   Verse 17.
[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.620]   Let's read that together.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.060]   One, two, three.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.900]   "Therefore, dear friends,
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.900]   "since you have been forewarned,
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.760]   "be on your guard so that you may not be carried away
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.600]   "by the error of the lawless
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:27.620]   "and fall from your secure position.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.900]   "But grow in the grace and knowledge
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.700]   "of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.880]   "To him be the glory, both now and forever.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.820]   "Amen."
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:41.980]   Peter continues and says, "Be on your guard."
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.020]   Be on your guard.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:46.940]   And last week, Pastor John warned us.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:52.100]   There's these people, these groups of people
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.300]   coming after the youth specifically.
[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.300]   We need to be on our guard.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.580]   And Peter says this specifically here.
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:04.380]   Do not be carried away by the error of the lawless,
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:09.580]   or you will fall from your secured position.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:14.160]   Our position in Christ.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:20.820]   We need to be on guard.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.140]   Be careful.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.060]   Be careful of the heresies that are out there,
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.300]   of those who lead people astray.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:36.100]   There are people that are preaching false testimonies.
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.660]   We need to be aware.
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:44.980]   And lastly, he shared this, our knowledge.
[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.420]   Our knowledge.
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.860]   We need to grow in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.420]   And he also sums up, all the apostles agree.
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.340]   Even Paul, right?
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.660]   He mentions that specifically.
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:06.380]   How do we know how to defend ourselves from heresy
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.500]   if we don't know the word of God?
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:13.660]   If you don't know the truth, how can you tell?
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:14.580]   You can't.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:20.540]   You must dig deep into the word of God.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.260]   Grow in our knowledge of him.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.540]   And so Peter is challenging us
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:30.180]   as Christians in the last times,
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.280]   and these are the last times, last days,
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:39.820]   that we need to be living as true Christians.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:44.820]   And true Christians are spotless, holy in their character.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.060]   They strive for holiness and spotlessness
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.700]   in their character, as we see in the next slide.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.220]   He's challenging our action.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.820]   We need to be hastening, speeding the coming of the Lord,
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:02.300]   sharing the gospel, serving those around us,
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.140]   loving the people around us,
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.060]   praying for his kingdom to come.
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:11.580]   We need to be trusting that God's word is true.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.660]   His promises are true.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.580]   We need to be on our guard.
[00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.140]   There are heresies out there.
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.540]   There are false prophets out there.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.340]   And we need to be growing in the knowledge of God.
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.900]   And so my question to you today is this.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.900]   Do you truly believe that God will come and judge the world?
[00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.660]   Do you truly believe?
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.260]   'Cause if you believe it,
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:46.140]   your belief will influence your actions, right?
[00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:49.860]   Your belief will influence your actions.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.900]   If you truly believe it,
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.620]   then you would change the way you are living
[00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.900]   as a Christian in the last days.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.660]   I remember when I was younger,
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.180]   as we see a picture of me in the younger self.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.820]   No, I'm joking.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:12.860]   (laughing)
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:14.260]   I remember when I was young.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.820]   I grew up in the church as a pastor's kid.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:23.860]   And I knew of all the stories,
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.940]   just like some of your kids,
[00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.940]   they grew up in the church,
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.980]   they knew of all the Bible stories,
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:29.540]   but I didn't believe it.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.780]   And so one day my mom came into my room and said,
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.980]   have you truly placed Jesus
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.220]   as the Lord and Savior of your life?
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:42.100]   And I didn't, as an eight or a nine-year-old, I didn't.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.780]   And so I prayed a prayer with my mom.
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:47.900]   And I asked Jesus into my life.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.700]   I believed that Jesus existed at that time.
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:58.300]   And that influenced my action to place my trust in Him.
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:03.420]   I placed my trust in Him.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.820]   And then when I was 14, there was a dedication night.
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.620]   And you know, we've had Explorer camps in the past,
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.620]   and we've had a dedication night.
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.580]   And the first dedication is dedicating yourself to God.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:17.900]   The second one is to live your life,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:21.220]   live a Christian life, live as a Christian.
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.340]   And the third is to serve the Lord full-time.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:27.460]   And on this summer camp,
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:30.820]   my dad is the pastor and he's talking.
[00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.660]   He's like, Jesus has given everything for you.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.580]   He's died on the cross for your sins.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.180]   What is your response?
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.100]   How are you gonna respond to the Lord?
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:49.860]   And when I was 14 at that time,
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.500]   remember back when you were 14,
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:56.780]   at that time, I felt the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:02.940]   The Holy Spirit was just touching my life.
[00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:08.020]   And there was just such deep conviction
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.380]   that I am a sinner, I need a Savior.
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.500]   And the Savior has given up everything for me.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.780]   And what is my response?
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.700]   My response was, it was natural.
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.860]   I'm just gonna give my life to God.
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.940]   And so that day, when I was 14, I walked up
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:30.500]   and I gave my life to serve Jesus full-time.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.900]   I believed God saved me.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:38.940]   I believed God gave his life for me.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.980]   And that influenced my action.
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.980]   My action was what?
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:47.340]   I'm willing to give up my life to serve you full-time.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.500]   When I was in university,
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.460]   I got involved with a Christian group.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.780]   And this Christian group went out
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:00.020]   and had spiritual conversations with students on campus.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.660]   They did surveys, like, oh, what do you think about Easter?
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.060]   It's coming up.
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.340]   Oh, do you think Easter,
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.780]   does it have any religious connotation for you?
[00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:12.340]   And some people said yes, some people said no.
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.900]   And I remember this one conversation
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:18.780]   with somebody who was an atheist.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.420]   He got so angry at the belief of God
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.380]   because there were so many evil things
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.580]   that are happening in this world.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.860]   How can this supposedly righteous God
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.900]   let all these bad things happen?
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.140]   And he got so angry and was like, okay, calm down.
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.180]   We're just trying to have a conversation,
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.380]   see what you think.
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.900]   No need to be so emotional about it.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.460]   But at that time, that was the first time I saw
[00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:52.780]   that there are other, really other beliefs in this world,
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.780]   strong, opinionated beliefs that were against God.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:03.580]   You know, I lived in that Christian bubble.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.780]   Everything was good.
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.660]   Everybody believed in the same thing.
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.740]   And when I stepped out in the university,
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.140]   I saw, I believed
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:18.540]   that this world had all these sorts of different beliefs.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:24.300]   And my belief that the world was different
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:30.220]   caused me to really have a desire to share the gospel.
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.140]   Before I thought, oh,
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:36.900]   everybody sort of believes the same thing.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.820]   We all live in the happy Christian bubble.
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.340]   Everybody sing kumbaya.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:46.980]   That when we had that conversation with that atheist
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:50.620]   and he got so emotional and he believed it so much,
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:56.580]   that's when my belief influenced my action.
[00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.140]   And that's when my passion
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.380]   to share the gospel really started.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.980]   On campus, we started sharing the gospel
[00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:09.500]   and I started learning more about Jesus
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:15.420]   and his ministry and his ministry of building up disciples.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.260]   And I saw, wow, he had a vision.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.020]   It wasn't just, he was just randomly walking around.
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.300]   Oh, this looks like a nice spot on Google Maps.
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.940]   Let's go here and see what happens.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.460]   No, he had a strategic plan,
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.860]   building up the disciples around him,
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.500]   training them, seeing them grow
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.060]   so that they could also multiply.
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:43.620]   My belief that Jesus had a strategic plan
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:48.900]   influenced me to now want to make disciples,
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:52.900]   build up the next generation of leaders.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:59.180]   And so that's become my mission statement of life.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:05.260]   Share the gospel, build up leaders for the next generation,
[00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:10.900]   for the gospel, Christ-centered believers.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:16.500]   And then I started to work in finance.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.860]   Who works in finance?
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.420]   It's a lovely place, isn't it?
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:26.140]   Full of love and care and not greed and giving, right?
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.620]   I worked in finance in Toronto.
[00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:35.500]   I was in some of the major banks for two years.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:39.540]   And I saw the greed of the people.
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:44.540]   They were consumed with money, money, sex, power.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:49.380]   Fake it till you make it.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:50.620]   That's what I was taught.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:56.060]   And then I came to Hong Kong
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:59.540]   and I see how much you guys work.
[00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.940]   You guys really like to work, you know?
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.900]   Nine to nine, sometimes, you know,
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.940]   these guys work at nine to two
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.980]   and then wake up and then work again.
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:13.740]   They're slaves.
[00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:17.300]   It's like becoming a slave to the greed,
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.740]   slave to the work, slave to the money.
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:26.980]   And my belief, my understanding of what was happening
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:30.900]   in the corporate world influenced my desire
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:37.020]   to share the gospel with the people, the working people.
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:41.660]   Why do I work with university students?
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.460]   So that one day when they come up into work,
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:47.140]   they'll live Christ-centered lives.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.860]   They'll do so well in their job
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.820]   and yet they'll do so well
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.340]   in glorifying God at the same time.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:55.980]   That'd be so cool.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:01.460]   A lineup of lawyers, professors,
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.020]   glorifying God in whatever they do.
[00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:10.540]   My belief influenced my actions.
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.660]   So my question to you today
[00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:20.580]   is what is your action telling you
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.300]   about what you truly believe?
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:27.220]   What is your action telling you
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.060]   about what you truly believe?
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:36.060]   Does that make sense?
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.340]   It does.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:46.340]   And my hope to you is that God
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.380]   is speaking into your heart today.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.980]   These are the last times.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.140]   There is a sense of urgency.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:59.180]   We need to see people come to know Jesus
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.460]   as we share his gospel.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.380]   We need to trust that God is using us
[00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.500]   as we share his word, as we step out in faith.
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:12.820]   I trust that God is speaking to you tonight
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.660]   and telling you that there is a sense of urgency.
[00:35:16.660 --> 00:35:18.500]   We need to change our action.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.420]   We need to change our character.
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.860]   We need to change what we trust.
[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.860]   We need to trust that Jesus is coming
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:33.820]   and he will judge the earth one day.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:37.700]   I'm gonna ask the worship team to come up
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.820]   as we take a time to pray.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.660]   Let's just bow down our heads
[00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:46.500]   and take a moment to reflect
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:50.860]   what is our belief?
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:57.260]   Do we truly believe that God is coming?
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:03.220]   That he will judge in the last days?
[00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:09.980]   Do we truly believe that God is asking us
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.740]   to make disciples of all nations,
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.580]   to go to the ends of the earth?
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.500]   Let's take a moment to respond.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:41.420]   (soft piano music)
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.180]   (soft piano music)
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:48.700]   (soft piano music)
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:37:10.620]   (soft piano music)
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.540]   (soft piano music)
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:21.460]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word in 2 Peter.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:25.860]   It's a reminder for us as Christians
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:30.900]   in the last days that we need to prepare for your coming.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.900]   There is work to be done.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.140]   You are patient with us.
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.660]   You're patient with our friends and those around us.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.140]   You're giving us an opportunity to repent
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.660]   and share the gospel with them.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:52.020]   Lord, give us this passion to live for you.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:56.420]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.260]   Let's stand.
