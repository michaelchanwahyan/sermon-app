1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,680
 Amen. Amen. Thank you. Pastor

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:39,680
 We have a vision to take the gospel to the whole world by 2033. One, a germ of an idea, an acorn planted here in this church. I want to show you a picture of a breakfast that was held in 2017.

3
00:00:39,680 --> 00:01:05,680
 at the Foreign Correspondents Club. This was the place that that acorn was birthed. And in Hong Kong now we have over 52,000 subscribers from 400 churches in the city. The Hong Kong version is in six different languages.

4
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 But today, over 20 countries, the one song that you heard last week, that we sang last week, is now available in over 20 languages. An estimated 300,000 participants with a film that will eventually be available in every language in the world.

5
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:48,680
 And the Bible in every language by 2033. My friends, our acorns have become big oak trees.

6
00:01:48,680 --> 00:02:03,680
 Now, you will remember a year ago, we started Matthew's gospel together as a church, as we declared Jesus is King.

7
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:21,680
 Here's a slide you may remember from 12 months ago. If we were looking for something similar today, a similar expression for Mark, I'd probably suggest Jesus is servant.

8
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:41,680
 But we could quite easily have chosen Jesus is Messiah. So what we've settled on is Mark my word. It's a play, of course, on Mark's name.

9
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:56,680
 And it's a famous expression. One that means that something you say will tell you, will tell someone about something you are certain that will happen in the future.

10
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:12,680
 Let me give you an example. Mark my words. If Johnny went out and got a haircut on Monday, there would be a stream of eligible young females queuing up to go out with him.

11
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,680
 Can you see what I mean?

12
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:31,680
 Mark's gospel was almost certainly written by John Mark, who we meet several times in the book of Acts.

13
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:45,680
 From the book of Acts, it may be gathered that John Mark's mother, Mary, had a large house in Jerusalem to which Peter fled after escaping prison.

14
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:55,680
 That John Mark assisted Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey to Cyprus, but then returned to Jerusalem.

15
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:05,680
 And then later, controversy over receiving John Mark back led to Paul and Barnabas parting ways.

16
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:15,680
 With Barnabas taking Mark back to Cyprus, and both of them disappearing from the narrative of the book of Acts.

17
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:38,680
 It was probably written in Rome in about 55 AD. And it seems that although John Mark was not one of Jesus' 12 disciples, it was likely that Simon Peter had dictated a whole chunk of this gospel.

18
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:47,680
 Now this might explain why there is no mention of Jesus' birth or his childhood.

19
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:56,680
 If you open up page one, it says, "When he or she had reached age 30."

20
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:05,680
 And then halfway through, you just get to things and they start talking about his death.

21
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,680
 Well, that's Mark's gospel, and that is Jesus.

22
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,680
 Let me put it into context.

23
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:28,680
 If you were writing a book about somebody, and on page one, it opened by saying, "When they had reached age 30."

24
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,680
 And then halfway through, started talking about the week of their death.

25
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
 You'd think it was strange.

26
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,680
 But as I said, that's Mark's gospel, and that's Jesus.

27
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:49,680
 Mark's gospel is also more about what Jesus did, rather than what he said.

28
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,680
 So there's nothing like the Sermon on the Mount.

29
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,680
 But there's almost 30 miracles.

30
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:04,680
 Amongst the four gospels, Mark's was the most neglected by the early church.

31
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,680
 Indeed, there was no commentary on Mark's gospel until the 6th century AD.

32
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,680
 Now, various factors account for this.

33
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,680
 It is by far the shortest of the gospels.

34
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,680
 90% of its stories are found in either Matthew or Luke.

35
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,680
 We call the three of them the synoptic gospels.

36
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:39,680
 The early church, Father Augustine, considered Mark to be a mere abbreviation of Matthew and Luke.

37
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:47,680
 Mark's gospel also has a somewhat rougher, less literary style than its peers.

38
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:56,680
 It is not nearly as elegant as Luke, for example, nor as thematically structured as Matthew.

39
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:08,680
 The Gospel of John, of course, has its own identity, directly connecting Jehovah I am from the Old Testament to Jesus I am in the New Testament.

40
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:24,680
 Mark also has, to be fair, a greater number of problem passages, difficult statements and actions by Jesus that it seems that Matthew and Luke had sort of smoothed out.

41
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:34,680
 But that historical neglect has, however, been reversed in recent years.

42
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,680
 And today, Mark's gospel is amongst the most intensely studied of the gospels.

43
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:55,680
 A significant amount of scholars consider it to have been the first gospel written and a primary source for both Matthew and Luke.

44
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:06,680
 Mark writes in a powerful and energetic literary style full of drama, mystery and color.

45
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:22,680
 Like the other gospels, he provides a unique portrait of Jesus with a special insight into who Jesus was and what he came to accomplish.

46
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:30,680
 The structure of Mark's gospel provides the key to the author's purpose.

47
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:39,680
 The first half of the gospel concerns the identity of Jesus as the mighty Messiah.

48
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,680
 And as the son of God, we might say the who.

49
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,680
 The second half concerns the mission of Jesus.

50
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,680
 We might say the why.

51
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:03,680
 So you can see the first half is about who Jesus was and secondly why Jesus did what he did.

52
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:21,680
 Now, shockingly, the Messiah is not here to conquer the Roman legions, as many people expected, but to suffer and to die as an atoning sacrifice for sins.

53
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:33,680
 Mark writes to show that Jesus' crucifixion does not negate his claim to be the Messiah, but rather affirms it.

54
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,680
 His faithfulness to this mission becomes the model for all discipleship.

55
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:50,680
 Following Jesus means denying yourself, taking up your cross and following him.

56
00:09:50,680 --> 00:10:10,680
 As we start this amazing seven week journey, we join hundreds of thousands of Christians around the world in 22 countries and multiple languages to listen and to watch Mark's gospel.

57
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:21,680
 We start with a very important subject, the identity of Jesus.

58
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:31,680
 Just as the Alpha calls, I've said it again, sorry, but just to reiterate what Johnny said, it is not too late to get your friends to come along this week.

59
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:47,680
 And just as it starts off with who is Jesus, we're going to take a look at this in Mark chapter one, and we're going to present some very important witnesses.

60
00:10:47,680 --> 00:11:03,680
 Now, in a trial, the decision whether to convict or to release, to find guilty or to find not guilty, often rests on the testimony of witnesses.

61
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,680
 Witnesses will either be for the prosecution or for the defense.

62
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,680
 And their statements are key to the eventual verdict.

63
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,680
 Mark chapter one has several key witnesses for Jesus.

64
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,680
 I want to look at each one of them.

65
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
 But firstly.

66
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
 I want to watch.

67
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,680
 I want to watch our reading tonight.

68
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
 Mark chapter one.

69
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:46,680
 Let's watch it.

70
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:55,680
 The beginning of the good news about Jesus, the Messiah, the son of God, as it is written in Isaiah, the prophet.

71
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,680
 I will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way.

72
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,680
 A voice of one calling in the wilderness, prepare the way for the Lord.

73
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,680
 Make straight paths for him.

74
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:21,680
 And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

75
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,680
 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him.

76
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,680
 Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.

77
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,680
 John wore clothing made of camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist.

78
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,680
 And he ate locusts and wild honey.

79
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
 And this was his message.

80
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,680
 After me comes the one more powerful than I.

81
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:53,680
 The straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.

82
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:12,680
 I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.

83
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:33,680
 At that time Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

84
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:43,680
 Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.

85
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,680
 And a voice came from heaven.

86
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:58,680
 You are my Son, my love. With you I am well pleased.

87
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:09,680
 At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness, and he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan.

88
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:25,680
 He was with the wild animals and angels attended him.

89
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:35,680
 I don't know about you, but that scene of Jesus being baptized always chokes me up.

90
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,680
 That was a little taster.

91
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,680
 The one actually has no reading to listen to tomorrow.

92
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,680
 It's a film. It's about 10 to 12 minutes film.

93
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:54,680
 And that's a little taster for you for what you expect when you wake up tomorrow morning.

94
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,680
 I want to get now to my first witness.

95
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,680
 And my first witness was John Mark himself.

96
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,680
 This is what John Mark wrote.

97
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,680
 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

98
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,680
 John Mark states boldly that Jesus Christ.

99
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,680
 Is the Son of God.

100
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,680
 It is likely the mark was an eyewitness to some of the events he wrote about.

101
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,680
 Acts 12, as I said earlier, says that he lived in Jerusalem with his mother, Mary.

102
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:41,680
 And their home was a meeting place for believers in the city.

103
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,680
 So that's my first witness.

104
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,680
 My second witness is Isaiah and the prophets.

105
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,680
 When I saw that, I thought that would be a good name for a pop group, a heavy metal group.

106
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,680
 So this is what Isaiah and the prophets might look like.

107
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,680
 But this is what it says.

108
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,680
 As it is written in Isaiah, the prophet.

109
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,680
 Behold, I send my messenger before your face.

110
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,680
 Who will prepare your way?

111
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,680
 The voice of one calling in the wilderness, the voice of one crying in the wilderness.

112
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,680
 Prepare the way for the Lord.

113
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,680
 Make straight paths for him.

114
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,680
 Mark actually cites two quotations from Old Testament prophets.

115
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,680
 Malachi 3, 1.

116
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,680
 And Isaiah 43.

117
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:53,680
 The words messenger and voice refer to John the Baptist, the prophet, the God sent to prepare the way for the sun.

118
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:04,680
 In ancient times, before a king visited any part of his kingdom, a messenger was sent before him to prepare the way.

119
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,680
 This included both repairing the roads and preparing the people.

120
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:19,680
 By calling the nation to repentance, John the Baptist prepared the way for the Lord Jesus Christ.

121
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
 And Isaiah.

122
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:30,680
 And Malachi joined forces in declaring that Jesus Christ is indeed.

123
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,680
 The Lord.

124
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,680
 My third witness is John the Baptist himself.

125
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,680
 Let's read this.

126
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:52,680
 John appeared baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.

127
00:17:52,680 --> 00:18:04,680
 And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the River Jordan.

128
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,680
 Confessing their sins.

129
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:14,680
 Now, John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist.

130
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
 And he had locusts and wild honey.

131
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:30,680
 And he preached, saying, after me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.

132
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,680
 I baptize you with water.

133
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:42,680
 But he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.

134
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,680
 Jesus.

135
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,680
 Called John the greatest of the prophets.

136
00:18:51,680 --> 00:19:04,680
 As we saw in the film, in his dress, in his manner of life, in his message of repentance, John identified with Elijah.

137
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:15,680
 The wilderness, which we pictured here, where John ministered, is the rugged wasteland along the western shore of the Dead Sea.

138
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:32,680
 John was telling the people symbolically that they were in a spiritual wilderness, far worse than the physical wilderness that their ancestors had endured for 40 years.

139
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:48,680
 John called the people to leave their spiritual wilderness, trust their Joshua, Jesus, and enter into their inheritance.

140
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:57,680
 Now, note, John was careful to magnify Jesus and not himself.

141
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:08,680
 John would baptize repentant sinners in water, but the coming one, Jesus, would baptize them with the Holy Spirit.

142
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,680
 Let's look at Acts chapter one.

143
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,680
 Before his ascension, Jesus said to the disciples.

144
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:29,680
 And while staying with them, he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which he said, you have heard from me.

145
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:41,680
 For John baptized with water, but in a few days, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.

146
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:48,680
 The word I got as I prayed about this verse was saturation.

147
00:20:48,680 --> 00:21:02,680
 John's message and baptism were preparation so that people would be ready to meet and trust the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

148
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,680
 In my personal prayer time, I sensed that God was saying this.

149
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
 I want to read it to you.

150
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:21,680
 I am about to pour out my Holy Spirit upon you in a measure and in ways that you have never seen before.

151
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,680
 Get your empty vessels.

152
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,680
 And I had pictures of buckets.

153
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
 We were holding buckets.

154
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,680
 Get your buckets ready to be filled.

155
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,680
 Saturation.

156
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
 Do not be frightened.

157
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,680
 Do not limit my spirit.

158
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,680
 Get ready.

159
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,680
 Which leads me to the last and most important witnesses.

160
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,680
 The Father and the Holy Spirit.

161
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,680
 Let's read on.

162
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,680
 In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.

163
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:13,680
 Just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven being torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove.

164
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,680
 And a voice came from heaven.

165
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,680
 You are my son, whom I love.

166
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,680
 With you, I am well pleased.

167
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:33,680
 When Jesus was baptized, the spirit came on him as a dove.

168
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,680
 And the Father spoke from heaven and identified his beloved son.

169
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:49,680
 The people who were there did not hear the voice or see the dove, but Jesus and John did.

170
00:22:49,680 --> 00:23:00,680
 The word "beloved" not only declares affection, but it also carries the meaning of "the only one."

171
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:07,680
 Mark did not write his book about just any Jewish servant.

172
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:17,680
 He wrote his book about the very Son of God who came from heaven to die for the sins of the world.

173
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:24,680
 Yes, Jesus is the servant.

174
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
 But he's a most unusual servant.

175
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:35,680
 After all, it is the servant who prepares the way for others and announces their arrival.

176
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:42,680
 But others prepared the way for Jesus and announced that he had come.

177
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,680
 Even heaven itself took notice of him.

178
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:56,680
 This servant is God the Son.

179
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:11,680
 But as I draw to a close, and I want to look for a practical application for us in Hong Kong.

180
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:22,680
 In 2021, we are a fatherless generation.

181
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:37,680
 Not only I'm talking about single parents now, but I'm talking about fathers who are absent, who work too hard, who even when they are home are not present.

182
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,680
 This generation are lacking fathers.

183
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:49,680
 I want to use the father's affirmation of Jesus in verse 11.

184
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,680
 "You are my beloved Son, whom I love. With you I am well pleased."

185
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,680
 To get down to some truths that affect every one of us.

186
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:12,680
 As I see it in the 21st century, especially in a place like Hong Kong, we have three major crises that are constantly attacking us.

187
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:19,680
 I'm not talking about the virus or the economy or the political situation here.

188
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:31,680
 What is in deep crisis, however, is firstly our identity.

189
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
 Who we are.

190
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:44,680
 So often our identity is found in our job, our education, our achievements.

191
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:50,680
 I say to people in Hong Kong, "How are you?" They say, "I'm busy."

192
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:59,680
 COVID and uncertainty about the future have attacked our identity.

193
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,680
 I can see it in your social media posts.

194
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:18,680
 Secondly, relationships. Talking about social media, we have hundreds of Facebook friends, acquaintances, at the expense of real relationships.

195
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:29,680
 We crave for real friends, real relationships, to be loved and accepted, especially by those who are closest to us.

196
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:35,680
 People say, "Pastor John, if only my father had done this."

197
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:43,680
 And thirdly, our purpose. We exist in a world today where so many people have no idea of their purpose.

198
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:49,680
 The events of the past two years have only heightened this.

199
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,680
 Hope seems to have disappeared from many of us.

200
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:13,680
 But during Jesus' baptism or graduation, his heavenly father identified three foundational truths that were essential to Jesus' public life and ministry.

201
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:21,680
 They appear to be the three primary foundation stones of Jesus' life and ministry.

202
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:38,680
 It might even explain, I said Mark started when Jesus was 30, why Jesus, 30-year-old Jesus, had spent 10 times more sharpening his axe than he did cutting trees.

203
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:44,680
 And all of these are in verse 11. I want to go through them one at a time.

204
00:27:44,680 --> 00:28:02,680
 Number one, you are my son. Jesus had come to learn who his father was and what his true identity and value was from his father's perspective.

205
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:09,680
 Number two, whom I love. Jesus had a tested and proven knowledge of his father's love.

206
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:17,680
 His relationship with his father was secure. It was not based on how many grade A's I got at school.

207
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:25,680
 It was not based on performance. And thirdly, with you, I am well pleased.

208
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:38,680
 Jesus had learned that his primary purpose for life and ministry was bringing joy and glory to his father above anything and everyone else.

209
00:28:38,680 --> 00:29:04,680
 My friends, this was Mark chapter 1. Before Jesus had done any ministry, God the Father was telling his son he was accepted, he was secure, and he was significant.

210
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:11,680
 His child, who he loves, in whom he is well pleased.

211
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:22,680
 I want to spend the next few minutes, the last few minutes we have together, being a witness myself.

212
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:38,680
 I'm called to the witness, Dan. I want to be a witness to somebody you may not even know.

213
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:46,680
 I want to introduce you to the real you.

214
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:55,680
 You might be asking yourself, who am I really? What is my true value? How attractive and desirable am I?

215
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:03,680
 Will I ever find the depth of intimate love that I long for? Where do I belong? Where is my future? Where is my hope?

216
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,680
 How am I going to cope after this COVID nonsense is over?

217
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:28,680
 And the truth is, we are often impacted by what others think about us, or more to the point, what we think others think about us, or what we think about ourselves.

218
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:34,680
 Or we can be impacted by what God knows about us.

219
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:43,680
 And the question is, which opinion dominates your thoughts?

220
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:52,680
 KFCI. The Father is the only one who knows us truly as we are.

221
00:30:52,680 --> 00:31:10,680
 Just as he said to Jesus, you are my son, I love you, I am pleased with you. His opinion of who we are is the only accurate and valid perspective of our identity and worth that exists.

222
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:21,680
 We can choose this evening to believe my value is determined by who I am, what I do.

223
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:28,680
 My achievements and the opinions of others.

224
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:45,680
 But my friends. God has empowered me tonight to give witness to exactly what he thinks about you.

225
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:52,680
 And these are not my words. These are from his word.

226
00:31:52,680 --> 00:32:07,680
 I want you to do something right now. I want you to close your eyes all over the zoom call. If you're on YouTube, I want to close your eyes. I want to speak to your, your very, very spirit. This is so, so important.

227
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,680
 Because I want to tell you some things.

228
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,680
 The first thing I want to tell you is that you are accepted.

229
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:23,680
 Maybe say in your heart or say out loud, I am accepted.

230
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:34,680
 You are God's child as a disciple, you're a friend of Jesus Christ. You have been justified. You have been united with the Lord and you are one with him in his spirit.

231
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,680
 You have been bought with a price and you belong to God.

232
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:48,680
 You are a member of Christ's body. You have been chosen by God and adopted as his child.

233
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,680
 You have been redeemed and forgiven all your sins.

234
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:02,680
 You are complete in Christ. You have direct access to the throne of grace through Jesus Christ.

235
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:09,680
 You are accepted. So just tell yourself, I'm accepted.

236
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:17,680
 Keep your eyes shut because I want to tell you that you're accepted. But also you are secure.

237
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:23,680
 Just tell yourself this or maybe call it out. I am secure.

238
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:30,680
 You are free from condemnation. You are assured that God works for your good in all circumstances.

239
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:37,680
 You are free from any condemnation brought against you and you cannot be separated from the love of God.

240
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:45,680
 You have been established, anointed and sealed by God. You are hidden with Christ in God.

241
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:51,680
 You are confident that God will complete the good work he started in you.

242
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
 You are a citizen of heaven.

243
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,680
 You have not been given a spirit of fear, but a power, love and a sound mind.

244
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:05,680
 You are born of God and the evil one cannot touch you.

245
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:13,680
 You are secure. Just say to yourself, I am secure.

246
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:17,680
 So you're accepted. You're secure.

247
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:23,680
 And lastly, you are significant.

248
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:31,680
 Just say that to yourself. I am significant. Maybe this is a little bit harder.

249
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:36,680
 You are a branch of Jesus Christ, the true vine and a channel of his life.

250
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,680
 You have been chosen and appointed to bear fruit.

251
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,680
 You are God's temple. You are a minister of reconciliation for God.

252
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,680
 You are seated with Jesus Christ in the heavenly realm.

253
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:54,680
 You are God's workmanship. You may approach God with freedom and confidence.

254
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,680
 You can do all things through Christ who strengthens you.

255
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,680
 You are significant.

256
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,680
 Now, open your eyes, please.

257
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,680
 My friend. Welcome.

258
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:22,680
 To our seven week journey through Mark's gospel.

259
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,680
 You are accepted. You are secure.

260
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:34,680
 You are significant. You are his beloved child.

261
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,680
 Whom he loves in you.

262
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,680
 He is well pleased.

263
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,680
 And our response tonight.

264
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,680
 Is to run to the father.

265
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,680
 I'm going to ask Paul and the band to sing this wonderful song.

266
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,680
 Run to the father. We're going to sing the words.

267
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,680
 I run to the father. I fall into grace.

268
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,680
 I'm done with the hiding. No reason to wait.

269
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,680
 My heart needs a surgeon. My soul needs a friend.

270
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:24,680
 So I run to the father again and again and again and again and again and again and again.

271
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
 and again.

272
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:35,680
