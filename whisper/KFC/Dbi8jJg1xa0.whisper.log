[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.240]   - Hello everybody, it's so awesome
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.680]   to be able to speak to you tonight about Samson.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.680]   And we are well underway in our theme of the book of Judges.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.860]   And we've gone through chapter one and two,
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.080]   we went through Ehud, Deborah, Gideon,
[00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.920]   and all these other amazing Judges.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.040]   And today we are talking about Samson,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.640]   the victory on Jawbone Hill.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.560]   Now to start off, it's gonna be a little bit interactive,
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.120]   get ready on the chat.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.920]   Who likes riddles?
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.000]   Anybody likes riddles here?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.720]   Okay, so what we're gonna do, this is the first riddle.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.920]   Okay, you can type the answer in the chat
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.840]   and maybe we'll have a prize for those who win, all right?
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.200]   I see Mark and Veronica getting ready.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.160]   What has a face and two hands, but no arms or legs?
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.840]   So what has a face, if we can go to that slide there.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.020]   Oh, very good, Mark, you're so good, you got it, very good.
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.080]   Okay, here's the second one.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.320]   What five letter word becomes shorter
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.120]   when you add two letters to it?
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.820]   What five letter word?
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.280]   Wow, Hanani, wow, you guys are so good, all of you.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.920]   You guys are our riddlers, all of you.
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.000]   And the reason why I wanted to start with a couple riddles,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.660]   hello gets shorter, I guess, maybe, helloer.
[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.640]   The reason why I wanted to start off with the riddle
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.960]   is because Samson was not only known for his strength,
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.440]   he was also known for his riddles.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.120]   And so we're gonna start off Judges chapter 13.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.080]   And how do you think Judges chapter 13 starts off?
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.740]   Actually, it starts off in exactly the same way
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.440]   as most of the chapters,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.440]   that Israel did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.880]   So the Lord delivered them into the hands
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.680]   of the Philistines for 40 years.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.920]   And so we see in the book of Judges,
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.800]   this continuous cycle, right?
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.640]   That there's peace and then Israel sins.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.640]   They get caught up in their neighbors.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.360]   Oh, I see my neighbor has a nice idol
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.920]   or my neighbor has this or that.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.760]   I wanna become my neighbor.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.640]   And they fall into sin and they start to worship other gods.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.900]   And what happens is God punishes them
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.140]   and sends people to oppress them.
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.360]   Just like this time,
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.480]   the Philistines were oppressing Israel.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.660]   And then usually what happens
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.940]   is there's a time of repentance, right?
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.340]   They say, "Sorry, God,
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.980]   we can't endure this suffering anymore.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.140]   Lord, please help us."
[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.820]   And then God sends them Judges, right?
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.540]   Like Ehud, like Deborah,
[00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.020]   like the people that we've been going through
[00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.420]   all these weeks.
[00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.860]   But however, this week is a little bit different.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.260]   Israel did not repent.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.820]   If you notice in chapter, in verse one there,
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.660]   Israel did not repent,
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.500]   but yet the Lord still delivered them,
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.080]   delivered them, sent them a deliver.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.480]   And that's because God wanted to deliver them
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.480]   out of the hands of the Philistines and their corruption.
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.580]   And slowly their gods would be influencing
[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.700]   the way they talk and their thinking and their beliefs.
[00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.620]   And God wanted to take them away from that.
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.720]   And so God sent a deliverer.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.700]   And we see in verse two, as we continue to read there,
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.820]   "A certain man of Zorah named Menorah
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.860]   from the clan of the Danites
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.380]   had a wife who was childless, unable to give birth.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.060]   The angel of the Lord appeared to her and said,
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.140]   "You are barren and childless,
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.300]   that you are going to become pregnant
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.200]   and give birth to a son.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.060]   Now see to it that you drink no wine
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.860]   or other fermented drink,
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.300]   and that you do not eat anything unclean.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.060]   You will become pregnant and have a son
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.580]   whose head is never touched by a razor
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.940]   because the boy is a Nazarite,
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.780]   dedicated to God from the womb.
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.260]   He will take the lead in delivering Israel
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.360]   from the hands of the Philistines."
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.740]   And so this angel of the Lord appeared
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.740]   to Samson's father, Zorah, and his wife.
[00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:56.480]   And chapter 13 continues with this amazing dialogue
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.200]   between the angel and Zorah and his wife.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.240]   And these are just amazing parents.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.380]   They were like, "Wow, we're gonna have a child.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.520]   How can we take care of this child?"
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.040]   And they were like, "God, can you send this angel,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.980]   this man of God back to us
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.480]   so that we can learn how to take care of this child?"
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.460]   And the angel of the Lord,
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.060]   they didn't know it was an angel at first,
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.080]   came back and he said to them, "You will become pregnant.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.160]   Your wife must do all that I have told her.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.960]   You must not eat anything
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.800]   that comes from the grape wine, nor drink any wine
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.460]   or fermented drink, nor eat anything unclean.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.740]   She must do everything I have commanded."
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.040]   The woman gave birth to a boy and named him Samson.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.520]   He grew and the Lord blessed him.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.920]   And the spirit of the Lord began to stir him
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.880]   while he was in Mahana, Dan,
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.160]   and between Zorah and Eshtetl.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.120]   All right, so we're gonna learn a couple things today
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.420]   about Samson the Nazarite.
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:10.200]   And we're gonna see five aspects of his story.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.900]   Firstly, we're gonna see Samson's vow and then vice.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.840]   He goes through some, everybody has their own vices.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.080]   He goes through a period of affliction
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.780]   and then he has revenge and retaliation.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.380]   Now, if you wanna remember these sort of points,
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.120]   you can remember VAR.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.480]   I know some people don't like VAR for certain reasons
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.580]   because some goals are prevented.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.860]   If you know what VAR is,
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.760]   you can have a Google of that if you don't know.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.460]   And so VAR, the first one is vow, Samson's vow.
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.440]   Samson was a Nazarite.
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.000]   And what does it mean to be a Nazarite?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.480]   Well, we see here that a Nazarite means to be separated
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.540]   or consecrated in special service for God.
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.980]   We see that in Numbers 6, verse 1 to 21.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:05.920]   And what does it involve?
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.960]   It involves three restrictions, three restrictions.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.520]   The first is you can't drink, okay?
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.360]   I know some people like their wine
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.460]   and this was one of the restrictions.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.640]   You could not drink.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.240]   Secondly, you could not cut your hair.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.700]   I know, I'm sorry, Kathy,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.840]   it wouldn't be good for your business, right?
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.940]   (laughs)
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.940]   If everybody was a Nazarite,
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.840]   it would not be good for the hairstylists.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.880]   The last thing is you could not touch a dead body,
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.720]   human or animal, human or animal.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.120]   And this is actually very similar
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.920]   to the vow of a high priest.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.920]   The high priest also had these restrictions
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.860]   that they could not drink and similarly cut their hair
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.500]   or touch the unclean.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.860]   And we see this in the book of Leviticus.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.500]   If you look through the book of Leviticus,
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.100]   the high priest also has these certain
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.680]   similar sort of restrictions.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.780]   And so we go to the story now.
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.220]   Let's look at the map of Israel.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.060]   So Samson is in Zorah, okay?
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.760]   So Zorah is in the middle here.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.560]   I don't know if you can see that.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.600]   That's where the red line starts.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.860]   Yeah, right there where the mouse is.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.240]   And Bonnie's doing an excellent job there.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.240]   So he is born in Zorah and he's gonna go to Timnah
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.940]   where he meets a certain woman.
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.940]   And later he will be going down to near the Mediterranean Sea
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.220]   and there's gonna be a battle there
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.260]   and we will continue and see the story.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.560]   So we went through Samson's vow
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.260]   and then now we're gonna go through Samson's vice.
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.160]   And so we will continue to read in Judges chapter 14.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:12.100]   "Samson went down to Timnah and at Timnah,
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.500]   "he saw one of the girls,
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.180]   "one of the daughters of the Philistines.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.740]   "Then he came up and told his father and mother,
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.720]   "I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.880]   "Now get her for me as my wife.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.280]   "But his father and mother said to him,
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.960]   "is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.160]   "or among all our people that you must go to take a wife
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.960]   "from the uncircumcised Philistines?
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.360]   "But Samson said to his father,
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.240]   "get her for me for she is right in my eyes."
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.500]   Now, if you see the highlighted text there,
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:53.220]   what Samson saw, he wanted.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.460]   He saw the daughters of the Philistines.
[00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.720]   He saw this woman and he said,
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.360]   "She is right for me in my eyes."
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.620]   And so he wanted to marry this woman.
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.800]   And so they arranged a marriage
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.280]   and the parents went down to Timnah.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.080]   And when they were on their way to Timnah,
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.560]   there was a lion.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.800]   A lion came and rushed after them.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.480]   I don't know if you've been hiking before,
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.800]   if you were hiking and then,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.220]   oh no, there's a snake or oh no, there's a wild dog
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.160]   and you're all of a sudden alarmed, right?
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.040]   And you wanna run away, but Samson does not run away.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.800]   And we see here in the next slide,
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.800]   then the spirit of the Lord rushed upon Samson
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.360]   and although he had nothing in his hand,
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.440]   he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.040]   You see in the picture here,
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.200]   Samson just tearing the lion, the jaws of the lion apart.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.560]   Now, this painting, lovely painting is by Giordano.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.640]   I don't think it's related to the Hong Kong fashion,
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.040]   but Giordano was a painter
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.920]   and he painted this picture of Samson and the lion.
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.340]   And so he went away, he killed the lion
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.700]   and then on his way back,
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.580]   somehow he was traveling back and forth.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:23.900]   He saw the lion again and within the lion,
[00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.420]   what did he see within this dead carcass?
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:30.980]   There was honey, there was bees flying around, right?
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.780]   And imagine there's honey in a dead carcass,
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.620]   who would eat it?
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.860]   Honey from a dead carcass, anybody raise their hand.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.040]   Mark, is that a hand up?
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.480]   No?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.600]   I don't think anybody would really wanna eat honey
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.200]   from a dead carcass, right?
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.440]   But what he saw, he wanted.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.640]   And yeah, exactly, Michelle, you don't wanna eat it, right?
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.700]   As much as you love honey in your tea.
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:59.640]   But he wanted what he saw
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.400]   and honey gave his mouth pleasure
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.240]   and he loved the sweet stuff and he ate it
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.640]   and he gave some to his parents without telling them
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.100]   that it was from a dead carcass.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.260]   And so because he ate from this dead carcass,
[00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.060]   the honey from this dead carcass,
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.780]   he violated one of the restrictions.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.680]   And what was that restriction?
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.540]   That you could not touch a dead body.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.500]   And so Samson violated that.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.060]   Next, he goes to his wedding banquet, right?
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.100]   And at a wedding banquet,
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.980]   you have feast and you have drinking
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.080]   and there the riddler within Samson comes out
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:44.400]   and he says to his guests
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.840]   and all his companions that were there,
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.700]   "If you can answer this riddle,
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.700]   "I will give you 30 garments and 30 clothes."
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.240]   Back then that was like amazing, right?
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.680]   It'd be like, oh, if you get this riddle,
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.420]   imagine if you were at Ben and Fanny's wedding, right?
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.620]   And you were just like,
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.920]   "Hey, I wanna give you guys a contest," right?
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.280]   Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.140]   It's a weird contest, but the groom says,
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:15.760]   "I wanna give you guys a contest.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.820]   "I will give you 30 LV and 30 Gucci, right?
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.240]   "If you can answer this riddle
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.460]   "and at the end of seven days, if you can't answer it,
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:33.460]   "then you have to give me 30 linen garments and 30 clothes."
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.840]   And so this was the riddle.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.200]   Out of the eater, something to eat.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.640]   Out of the strong, something sweet, right?
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.320]   And that was obviously the lion, right?
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:53.320]   And so we see in verse 18 what will happen next.
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.600]   And so the Philistines that were there
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.880]   and celebrating at the banquet,
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.000]   they were stumped, right?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.380]   I don't know.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.500]   I don't know exactly how to answer this.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.800]   I don't wanna lose 30 linen garments.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.360]   I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose face, right?
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.380]   I wanna win, right?
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.440]   And so they go to his wife,
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:19.240]   this woman who is gonna marry Samson.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.840]   And we're like, "How could you give us this shame?
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.280]   "We're gonna lose this contest, this riddle.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.200]   "We're gonna lose it."
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.640]   And so they keep nagging and threatening his wife.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.400]   And then his wife goes to Samson and like,
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.300]   "Oh no, Samson, you brought me such shame.
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.920]   "Like how could you do this, right?
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.980]   "In front of my own family and people and relatives,
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.980]   "how could you do this to me?"
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.980]   And he keeps nagging Samson day after day after day.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.800]   And Samson just finally gives in and was like,
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.060]   "Finally, okay, I'll tell you the answer.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.920]   "I haven't even told my parents
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.540]   "that I will tell you the answer."
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.860]   And so we see in verse 18 what happens.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.640]   Before sunset on the seventh day,
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.540]   the men of the town said to him,
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.560]   "What is sweeter than honey?
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.240]   "What is stronger than a lion?"
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.700]   Samson said to them,
[00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.120]   "If you had not plowed with my heifer,
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.360]   "you would have not solved my riddle."
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.160]   And so at that time,
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.580]   then the spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.400]   and he went down to Eshkodlin,
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.880]   struck down 30 of their men,
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.440]   stripped them of everything
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.600]   and gave their clothes to those
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.760]   who had explained the riddle.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.820]   Burning with anger,
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.600]   he returned home to his father's home.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.440]   And Samson's wife was given to one of his companions
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.780]   who attended the feast with him.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:56.600]   So we see Samson's vice.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.460]   His vice was he goes after what is in his eyes.
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.960]   What he sees,
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.420]   he sees that beautiful girl
[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.700]   and he wants that beautiful girl.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.000]   He sees the honey and is like,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   "Wow, it's so sweet.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.380]   "Wow, I want that."
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.260]   Right?
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.620]   And then he disobeys the Nazirite vow.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.280]   And what happens?
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.580]   He also responds in anger.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.260]   Right?
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.180]   He either wants with,
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.860]   he wants, he's a hedonist.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.260]   He wants what his eyes see.
[00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.180]   He wants that taste of honey.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.860]   And then he also has an anger issue.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.700]   Right?
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.240]   And so that was Samson's vice.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.100]   The next thing we see is Samson's affliction.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.300]   His wife betrays him.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.120]   Right?
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.480]   That wouldn't be very nice.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.620]   Would you like your wife to betray you
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.500]   on your wedding banquet?
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.140]   That wouldn't be very nice.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.940]   And then what happens afterwards?
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.940]   His father-in-law gives his wife over to his best man.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.780]   Talk about drama.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.420]   Days of our lives, right?
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.340]   This is crazy.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:12.100]   His wife is given to his best man.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.160]   His father-in-law betrays him.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.580]   And so we see next Samson's revenge.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.020]   He's angry and he goes down
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.820]   and causes,
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.060]   he kills all these people just to get the clothes
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.540]   for these Philistines.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.300]   And next, what does he do?
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.580]   He catches 30 foxes.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.420]   30 foxes.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.220]   Has anybody caught a fox before?
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.060]   Yeah?
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.420]   Is it popular in the UK?
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.680]   I don't, I know they do fox hunting,
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.620]   but it might not be that easy, right?
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.740]   To catch foxes.
[00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.900]   Well, maybe he was also a beast master or something.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.720]   I don't know.
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.940]   How do you catch 30 foxes?
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.220]   He must've been really fast
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.460]   or he must've had some bait or something, right?
[00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.780]   But he catches these foxes and ties them by the tail.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.100]   And then he puts a torch,
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.020]   lights a torch between their tails.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.740]   And he sends them off into the Philistines'
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.100]   grain and orchids.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.660]   And of course, all of their grain is just on fire, right?
[00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.980]   And all their food is on fire.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.900]   It's just, it's destruction everywhere, right?
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.900]   And the Philistines are like, how did this happen?
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.980]   Who is responsible for this?
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.340]   And the people were like, Samson is responsible.
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:38.560]   And so the Philistines go to the Israelite territory
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.500]   and attack the Israelites.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.260]   And the Israelites were like, why are you attacking us?
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:48.940]   Like, we are under your rule and we accept it, right?
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:52.140]   But then the Philistines said to them,
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.860]   we only want one person and that is Samson.
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.780]   We want revenge on what he has done to us.
[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.340]   And he's destroyed our crops and attacked our people.
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:08.340]   And so the Israelites went to Samson
[00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:12.740]   and was like, bro, what you doing?
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.460]   Bro, what you doing, man?
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.820]   You're causing all this conflict.
[00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:19.780]   And it's affecting us.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.860]   The Philistines are our rulers.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.980]   What are you doing?
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:29.620]   And so Samson was like, okay, I'll do as you guys say.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.820]   You guys can bind me and take me to the Philistines.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:39.820]   And so Samson was bound by straw and the hands
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.540]   and he was delivered to the Philistines.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.140]   And as soon as he saw the Philistines,
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.700]   what happened?
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.180]   We see in the next slide.
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.860]   Then the spirit of the Lord rushed upon him
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.820]   and the ropes that were in his arms
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.540]   became as flax that has caught fire.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.100]   And his bonds melted off his hand
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.940]   and the bonds melted off his hands.
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.340]   And he found a fresh jawbone from a donkey
[00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.580]   and put out his hand and took it.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.300]   And with it, he struck a thousand men.
[00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.940]   Once again, this is artwork from Giordano,
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.500]   sponsored by Giordano today.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.300]   And he took that jawbone
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.620]   and just totally destroyed a thousand Philistines.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.620]   What a crazy battle it must've been.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.540]   A thousand on one.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.540]   You would have thought the Philistines
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.500]   would have had a better strategy.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.740]   You know, a thousand to one,
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.420]   maybe have a better formation or I don't know,
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.340]   maybe track them somewhere.
[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:42.260]   Like a thousand to one and he has a jawbone?
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.340]   Come on, right?
[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:48.060]   But the spirit of the Lord was the one that empowered him.
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.060]   The spirit of the Lord,
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.500]   we see that empowering in his life several times.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.340]   And so what can we learn from the story of Samson today?
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.180]   What can we learn?
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:05.180]   The first thing is that just as God called Samson
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.940]   to be a Nazirite, the Nazirite vow,
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:13.180]   consecrated, separated for the service of the Lord.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:18.180]   God has also called us for those who are in Christ Jesus,
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.100]   who have confessed him to be Lord and Savior.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:27.020]   God has called us to be his holy people, right?
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:32.020]   God has also told us that we are to be his light
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.420]   and his salt, to be a city on a hill.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.620]   God has called us to be his people.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.700]   I believe that for all of us,
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.620]   God has a general calling
[00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.940]   and God also has a specific calling for you.
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.700]   It might be a specific calling to go and work
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.260]   in the financial field.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.700]   It could be a specific calling to work in high school
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.500]   or to reach a certain group of people.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:05.940]   I remember when I was 14 and at church,
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.740]   we have the summer camp and during summer camp,
[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:10.940]   we have a dedication night.
[00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:15.660]   The first dedication is dedicating ourselves to the Lord,
[00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.900]   to be our Lord and Savior.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.420]   The second is to live for Christ
[00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.260]   and the third one was to go into full-time ministry.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:26.860]   I wanna devote my life to become a pastor or a missionary
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:33.140]   and when I was 14, I felt the Spirit of the Lord
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.220]   come into my heart and I was so emotional.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.120]   I felt him calling me and saying,
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.260]   "Jesus has given up everything for me."
[00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.100]   What is my response?
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.140]   What is my response?
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.420]   And my response was like,
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.020]   if Jesus has given everything for me,
[00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:55.380]   I should give everything to the Lord as well
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.940]   and I stood up and said,
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.020]   "I am willing, Lord, to go wherever you call me
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.980]   "and if it's to be a pastor or to be a missionary,
[00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.340]   "I want to obey your calling."
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.460]   And I didn't know at that time what it would be like,
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.980]   what my journey would be,
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.140]   but I was willing to obey the Lord and his calling.
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:21.260]   And so what is God's calling for your life?
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.420]   God has a general calling for us
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.540]   to go and share the gospel, to be his light,
[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:28.620]   to be his holy people,
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:33.300]   but God may also have a specific calling for you
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.980]   to reach a certain people group,
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.200]   to work in a certain vocation,
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.580]   to go into full-time ministry.
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.280]   What is God's calling for you?
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.580]   The second thing we learn from the story of Samson
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.340]   is that we can choose.
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.900]   We have a choice.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.500]   Samson chose his vice,
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.900]   his vice of his eyes.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.660]   He sought after what he saw with his eyes.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:02.840]   He was a hedonist.
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.200]   That we can choose victory over sin.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.780]   We can choose victory instead of vice.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:16.720]   And there are so many temptations in our life today.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.920]   Satan tries to throw so many curve balls at us
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.560]   to steer us away from God, to following God.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.000]   Just like Israel, they were like,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.280]   "Oh, Philistines have this God.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.960]   "They have this ruler.
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.820]   "We want this, we want that."
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.140]   They were influenced by that.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.220]   And it's so easy to be influenced by our culture
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.120]   and the people around us.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.700]   But instead of choosing our vices,
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.060]   we all have weaknesses.
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.300]   We can choose victory over sin.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.700]   We can choose victory over sin.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.320]   And the third point is this,
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.020]   that the spirit of the Lord empowers us.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.460]   The spirit of the Lord was working when Samson was born.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.960]   The spirit of the Lord was working when the lion came.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.860]   The spirit of the Lord came upon him
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:18.280]   when he defeated the people, the Philistines with a jabba.
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.820]   The Holy Spirit empowers us.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:27.420]   We can't live the Christian life on our own strength.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.860]   We need the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.960]   And that's the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:34.240]   If you have confessed Jesus to be your Lord and Savior,
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.300]   you have the Holy Spirit inside of you.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.080]   You have God inside of you.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.680]   That's so amazing.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.380]   And this Holy Spirit convicts us of our sin.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.280]   It guides us in the way we should go.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.500]   It empowers us to do things
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:55.120]   immediately more than we can ask or imagine.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.600]   God has commissioned us to go to the ends of the earth,
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:05.060]   to share the gospel, to make disciples of all nations.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.720]   Are you willing to be empowered by the Holy Spirit?
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.020]   Surrender to him.
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.320]   So the third point was commission.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.340]   And the last thing is this,
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.620]   that God can make good out of evil.
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.120]   God can make good out of evil.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.640]   Samson wasn't really a good judge, right?
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   Like he just went after his temptations.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:33.640]   He responded in anger.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.060]   These things are not what the Lord wants us to do, right?
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:42.880]   But God made good out of evil.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.760]   God made good out of evil.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:51.760]   He used Samson as a way to have deliverance
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.240]   against the Philistines.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.320]   And we see this throughout history,
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.460]   that God uses the weak things of this world
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.660]   to shame the wise, to shame the strong.
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.480]   You know, Apostle Paul had conflict
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:13.160]   with the other disciples, other apostles, right?
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.160]   It was Silas, right?
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.560]   Or Barnabas, he had conflict with them.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:20.240]   You know, Silas wanted to take Mark,
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.600]   but Paul was like, "Mark, you know,
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.380]   he deserted me on my last missionary trip.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.120]   I don't wanna take Mark."
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.000]   And so they had conflict with each other and they split off.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.120]   But God still used their conflict for good
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.120]   to share the gospel in different places in minor Asia.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:43.760]   God can make good out of evil.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.960]   And even if we fall, and we will fall sometimes,
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.160]   God is like a GPS, right?
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.400]   Who's used the GPS before?
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.700]   Sometimes it can be quite annoying, right?
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.760]   Please make a U-turn,
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.720]   or it's usually in a British accent, right?
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.040]   Please make a U-turn.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.200]   Turn left here.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.040]   No?
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:09.680]   Okay, you can switch languages, I think, or accents.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.680]   But the GPS always tells you where you've gone wrong.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:17.500]   It says, "Take a U-turn here.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.280]   You've gone the wrong direction."
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.880]   It sends you another route.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.080]   Terrible English accent.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.340]   Yes, James, your accent is much better.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.920]   (laughs)
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.320]   And God is like that.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.480]   He's always pursuing us.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.080]   Just like the song we sang,
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.840]   God is rushing after us.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.960]   He's pursuing us.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.080]   And God is like a GPS.
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.240]   And this is from Francis Chan,
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.920]   that God is like a GPS.
[00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.660]   And the next thing is,
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.980]   not only does God make good out of evil,
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.020]   he is working even when we don't see it.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:59.700]   God is working in miraculous ways.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.160]   For our good, he works for the good of those who love him.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:09.040]   And he wants you to fulfill your calling, glorify him,
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:16.300]   to choose victory over vice.
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.260]   He wants you to go out to be commissioned
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.860]   with his power and authority
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.180]   and the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:25.140]   to make disciples of all nations,
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.540]   go to the ends of the earth.
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:31.440]   And he wants you to know that he is in control.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.440]   Even in 2020, when everything seems like it's a mess,
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:41.060]   or even right now, maybe you feel isolated.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.140]   Maybe you feel like things aren't going the way
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.900]   that you want it to.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.300]   God is still working.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.660]   He loves you.
[00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.180]   He cared for the Israelites.
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.260]   He cares for you.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.880]   And he wants you to pursue him.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.180]   Let's pray together.
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:04.740]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the story of Samson.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.900]   And even though he did not do a lot of good things,
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:13.300]   you still used him to make good out of evil.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.300]   I pray, Lord, that we can learn from his mistakes.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:22.660]   And instead of choosing our vices, we would choose victory.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:25.740]   That we would choose to be empowered by the Holy Spirit,
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.380]   to surrender to the Holy Spirit,
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.320]   and to know that you are in control.
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.140]   Even in the midst of this virus,
[00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:38.020]   even in the midst of social distancing, you are in control,
[00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.500]   and you have what is best for us.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.820]   Bless us, Lord, as we respond in song.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.540]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
