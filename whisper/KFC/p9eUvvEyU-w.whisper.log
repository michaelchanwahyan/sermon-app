[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   Good, good.
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.480]   So good to be able to preach to you all, not via a camera.
[00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.880]   You've all got your masks on, so I can't see you.
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.880]   Really good to see you all.
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.880]   Hope you're all doing well.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.880]   Hope you're all going to be staying safe in these next couple of weeks or months.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.720]   We actually had to finish the last series on Ephesians online.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.760]   It was about identity, about who do we think we are.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.160]   We finished it talking about putting on the whole armour of God.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.800]   And then Pastor John last week started us off on a new series leading up to Easter called
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.120]   Jesus is King.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.520]   Nothing to do, no connection with Kanye West's latest album.
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.840]   But this idea of heading up to Easter and really digging into who Jesus is and what
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.460]   the gospels say about him.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.080]   And he went through, and John went through the genealogy of Jesus.
[00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.120]   He went from the 14 generations from Abraham to David, and then from the 14 generations
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.520]   from David to the deportation to Babylon, and then another 14 generations from Babylon
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.360]   to Jesus' birth.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.840]   And that was Matthew chapter 1.
[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.940]   And today, and that was the King's record.
[00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.920]   And today I want to be talking about the King's rise.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.440]   The genealogy really showed us that mankind, the history of mankind was all pointing to
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.120]   one point.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.240]   The arrival of the King, the Kingdom of Heaven arriving on earth.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   Matthew chapters 3 and 4 talks to us about Jesus announcing his ministry to the world.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.600]   This is Jesus beginning his story, the King's rise.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.000]   And John last week gave us four different points about the genealogy.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.400]   And today I'm going to give you the four A's about the King's rise.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.760]   Of course, these two chapters are huge, and there's so much in there, there could be at
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.280]   least a whole series in these two chapters.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.440]   But I'm going to split this into four very simple parts, the four A's.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.920]   The first about the King's rise is there is an announcement, and then there is an approval
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.920]   process.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.160]   He's announced, and then he's approved, and then he is assessed, and finally he assembles.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.920]   And as we look at this, as we look at how Jesus rises, I hope that it's of an encouragement
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.760]   to you that Jesus is King, even though outside it's very uncertain, that Jesus remains sovereign
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.560]   and is ruling and is King.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.320]   So the first one is this.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.920]   Jesus is announced.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.720]   Matthew chapter 3, verse 2 says this.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.800]   There's a guy who's in the wilderness, and he shouts this phrase, verse 2, "Repent, for
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.160]   the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.160]   Who is this guy?
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.280]   John the Baptist.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.480]   Matthew is writing about John the Baptist.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.480]   He's saying, "Repent, and the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.560]   That kingdom of heaven word is basically the same as kingdom of God.
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.160]   But it's interesting here because Matthew was writing to the Jewish people, and he knew
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.880]   that the Jewish people really are uncomfortable with the word God.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.960]   So instead of saying the kingdom of God, he would say the kingdom of heaven.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.420]   They're really the same things.
[00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.200]   And you know Matthew is talking to the Jewish people because then he writes the next verse,
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.400]   he quotes the prophet Isaiah.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.420]   Isaiah 40, verse 3 says this, and Matthew writes this in the next verse, "The voice
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.920]   of one crying in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.680]   Make his path straight.'"
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.960]   What he's telling the Jews here is that that guy that you've been waiting for, that guy
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.040]   that you have been expecting to come and rescue you, he is here.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.560]   The time is now, Jewish people.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   Do you get it?
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.740]   Do you know that it is him?
[00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.580]   He's confirming to them this is the guy now.
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.680]   And who's announcing this?
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.080]   John the Baptist.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.200]   Incredibly counter-cultural model of sacrificial obedience.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.960]   A crazy man is what we would say about him if we saw him in the streets.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.720]   He wore camel's hair.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.280]   He lived in the wilderness and he ate locust and honey for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.520]   An incredibly strange man.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.720]   But he is the one that was chosen to announce the arrival of the king.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.440]   And I want to talk a little bit about John the Baptist because he's a very interesting
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.440]   man.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.520]   He gave up his life to announce, to make the path straight.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.080]   And he was ferocious.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.880]   And you could see him talking to the Israelites.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.200]   And this passage carries on.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.900]   He's telling them to repent.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.480]   You guys, you think that you're going to be saved because Abraham is your granddaddy,
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.960]   granddaddy, granddaddy.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.960]   But you're not.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.520]   And he's telling them, "Bear fruits in keeping with repentance."
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.040]   He's saying, "If you really are genuinely saved, I need to see some fruits.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.200]   There has to be some difference in your life."
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   And at the moment, there isn't.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.320]   And if there isn't, one day, someone is going to come and they're going to throw you in
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.640]   the fire.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.280]   So he's got this boldness and courage about him.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.280]   He's fierce.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.440]   And yet, there's another side.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.780]   Whilst he's declaring all this, and this is where I really want you to imagine listening
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.780]   to this guy in the wilderness.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.420]   And he's getting quite a crowd.
[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.060]   Quite a lot of people are coming to hear this message and repenting and getting baptized
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.060]   by him.
[00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.980]   But whilst he has that strength and that popularity and he's drawing people in, there's another
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.980]   side to that.
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.900]   Whilst there is ferocity, there's also this sense of humility.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.620]   Because he says this, "I baptize you with water for repentance."
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.780]   But there's going to be coming someone who's going to baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.020]   And this guy, this guy, I can't even fill his shoes.
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.020]   Forget it.
[00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.100]   I'm not even allowed to carry his shoes.
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.300]   I'm unworthy to carry his sandals.
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.780]   This guy is Jesus.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.380]   And you better be ready because he is coming and he is here.
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.380]   Be ready.
[00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.340]   Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.640]   And so imagine this scene.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.320]   He's by the water in the wilderness.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   He's giving this message, a powerful message.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.360]   People are repenting.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.120]   And then lo and behold, Jesus himself comes and joins the gathering.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.980]   He comes and joins the gathering and then he walks through the crowds.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.280]   He walks to the water.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.440]   He goes up to John and asks John to baptize him.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.720]   Can you imagine just a moment what John would be doing in his camel's hair with locusts
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   still on his mouth?
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.600]   "What do you mean, me baptize you?
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.160]   You should be baptizing me.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.160]   You're Jesus.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.160]   You're our Messiah.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160]   You're the Savior."
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.720]   And then Jesus says this.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.360]   He says, "Let it be so.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.480]   Baptize me because it is time now to fulfill all righteousness."
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.320]   Have you ever wondered why Jesus needed to be baptized?
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.080]   The whole point of baptism is to declare that your old ways are gone and that your new life
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.920]   is beginning.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.080]   But Jesus didn't need to repent from his old ways.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.320]   Jesus was God.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.320]   He was flawless.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.840]   He was sinless.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.680]   So why did he have to be baptized?
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.480]   Why did he come at this moment as a 30-year-old man to come into the wilderness to be baptized
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.640]   by this crazy man?
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640]   What was Jesus actually doing?
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.480]   And I think the hint is in the Scriptures.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.800]   Three verse 11 says this.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.200]   When John was saying, "I baptize you with water for," what?
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.200]   "Repentance."
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   So I think there's two points here.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.340]   This word repentance isn't regret.
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.480]   When you do something wrong, you're like, "Oh my goodness.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.840]   I really shouldn't have done that.
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.280]   I should have known better.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.920]   I just feel so bad and guilty about this.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.920]   You apologize to whoever you wronged."
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.280]   That's not really repentance.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.320]   That's just regret.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:12.000]   Repentance is saying, "I was going this way and I now recognize that it's completely wrong
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.040]   and now I'm going to go this way."
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.640]   It's turning from your old ways and obeying God.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.880]   And what Jesus is doing here in this act of baptism when he didn't really need to, he
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.960]   was modeling to us true obedience.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.920]   He was modeling to us true obedience.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.920]   Why?
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.200]   And the second word is this.
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.720]   And it says here, Jesus says, "To fulfill all righteousness."
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.520]   Righteousness.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.760]   Jesus knows that one day all of us and all of those around the sea at that time, one
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:50.400]   day will be face to face with our Creator and righteousness will be demanded of us.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.880]   But he knows that we all fall short of the glory of God.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:01.920]   In this moment of being baptized, what he's doing is he's identifying with mankind, identifying
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:10.520]   with flawed humanity, identifying with Israel and saying, "I am here to fulfill all righteousness.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.080]   My righteousness I give to you."
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.160]   That song that Florence sang at the end, "Dressed in righteousness alone."
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.120]   That is what we're going to be when we meet our Creator, dressed in his righteousness.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.880]   2 Corinthians says this, "He made him who knew no sin to be sin."
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.880]   Why?
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   So that we could be the righteousness of God.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.800]   So what Jesus is doing as he gets baptized, he's showing us what total obedience looks
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:41.240]   like and he's also identifying with us, thereby qualifying as our Messiah.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.000]   That he was coming to save us.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.600]   And once we are baptized in him with the Holy Spirit, his righteousness now becomes ours.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   So there we have it.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.080]   Jesus is announced by John the Baptist.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.240]   The second point is this, is approved.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.480]   From the moment he gets baptized and then he gets lifted out of the water, an incredible
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.720]   scene happens.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.600]   Probably the defining moment of humanity.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.760]   What happens?
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:13.880]   The verse goes, "The heavens open and then the Spirit of God descends upon him like a
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:21.240]   dove and a voice comes from heaven and says, 'Behold, this is my beloved Son with whom
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.240]   I am well pleased.'"
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.080]   Pause.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.160]   The heavens opened.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.520]   I've seen clouds open and a bit of sun come.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.480]   The heavens opened.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.560]   Can you imagine being there?
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:41.280]   The heavens opened up and then the Spirit of God comes down on Jesus like a dove.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.000]   If you're a Jewish person, what does a dove mean to you?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.680]   A dove means peace.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.240]   A dove means Genesis chapter 8.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.400]   It means Noah and the flood.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.120]   It means the dove that symbolizes the new era.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:02.520]   You can see this dove descending on this man and you can see a new era being ushered in.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:08.360]   And then you hear a voice, maybe even Morgan Freeman style voice.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.760]   "Behold, this is my Son."
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.440]   I do not have such a low voice to do Morgan Freeman.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.600]   It's more like David Beckham for me and the accent is wrong.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:26.800]   "Behold, this is my Son, my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased."
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.880]   Have you watched those movies where at the beginning of the movie is a narrator and it's
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.000]   kind of like this.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.840]   Once there lived a boy named Charlie and he loved chocolate.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.400]   And a lot of films start like this.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.280]   And you have a narrator, again, just a very husky voice that starts this whole story off.
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.920]   And then once the narrating finishes, the story begins and then you follow the main
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.400]   character Charlie and then he goes through ups and downs in life.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.040]   But then you know that the narrator at the beginning that set the scene, you know that
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.880]   Charlie is going to be fine because the narrator is telling the story and the narrator lived
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.960]   to tell the story.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.920]   So you know at some point, even with all these ups and downs, Charlie is going to be fine.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.800]   And I think this is a little bit similar because I'm trying to imagine if I was there and I
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.880]   heard this voice come from heaven and this voice was saying, "Behold, this is my beloved
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.960]   Son with whom I am well pleased."
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.280]   For me, this is the beginning of Jesus' story.
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.000]   But I think the beginning points to the end.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.840]   It foretells the end because what I'm seeing, if I see the heavens open and this dove land
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.560]   on this man over there and a voice coming out to shout something, I'm thinking, "Whoever
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.040]   that guy is, he's got heaven on his side.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:44.360]   So whatever he is here to do, whatever mission he's on, he's going to succeed."
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.400]   Can you see that?
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:50.600]   God revealed himself through his voice, through the heavens opening already.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.400]   He already proclaimed his victory.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.920]   He was already very well pleased with his Son who was obedient, who had followed him.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.240]   That statement in itself is packed.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:03.920]   This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.920]   Again, the Jews, if they knew their scripture, they would go straight back to Isaiah chapter
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:08.920]   42.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   I think we have this.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.680]   Isaiah 42, "Behold my servant whom I behold."
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.400]   They would see the parallels.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.880]   "Behold, this is my beloved Son."
[00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.160]   This is talking about the chosen servant of Israel.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:28.240]   They would go to Psalm 2 and see, "Today," the next slide, "you are my Son.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.680]   Today I have begotten you."
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.120]   They will see the parallels.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.320]   This man is loved by God.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.480]   And you go even further back.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.160]   For me, this is probably the main one.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.360]   You go to Genesis chapter 22.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   I don't know if you heard this story before.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.720]   There was a guy called Abraham who couldn't have a baby for a very long time until one
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.000]   day God gifted him and his wife Sarah a baby, Isaac.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.320]   And the boy grew up.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:57.960]   And then one day, Abraham is asked by God, "Abraham, take your son Isaac whom you love."
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.160]   "And go up to the mountain to worship me."
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.160]   How?
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   To sacrifice Isaac.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.040]   "Sacrifice your only son whom you love."
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.320]   And Abraham obeys, takes Isaac up this mountain, puts him on the table, is just about ready
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.000]   to sacrifice him, and God stops him.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.680]   He says, "Stop.
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.520]   Now I know what is in your heart.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.800]   Now I know that you love me.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.080]   And actually, you don't need to sacrifice the son whom you love.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.960]   There's a lamb that's trapped in the bush over there.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.000]   Take that as a substitute."
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.880]   Fast forward all these thousands of years now, God is saying, "Behold, this is my son
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.080]   whom I love.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.080]   And I'm well pleased with him.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.800]   And I'm going to sacrifice him for mankind."
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   What God is saying here is three things.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.120]   He's confirming Jesus' identity, his relationship, and his purpose.
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.080]   Identity, why?
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.960]   God's confirming this man is divine.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.960]   This man is divine.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.240]   Last time I checked, no human being had heaven open for them and have their voice come down.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.040]   This man is divine.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.720]   What kind of divinity?
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.280]   His son, his relationship is that he is God's own son.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.360]   "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son."
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.880]   And finally, his mission.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.040]   He was here.
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.280]   He came from heaven to earth.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.840]   The kingdom of heaven is at hand because it has arrived now for a mission, and that pleased
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.840]   God.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.920]   Identity, relationship, purpose.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.840]   Jesus is first announced, and then he is approved.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.440]   And as if the heaven's opening wasn't quite strange enough for you, the next stage is
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.240]   even more interesting, I find.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.760]   Chapter four begins like this.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.960]   The moment that is finished, "With whom I am well pleased," we jump into chapter four.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:48.520]   And it says this, "Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:53.080]   From there he fasts for 40 days and 40 nights."
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:58.800]   And then the most biggest understatement of the year, "And he was hungry."
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.960]   He's not eating for 40 days and 40 nights, and he was hungry, I bet.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:08.480]   And what I said earlier about Jesus kind of identifying with mankind being baptized, he's
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   doing the same here.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.080]   Where the Israelites were trapped in the wilderness for 40 years but failed, Jesus was now going
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.460]   to be in the wilderness for 40 days, but he was going to pass.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.480]   And that model of sacrificial obedience that crazy man John the Baptist had, living in
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.200]   the wilderness eating locusts and honey, Jesus now looks at that and goes, "I'm going to
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.680]   go into the wilderness and I'm going to eat nothing but the Word of God."
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:37.320]   This is an even more intense version of obedience that Jesus is displaying here.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.940]   And there, Jesus is assessed.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.520]   We call this passage the temptation of Jesus.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.640]   This is Jesus coming face to face with the tempter, the enemy, the devil, and he's being
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:50.640]   tested.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.640]   And that's the verb there, really.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.700]   It's tempted, but it's really tested here.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:16:00.520]   And what this really tells me is when there is a mission, there is also, when there is
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.660]   a calling, there is also going to be a testing.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:11.060]   Jesus is called to come and save mankind, but before he does that, he, even Jesus, has
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.380]   to be assessed.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.380]   Why?
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:19.020]   Because true obedience can only exist when there is opportunity.
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:24.740]   If Jesus didn't get assessed, then he couldn't really prove that he was actually capable
[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.940]   and qualified to redeem mankind.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.580]   So he had to go through this process.
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:30.860]   He had to be tested.
[00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.380]   And this makes me think, actually, for us, if we are called, we must also be prepared
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.220]   to be tested.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.460]   That there is testing in our lives.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.460]   Of course, it's been pretty obvious this year, there is quite a lot of testing that's been
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:48.340]   going on, but we have to be prepared for that because it is good and it is right.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:52.020]   Going back to the wilderness, if you go to Deuteronomy 8, I think I put this on the slide
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.020]   up there.
[00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.020]   I didn't have this on there.
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.780]   8, chapter 2, there it is.
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.940]   God is talking to the Israelites and they're in the wilderness.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:03.240]   And the reason why is, verse 2, "And you shall remember the whole way that the Lord your
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:08.660]   God has led you these 40 years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know
[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:14.900]   what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not."
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:25.100]   God allows us to have tests, to humble us, to test us, to see what is in our hearts.
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:32.020]   Have you been going through a test these last few months, or this last year, or these last
[00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.420]   two years?
[00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:34.820]   What has it revealed in your heart?
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:40.900]   I often say this last year has caused a lot of problems to surface in Hong Kong, right?
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.660]   But my actual thought is these problems were always there, right?
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.740]   And these incidents, these events have merely just brought them up to the surface.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.780]   God allows for testing to happen.
[00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:57.900]   God allows for trials to happen, sometimes to humble us and test us, to reveal to us
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.860]   what is in our hearts.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.460]   And then we can then cry to him in Psalm 139, "Search me, O God.
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.980]   Test my thoughts, know my heart.
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:10.340]   See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me on the path everlasting."
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.620]   The apostle James in James chapter 1 says this, "Count it all joy when you face trials."
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.140]   Because what do trials bring?
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.020]   It brings a level of steadfastness.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.660]   And when steadfastness comes to its full effect, you will be perfect and lacking in nothing.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:25.660]   Perfect and lacking in nothing.
[00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:31.020]   Brother, sister, if you are going through a test right now in your life, emotionally,
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:37.140]   professionally, what is it revealing in your heart?
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:41.020]   What is God trying to speak to you about?
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.140]   Count it all joy that this is happening.
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.340]   Even Jesus had to be assessed.
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.340]   And how did he fight this?
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.860]   Actually, what was the battleground that he was being tested on?
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.820]   This is even more interesting.
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.580]   End of chapter 3 is this, "Behold, this is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.580]   Interestingly, the battleground is this.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:07.020]   When the enemy comes to Jesus, the first question is, "If you are the Son of God."
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:12.220]   Wait a minute, we just had heaven opened, a voice come down and declare that he is the
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.220]   Son of God.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.860]   So you see, the enemy is very interesting here.
[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:21.420]   Even in the face of truth, what he's trying to do is sow seeds of doubt in our minds.
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:28.380]   If you are really the Son of God, if you are really Daddy's boy, and you're hungry, you
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:35.380]   could satisfy this fleshly desire, you could turn these stones into tassel vows.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.740]   Like seriously, right now, you could do that.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.980]   Because you have that power, because you're Daddy's boy, right?
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.700]   And you see, this is where it's interesting.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:52.300]   It is about physical desires and needs, hunger, all these things, but it's really about identity.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:57.420]   And it's saying, "If you are the Son of God, I know you just had heaven opened up and Morgan
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:03.460]   Freeman tell you that you are, but do you really believe that?"
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.820]   And this takes me back to the last sermon in Ephesians, the whole armour of God.
[00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.820]   What was it?
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:15.340]   The helmet of salvation, reminding ourselves, our minds, our brains, that we are saved,
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.620]   that we are children of God.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:21.340]   And so Jesus then responds to him and says, "No, man shall not live by bread alone."
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.780]   And we're not going to go through each of those.
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.940]   And then he goes again, "If you are the Son of God, you could jump from this cliff."
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.060]   And what does the devil do?
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.860]   He quotes Psalm 91, which is what John just read to us.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:40.420]   He says, "Hey, in the scriptures it says that you can command angels to come and catch you
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.060]   if you fall.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.340]   Show me if you really are the Son of God."
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.380]   And then finally, he takes him up to the right to the top of the mountain and shows him the
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.620]   kingdoms of the world in all their glory.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:57.140]   And he says, "Hey, I know you came down here with a mission, but you don't need to do all
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.580]   this stuff for the next few years and then have the cross.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.980]   I can just give it you now.
[00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.420]   That's a lot of trouble, what you're going to be going through.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.420]   I could just give it you now.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:10.140]   All you have to do is bow before me, and then you don't need to do that.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:15.420]   You can have this kingdom, and you won't even need the cross."
[00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.420]   Isn't that the temptation that we have?
[00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:23.900]   You know, popular culture turns something that maybe young people will be more aware
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:29.260]   of, this idea of friends with benefits, this non-committal life that we want to live for
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.420]   our own satisfaction and pleasure.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.740]   Are we Christians with benefits?
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.740]   We want the kingdom of God.
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:39.300]   We want all the blessings to come our way, but we don't want to die to ourselves and
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.620]   to carry our own crosses.
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.060]   And that's the temptation that Jesus was faced with.
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.380]   And that's why the Bible tells us that Jesus is our high priest, that he sympathizes with
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:54.620]   our weaknesses because he was tested in every way that we are, for our physical desires,
[00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.700]   for power, for pride, for possessions.
[00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.460]   He was tested in every single way.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.060]   And how did he respond?
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.900]   Going back to the Ephesians, the whole armor of God, we talked about the final piece of
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.980]   armor was the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God.
[00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:13.660]   And I asked the question, "When we're faced in battles, do we use our own weapons, our
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.260]   own experiences, and our own wisdom, or do we use God's weapons, the Word of God?"
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:30.540]   And we see Jesus here every single time using the Word of God, declaring truth against deceit.
[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.420]   And he passes the test.
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.900]   He passes the test, the enemy leaves him, the angels come and minister to him, he's
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:40.860]   been announced, he's been approved, he's been assessed, he is nearly ready to take
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.460]   over the world.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:47.060]   The final stage is then he assembles.
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:56.260]   Jesus' strategy to redeem the world was to pick a crew of fishermen and tax collectors.
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.060]   That's what he did.
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:04.260]   And we carry on and see this in chapter 4, verse 18.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.660]   While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he sees two brothers, Andrew and Simon Peter.
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:09.980]   They're fishing, they're working hard.
[00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:13.580]   I've talked before how the Jewish culture is quite similar to the Chinese culture, working
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.580]   hard, staying in your family.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.820]   And these guys weren't really poor, they weren't the poorest of the poor, they weren't the
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:22.820]   richest of the rich, but they were good people, hard-working people, working with their families.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:28.020]   And Jesus walks up to them, and then as he's walking up to them, to the Sea of Galilee,
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:34.660]   he says these words that announce his invasion on enemy territory.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:42.660]   He talks to individuals and he says, "Follow me, and I shall make you fishers of men."
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:48.860]   It's widely recognized that Jesus' first miracle was a wedding at Cana, where he's at a wedding
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.820]   and he's having some fun with his friends.
[00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.300]   And his mother comes and tells him off because there's no wine left and she knows that he
[00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.100]   can do something about it.
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.060]   And then he says, "Mom, it's not time yet."
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:04.260]   And then mom gives him the eyes and then she walks away and eventually he just does it
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.260]   anyway.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:09.940]   And that is widely known as Jesus' first miracle, right?
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.660]   I think this could be counted as his first miracle.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.620]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.060]   If you're walking in the streets or if you're in your office, you're working, and then a
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.940]   strange-looking bearded Jewish man comes up to you and says, "Follow me, and I will make
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.020]   you a fisher of men.
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.060]   Leave your family, leave your work, leave your commitments, leave everything that you've
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:37.820]   ever known, and follow me."
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.500]   They immediately drop their nets and follow him.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.100]   Isn't that a miracle?
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:45.900]   And it's not just Andrew and Simon Peter.
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.180]   Later, he keeps walking and he finds two other brothers, James and John, and they're working
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.180]   with their father.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.180]   And what do they do?
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.180]   And he says the same thing.
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.660]   They immediately drop their nets and follow Jesus.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:03.660]   Jesus' call to us is to follow him, no questions asked.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:08.940]   You see, the more natural response, if someone comes up to you and says, "Follow me," is,
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:09.940]   "Who are you?"
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.940]   And then it's, "Why?
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:11.940]   Where are we going?"
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:16.340]   But they don't do that.
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.980]   They just follow him.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.860]   And they leave their father, they leave their families, they leave their business to just
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.900]   follow him.
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:31.500]   Another interesting point is this, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:36.660]   So he goes to them and he asks them to drop all that they have, but to not to let go of
[00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.980]   who they are.
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.220]   He goes to these fishermen and say, "I will make you fishers of men."
[00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.180]   You see, we don't have to deny who we are because we've been made by God.
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:47.780]   We've been fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:50.140]   We've been gifted in a very specific way.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.260]   You have been gifted in a very specific way.
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:59.660]   You have been gifted experience, expertise, education in a very specific field, just like
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:01.940]   these fishermen were.
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:08.140]   And Jesus goes to them and he also goes to you and says, "I want you to glorify me in
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.220]   wherever I have placed you."
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:14.860]   He didn't tell them, "Follow me and I will help you shepherd a flock."
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.540]   No, he did that to Moses and David because they were shepherds.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.740]   And then he did the fishers of men thing to the fishermen.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:26.300]   And so the teachers, he will say, "I put you in a school.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.420]   I put you in education for the next generation.
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:31.420]   Educate them.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.420]   Spread the good news where you are."
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:35.220]   For the bankers, "Go and do that and don't steal money from people."
[00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:41.060]   And then he goes to doctors and says, "Be my hands and feet and go and heal people."
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:46.500]   Jesus is calling you wherever you are, whatever he has gifted you to be in, to give up everything
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:54.140]   you have, but to give him all you are, to live for him, to follow him.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.500]   No questions asked.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.300]   Immediately they drop their nets, their families, their possessions, their familiarities, everything,
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.040]   and they follow him.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.580]   That is the King's rise.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:11.440]   He's announced, he's approved, he's assessed, then he assembles a team.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.820]   So what does that have to do with us?
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:20.620]   What does the King's rise have to do with you sat here right now in 2020 battling cabin
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.620]   fever and the coronavirus?
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:27.420]   I want to share just the final few thoughts really just for you to kind of meditate on
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.980]   because I think all of us are different.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:31.980]   The first is this.
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.380]   Jesus needs to be announced.
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:43.220]   There are people in your life that he desires for you to announce his arrival to.
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:47.740]   There is someone that you are working with, living with, or hanging out with who doesn't
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.140]   know him yet.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.500]   And not asking you to suddenly start wearing camel's hair and eat locusts and honey, but
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.540]   it's your job to announce Jesus to them.
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:03.700]   It's your job to tell them that in this season of bad news, of hopelessness, that there is
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.340]   good news coming.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:11.580]   It's your job to be the narrator and say, "Hey, it's bad, but let me introduce you to
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.620]   someone."
[00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:18.900]   It's our job to prepare the way for Jesus to enter into their lives and then do exactly
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.820]   what John did and get out the way.
[00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.980]   But it's up to us to start by announcing first.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.500]   Then Jesus was approved.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:33.060]   And that message that God said about Jesus, if you've been baptized, if you've put your
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:39.620]   faith in him, if you live for him, that statement now applies to you.
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:44.140]   That the spirit of Jesus now lives inside you, that you now can call God Abba Father.
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.700]   You now are a child of God.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.300]   You are a co-heir of Christ.
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.660]   You are an ambassador for heaven.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.820]   You are loved.
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:57.020]   And with you, he is well pleased.
[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.020]   You have a mission.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:04.580]   It's not why you are loved, but you are loved and you have a mission and he is pleased with
[00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.060]   you and he approves of you.
[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.700]   So go, make disciples of all nations.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.580]   Go, tell the world about him.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.100]   You are approved.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.260]   Have that courage.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:25.300]   And finally, he comes to you now and he asks you, drop whatever you have, whatever fears
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.100]   and anxieties you have and follow me.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.380]   Don't ask any more questions.
[00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:37.980]   If you know who I am, if you trust in my name, if you trust what I did for you, then don't
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:44.540]   worry about these earthly things and just follow me.
[00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.340]   Why?
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:48.460]   You may ask.
[00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:55.260]   Because he is king and he is risen.
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:00.180]   And if you believe that, if you believe that once upon a time, there was a man named Jesus
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.860]   who lived in heaven but then came to earth to redeem mankind.
[00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:09.900]   He went onto a cross and died but three days later, resurrected and then ascended to heaven
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.580]   and he one day will come back again.
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:17.500]   If you believe that story, if you believe those events, then you do not need to ask
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.460]   any more questions.
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.460]   Follow him.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:27.460]   Can I pray?
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:42.180]   Father, I thank you that you, God Almighty, creator of all, deemed us worthy to even know
[00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:44.900]   who you are.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:51.620]   It is your spirit that revealed yourself to us.
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:56.260]   And in light of the fact that you are king, we bow before you.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.100]   And we pray that not only are you king of the universe but that you would be the king
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:01.100]   of our lives.
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:06.020]   That you would be the king of every decision that we make.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:15.220]   Lord, that in everything that we do, you are part of it.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:22.940]   And just like Jesus, who faced trials and temptations, we stick close to your word.
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:26.740]   We hide your word in our hearts just like it says in Psalms so that we might not sin
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.660]   against you.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:33.420]   We meditate on your word day and night.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.020]   But Lord, help us on the days where we find that hard.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:43.980]   Thank you for initiatives like one where we're able to gain access to your word in a fresh
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.980]   way.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:49.260]   But I pray now for every brother and sister here as they engage in battle, as they are
[00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.140]   assessed, as they face life's challenges.
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.940]   Lord may they be able to distill your still small voice in the midst of all these other
[00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.580]   distractions.
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:11.220]   May we all be gifted with the opportunity to be still, to know that you are God.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:15.420]   So Jesus, our king, we are flawed.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:21.460]   We're not able to do it every day, but right now we choose to follow you.
[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.380]   And we pray all these things in your name.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.020]   Amen.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:35.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
