1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,080
 - Hello everyone.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,960
 It's great to be able to see all your faces

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,640
 and also welcome those who are on YouTube with us.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,640
 Now today we're on the topic of embracing grief and loss.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,040
 And sometimes we don't think how we can embrace that.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,480
 But you and I probably have experienced

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,880
 some sort of losses in our lives before.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,960
 And there are definitely some more devastating one.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
 And I can list a few like the death of someone close to us

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,760
 or divorce in the family

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,000
 or the loss of mental or physical health.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 It might be infidelity or infertility or even miscarriages

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,240
 and there are many other ones.

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,520
 And there's also some milder losses

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,200
 like saying goodbye to college friends

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,760
 or having a mentor that has disappointed us

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,520
 or maybe we wanted to get married

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,080
 and yet we're in our 30s

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,960
 and we wonder if that's gonna happen.

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,320
 Or kids have moved out or we've retired

22
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,540
 or we're entering into old age

23
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,960
 and we're realizing that we're not quite what we used to be.

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,800
 Now, of course, recently for all of us, COVID has hit us

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,760
 and the loss of just regular life,

26
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,700
 we can't even do dinner outside in a restaurant.

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,720
 So big or small, we have losses

28
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,480
 and we often either spend too much time dwelling in them

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,360
 and never really getting out

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,920
 or we move on too quickly

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,200
 and we seem to just brush it aside

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,640
 as if it didn't affect us at all.

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,240
 Only to find that they actually come back to haunt us,

34
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,480
 making us fearful or living in anger.

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,120
 And so today we're gonna see how we can embrace grief

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:58,160
 and loss in an emotionally healthy way.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,960
 So let us turn to the Gospel of John.

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,480
 And in this chapter,

39
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,640
 we find that Jesus' friend, Lazarus was sick

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,920
 and he is the brother of Mary and Martha.

41
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,000
 So the sisters have already sent words to Jesus

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,080
 telling him that Lazarus is sick

43
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,280
 and Jesus loved all of them,

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
 but he purposely stayed there

45
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,800
 for another two days before leaving.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,640
 And by the time he arrived to see Lazarus,

47
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,680
 he was already dead for four days.

48
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,240
 Now, many Jews came to comfort Martha and Mary

49
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,720
 regarding their loss of their brother.

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,680
 And in verse 20 and 21, it says,

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,080
 "When Martha heard that Jesus was coming,

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,440
 she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed at home.

53
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,800
 And she said, 'Lord,' she said to Jesus,

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,800
 'if you had been here, my brother would not have died.'

55
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,580
 Then Martha told Mary that Jesus is asked for her.

56
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,080
 And she quickly went to meet him as well.

57
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,880
 And when she got to Jesus, she fell at his feet and said,

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,600
 'Lord, if only you had been here,

59
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,160
 my brother would not have died.'

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,320
 When Jesus saw her weeping

61
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,220
 and all the Jews who came along to weep,

62
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,220
 he was deeply moved in spirit and he felt troubled.

63
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:32,640
 Then when Jesus went to where Lazarus was laid,

64
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,640
 Jesus wept as well.

65
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,920
 He went to the tomb and asked the people

66
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,160
 to roll away the stone so that it would not cover the tomb.

67
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,380
 And afterwards, Jesus prayed and said with a loud voice,

68
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,760
 "Lazarus, come out."

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,240
 And the dead man came out with strips of linen

70
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,340
 and cloth around his face."

71
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,760
 Now this was a miraculous scene.

72
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,520
 Now when we read this,

73
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,960
 we see that both Martha and Mary faced a great loss.

74
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,180
 Their brother and their vast people

75
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,400
 to tell Jesus about it before it happened.

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,080
 But Jesus didn't come in time.

77
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,920
 And isn't that what happens to us sometimes

78
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,160
 when we are in a great distress,

79
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,800
 we ask earnestly, "God, please help us."

80
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,020
 But it seems as if Jesus had either ignored it

81
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,840
 or purposely delayed his appearance.

82
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,560
 And by the time he comes, it seemed like it's too late.

83
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,840
 Now, both Martha and Mary said the exact same thing,

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,160
 which were, "If you had been here,

85
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,480
 my brother would not have died."

86
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,000
 And don't we say the same things when we face a loss?

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 We say, "God, if you had only done something."

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,640
 And so this brings us to our first point,

89
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,800
 that in order to embrace grief and loss,

90
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,620
 we need to lament to God.

91
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,620
 We need to lament to him.

92
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,920
 Now, many times we think that when things happen,

93
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,280
 we cannot go to God with our frustrations,

94
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,800
 because you know what?

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,340
 It doesn't sound spiritual.

96
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,680
 And it's almost like as if it's not okay

97
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,880
 for us to be angry at God or to be upset,

98
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,200
 because well, you know, it seems to be disrespectful to God.

99
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,040
 And you know what?

100
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,000
 It also seems to make us look like we have so little faith.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,960
 So what we used to do is that we tend to hide

102
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,280
 our authentic feelings.

103
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,800
 And, but the truth be told is that there is anger,

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,700
 there is frustration, and we even want to blame God.

105
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,780
 And what we see in this account is that it's okay

106
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,280
 to have those feelings, and it's okay to bring them to God.

107
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,520
 And although it does sound like we don't have reverence

108
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,400
 for God, or maybe even sounds like it's blasphemy,

109
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,060
 but the Bible tells us it's okay.

110
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,060
 And the Bible is full of lament, a place of intimacy,

111
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,400
 where we can tell our deepest secrets and our sorrow,

112
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,560
 usually only to the person that we trust

113
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,080
 and feel most secure with.

114
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,680
 And God is that person.

115
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,340
 And the thing we shouldn't do is to pretend

116
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,840
 or hide our feelings from God, but instead to go to him,

117
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,560
 tell him how painful it is,

118
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,660
 and tell him all the regrets that we have.

119
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,400
 And we need to be honest and just fall at his feet.

120
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,200
 And in this account, we see that Jesus was gentle

121
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,000
 with Martha and with Mary.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And to Martha, he spoke words of hope,

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,560
 telling her that Lazarus will rise again.

124
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,340
 And to Mary and the Jews, he was so deeply moved

125
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,680
 and spirit and troubled that he wept with them.

126
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,840
 Now, Jesus wept, not because Lazarus' death,

127
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,800
 because he knew that he would be resurrected

128
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,280
 and he would rise again, but more likely he wept

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,560
 because he felt the sorrow of Mary and the Jews

130
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,700
 and sympathized with them.

131
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,080
 And so we have a God that sympathizes

132
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,680
 with the pain that we're going through.

133
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,920
 So when we bring our grief and our loss to God,

134
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,720
 we can rest assured knowing that God understands

135
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,700
 and feels your pain.

136
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,800
 And he, even though he knows what's gonna happen

137
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,740
 to you later.

138
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,080
 So not only is it okay to lament your losses to God,

139
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,000
 it's actually the healthy thing to do.

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,180
 And we actually come across many lamentations

141
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,340
 within the Bible, especially in the book of Psalms,

142
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,560
 where the Psalmist was just speak out his heart

143
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,780
 and tell God the struggles and have you forsaken me?

144
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,560
 That's what we hear a lot in the book of Psalms

145
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,320
 or in the book of Job, where he laments about his birth

146
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,960
 and he wished that he was never born.

147
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,040
 And so we see that it's okay

148
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,000
 and it's healthy for us to do that.

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,200
 So this is the first thing that we need to do

150
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,160
 to bring all those hurts and sorrow and pain

151
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,280
 and even anger to God.

152
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,600
 Now, I remember when I was nine

153
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,640
 and my dad was diagnosed with a serious illness.

154
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,600
 Then I later grew up to know

155
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,920
 that it was stage four liver cancer.

156
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,160
 Now, mom and dad went back to Hong Kong

157
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,920
 while I stayed with my grandmother

158
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,000
 and my sisters in Canada.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,360
 And at that time I prayed every day inside the bathroom

160
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,360
 with tears rolling down, pleading, God save my father.

161
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,160
 And I was probably like Martha and Mary,

162
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,520
 praying and pleading with every cell of my body,

163
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,260
 hoping that God will show up and save my dad.

164
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,340
 And six months went by

165
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,440
 and it was finally the time for operation.

166
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,440
 The operation was successful, but his blood wouldn't clog.

167
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,100
 And when we heard the news in Canada,

168
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,920
 it was the most devastating day of my life.

169
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,080
 And it still is.

170
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
 And somehow at the funeral,

171
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,800
 I was surprised that I didn't have much tears.

172
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,360
 Maybe it went dry, I don't know.

173
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,040
 But for the next 20 years after that,

174
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,900
 I would not be able to speak about him without crying.

175
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,480
 I will look at the letters he last wrote to me

176
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,000
 when he was in Hong Kong getting treatment

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,160
 and I would cry every single time.

178
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
 But I never knew that I did not grieve properly

179
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,540
 about this big loss.

180
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,740
 I thought it was just gonna slowly go away.

181
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,000
 Until one day God allowed me

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,480
 to go through some healing prayers.

183
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,820
 And during those prayers,

184
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,100
 I was led by some experienced intercessors to lament.

185
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,080
 And I even asked them, is it okay?

186
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,400
 And they said, yes, go ahead.

187
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,840
 And I remember that it was just me pouring out to God

188
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,760
 and I said, God, I prayed to you.

189
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,260
 Why did you not save him?

190
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,440
 Why did my mother stop the blood transfusion?

191
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,880
 I would rather have used every penny

192
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,400
 that we have on the blood transfusion

193
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,840
 and live on the street with him.

194
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,480
 And why didn't my parents bring us back to Hong Kong

195
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,280
 so we can spend his last days together?

196
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,280
 And I remember at those time I was just wailing at the loss,

197
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,200
 the regrets, the what ifs.

198
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,460
 And that was actually over 20 years.

199
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,060
 So it really allowed me to see that,

200
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,060
 you know, grief doesn't necessarily go away over time.

201
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:10,020
 And if we don't lament properly in front of God,

202
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,860
 then we might never really get over it.

203
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,860
 And it will actually harm our current relationships

204
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,300
 or our lives.

205
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,620
 So lament to God,

206
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,600
 whether you have a devastating loss or something less major.

207
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,440
 Maybe you've married to someone

208
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,560
 and the marriage is totally opposite

209
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,480
 to what you have expected.

210
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,700
 Well, lament and pray to God,

211
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,320
 why did I marry such a person?

212
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,400
 Maybe your child is married off

213
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,240
 and well, you can lament to God too

214
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,240
 and say to him, why are they not here for me anymore?

215
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,760
 Maybe you didn't get to go into the school that you wanted

216
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,420
 or pass the most important exam.

217
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,140
 Lament to God, why didn't you help me pass?

218
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,500
 Where am I gonna go now?

219
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,060
 And maybe you've always dreamed to have your own family,

220
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,780
 but it's still single.

221
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,380
 So you can lament to God,

222
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,560
 why doesn't anyone love me or like me for who I am?

223
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,860
 You know, it's okay.

224
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,740
 Go to your room, bow down your head,

225
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,740
 lament, wail, let your greatest frustration and anger

226
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,380
 let God know because he will listen to you

227
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,700
 and he will weep with you.

228
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,700
 He is gentle as we see in gospel of John chapter 11

229
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:39,180
 that Jesus listens and he weeps with you and he loves you.

230
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,360
 Now I know this is intense stuff,

231
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,420
 but I do hope that we don't brush it off.

232
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,420
 Rather it's grief that you have withhold inside

233
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,900
 because it will vest and you will smell.

234
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,520
 It will hold you in bitterness or fear or pain.

235
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,540
 And I remember after lamenting and wailing to God

236
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,060
 that I was released.

237
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,300
 Somehow the pain was released

238
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,740
 and the sorrow slowly began to dissipate.

239
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,680
 And if the wounds are cut so deep, it might take some time.

240
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,120
 It might take more than one prayer,

241
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,720
 maybe even a few months of prayer,

242
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,360
 but slowly you will begin to see that you can call

243
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,480
 and begin to be okay with this loss.

244
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
 Now, just like the loss of my father,

245
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,840
 I thought it was dogwood,

246
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,100
 but it definitely wasn't until I properly lamented.

247
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,680
 So now I can talk about him without crying,

248
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,720
 not because I don't miss him,

249
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,100
 but because I've properly released those emotions to God

250
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,540
 and God has comforted me.

251
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,060
 And by the way, and you know,

252
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,380
 Pastor John and the team did not time this sermon,

253
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,800
 but today's February 19th,

254
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,920
 it would have been my father's 73rd birthday today

255
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,600
 if he had been alive.

256
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,480
 And I see this actually as a gift from God to me today.

257
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,100
 I love you, dad.

258
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,020
 And I know that you can hear me

259
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,860
 as you're with God right now.

260
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,000
 And so I often think that we're like a bottle

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 and unless these emotions are released,

262
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 then we can't necessarily receive the healing from God

263
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,880
 and the things that God wants to do in our lives.

264
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,400
 And so the second point about embracing grief and loss

265
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,640
 is to recognize that God has a purpose for it.

266
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,740
 Now in the story of Lazarus,

267
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,760
 Jesus explains the purpose in verse four.

268
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,080
 And he says that when he heard this,

269
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,960
 which was when Jesus heard about Lazarus' sickness,

270
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,360
 Jesus said this,

271
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,520
 that this sickness will not end in death.

272
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:03,520
 No, he says, it is for God's glory

273
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,520
 so that God's son may be glorified through it.

274
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,800
 Now you and I have to understand

275
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,960
 that God is not playing games or entertaining himself

276
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,280
 when he sees you or me having pain.

277
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,240
 And God did not bring pain or sickness into the world,

278
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,080
 but that the fall of mankind from the garden of Eden,

279
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,880
 after sin has entered into the world,

280
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,080
 our world is no longer perfect.

281
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,080
 Instead, God is using those loss to help us

282
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,420
 and also to give glory to himself

283
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,000
 and to display who he is to us.

284
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,680
 And so we must know that each loss is not meaningless.

285
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,500
 It has a purpose.

286
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,280
 Now you might say, well, it's easy for the story of Lazarus

287
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,240
 because he was raised,

288
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,520
 so that was a good ending in human eyes.

289
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,880
 Well, I just wanted to say,

290
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,880
 just because the ending of your loss isn't what you want

291
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,200
 does not mean that there is not a purpose there.

292
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,200
 And sometimes we might not even know the purpose

293
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,400
 while we're alive.

294
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,800
 But what we do need to know is that our losses

295
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,760
 and sufferings are not meaningless,

296
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,080
 that God is using it for his purpose.

297
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,520
 He can use it and he has been using it.

298
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,360
 And that at the same time, he is doing good to you.

299
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,120
 And from Romans chapter 8, 28, it tells us that,

300
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,360
 "And we know that all things," and it says,

301
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,080
 "All things, including the loss and the grief that we have,

302
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,080
 "got worse for the good of those who love him."

303
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,340
 And a lot of times we wanna stop there, right?

304
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,000
 But it also continues.

305
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,280
 "Who have been called according to his purpose."

306
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,480
 We've been called.

307
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,060
 And it's for his purpose.

308
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:13,120
 And so what we see is that things will work together

309
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,660
 for those who love him.

310
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,840
 But many a times we ask, I mean, does God love us?

311
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,560
 Are we those people?

312
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,980
 And in the gospel of John chapter 14, 21, it says,

313
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,320
 "Whoever has my commands and keeps them

314
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,760
 "is the one who loves me."

315
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,400
 So his commands, what are those?

316
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,860
 Well, we know what those are,

317
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,660
 which is to love our enemies,

318
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,700
 to forgive those who have wronged us,

319
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,800
 to love your wife, to submit to your husband,

320
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,360
 to give to the poor, honor your father and mother,

321
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,960
 and all the more.

322
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,340
 Now you might be worried and say,

323
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,980
 "Wow, that is a really long list."

324
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,400
 But the idea is that we aren't perfect people,

325
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,580
 and we probably won't get all of them.

326
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,920
 But the important thing is that we have a heart

327
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,520
 to move towards wanting to do more of these things

328
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,480
 because we love God.

329
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,100
 And if we do love him,

330
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,300
 then we do know that we've been called to his purpose

331
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,800
 and he will do good to us through all things,

332
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,440
 including the losses and the grief that you're going through.

333
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,060
 Now, of course, sometimes we feel that the loss is so great.

334
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,800
 How can anything good come out of it?

335
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,660
 Now, maybe years after the loss, you still don't understand.

336
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,400
 Maybe you've lost your child or a parent.

337
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,980
 It's very hard to understand what good will it do.

338
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:43,600
 But part of it is because we can't see the whole picture.

339
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,780
 We're limited.

340
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,260
 And the other part is

341
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,560
 because we're defining good for ourselves.

342
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,840
 Now, of course, we would pray for prosperity, good health,

343
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,640
 comfort, happiness, and peace and all that.

344
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
 That's quite all right.

345
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,800
 But what if his good for you doesn't look like that?

346
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,900
 I mean, what if he really wanted

347
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,520
 to strip you of your old self?

348
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,700
 What if it's to build your faith that could move mountains?

349
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:15,040
 What if it's to make you stronger as a person?

350
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,040
 And what if it is to let other people see Christ

351
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,180
 through you?

352
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,800
 And if all we ever wanted for ourselves

353
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,320
 or someone is the good in our eyes,

354
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,320
 then yes, maybe we don't see how this can be good for us.

355
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,560
 But to embrace grief and loss is to understand

356
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,560
 that there is a purpose that God is doing.

357
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,280
 And through that purpose,

358
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,600
 there is good that is gonna happen to us.

359
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,880
 Rather we identify it or not.

360
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,320
 So have faith that your loss and grief is not meaningless

361
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,940
 and God is using them for his glory and for your good.

362
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:01,120
 Now, for one thing, many of us who has gone through losses

363
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,280
 and very similar findings is that their understanding

364
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,160
 and love for God deepens.

365
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,600
 Now imagine for me, with me for a moment.

366
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,120
 Now with Martha, Mary, and Lazarus,

367
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
 and all the Jews that were present,

368
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,360
 after having gone through Lazarus' death and resurrection,

369
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,360
 can you imagine their understanding of who Jesus was?

370
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,880
 The Messiah, the eternal God,

371
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,520
 would never mean the same anymore

372
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,320
 than if they did not go through this event.

373
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,280
 And also for Job, at the end of all the trauma

374
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,640
 where he lost everything, his children

375
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,240
 and his wealth overnight,

376
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,040
 and his skin was just covered with disease.

377
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,880
 And you know what?

378
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,920
 At the end of that book, Job said,

379
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,920
 "My ears had heard of you, but now my eyes have seen you."

380
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,040
 It's like going through that loss gave him a revelation

381
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,400
 about who God is that he never knew before.

382
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,280
 Now he claims to have seen God

383
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,500
 through this great loss, right?

384
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,540
 And many a times I think we're able to as well.

385
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,000
 Or like the first generation of Israelites

386
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,560
 who lost the opportunity to enter into the promised land

387
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,680
 that God has prepared for them.

388
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,480
 And they had to wander for 40 years.

389
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,420
 I mean, what good will that do?

390
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,820
 And you know what?

391
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,320
 That loss of not being able to go in

392
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,780
 brought to them a new generation of faithful people

393
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,760
 that maybe if they've gone in straight away,

394
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,060
 that they would have just forsaken God like right away.

395
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,900
 We don't know.

396
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,560
 And so the second step to us being emotionally healthy

397
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,880
 after loss or grief is that we need to be able

398
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,880
 to see God's purpose and that God's doing good

399
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,760
 through that to us.

400
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,320
 And for my dad's case, I mean, I still,

401
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,220
 I don't believe I can fully comprehend

402
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,120
 what good came out of the loss,

403
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,560
 but I'm thankful that he and our entire family

404
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,600
 became Christians through it

405
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,100
 and allowed me to grow in my faith

406
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,880
 because even if the outcome would not be as I hope now,

407
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,140
 that I understand God's sovereignty

408
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,320
 and I saw his providence to my family over all this year.

409
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,200
 And it definitely built my faith to a point where I believe

410
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,660
 even if things go opposite to how I've hoped,

411
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,680
 I will still trust him,

412
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,480
 that I believe that I still will know that he's here

413
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,780
 and that he loves me.

414
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:43,200
 So embrace grief and loss by acknowledging his purpose

415
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,800
 and that he's doing good.

416
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,960
 Now, the third thing is that we need to embrace grief

417
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,600
 and loss with an eternal perspective.

418
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,920
 We need to have an eternal perspective.

419
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,080
 Now, when we have a chance to work through our emotions

420
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,280
 with our loss, after having worked through those emotions,

421
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,960
 like the first point,

422
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,640
 and after knowing that he has a purpose for us

423
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,520
 and doing good, we must then get up and keep going.

424
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,840
 So it's hard.

425
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,160
 How can we get up?

426
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,980
 'Cause sometimes the loss will hit us hard.

427
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,540
 But if we have an eternal perspective,

428
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,440
 it will give us hope to walk on.

429
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,280
 And in Lazarus' story, when Martha saw Jesus

430
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,880
 after subtly blaming him,

431
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,160
 literally saying, "Why were you not here?"

432
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:40,200
 In verse 22 to 24, this is what it was said.

433
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,340
 "Martha said, 'But I know that even now,'"

434
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,180
 which is when Lazarus was dead and he hasn't rise yet,

435
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,440
 "that God will give you whatever you ask.

436
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,740
 And Jesus said to her, 'Your brother will rise again.'

437
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,380
 Martha answered, 'I know he will rise again

438
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,340
 in the resurrection at the last day.'"

439
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,260
 Now, even though Martha had misunderstood

440
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,440
 what he meant by rise again,

441
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,000
 but in the midst of her crying and lamentation to God,

442
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,600
 Martha had hope of eternity.

443
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,460
 She had an eternal perspective.

444
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,920
 Now, by knowing that we have eternal life,

445
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,920
 we don't need to grieve to a point of utter hopelessness.

446
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,620
 We don't need to grieve like those who have no hope.

447
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,620
 And in 1 Thessalonians 4, 13 to 14, it says,

448
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,720
 "Brothers and sisters, we do not want you to be uninformed

449
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,900
 about those who sleep in death,

450
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,340
 so that you do not grieve like the rest of mankind

451
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:51,020
 who have no hope.

452
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:56,020
 For we believe that Jesus died and rose again.

453
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,980
 And so we believe that God will bring with Jesus

454
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,680
 those who have fallen asleep in him."

455
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:07,460
 Now, you might say, "Well, I know,

456
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,900
 I know he will give us eternal life,

457
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,980
 but this loss that I'm facing right now

458
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,300
 might not be life or death, but it still is killing me.

459
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,180
 This feeling is killing me."

460
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,180
 So how can eternal perspective help us face the loss today?

461
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:28,820
 Well, the first thing is that we need to hope

462
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:33,440
 because there is an eternal God who loves us.

463
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,460
 We can have hope because there's an eternal God

464
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,300
 who loves us.

465
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,360
 Let me explain.

466
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,580
 Now, if we know that we have an eternal God

467
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,580
 who is gonna give us eternal life, then he must love us.

468
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,360
 And so even in the midst of our pain and grief,

469
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,020
 we do not need to lose hope.

470
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,020
 We can have hope in this powerful God who loves us.

471
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,700
 And we can have hope that if Jesus overcame death

472
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,780
 and give you life, which is the most precious gift,

473
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,920
 how will he not help you with the lesser issues

474
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,320
 that you're going through?

475
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,400
 And so we can have hope that God who loves you

476
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,520
 to the point of death will not abandon you

477
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,360
 at this time of your loss.

478
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,160
 And he's with you now, and he will face it with you.

479
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,200
 And what a security it is that we can have in him.

480
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,960
 And the second thing that we,

481
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,280
 when we have this eternal perspective

482
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,240
 is to have hope in our final destination

483
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,820
 and see that everything that we're facing right now

484
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,080
 is temporal.

485
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,280
 It is not the end.

486
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:56,500
 And so the loss and grief that we face today

487
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,440
 become relatively less significant.

488
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,580
 It will give us strength not to be consumed

489
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,340
 by our situation to the point where we can't even get up.

490
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:08,980
 Now, there are some people who lose hope

491
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,940
 and can't really operate in their daily lives.

492
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,140
 Maybe they've quit their job or become addicts

493
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,140
 of some substance, or some might even commit suicide.

494
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,580
 But if we see that we have an ultimate home

495
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,580
 that we're going to go to,

496
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,740
 then all these things that we're facing now

497
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:32,740
 are only temporal and that we can finally not live

498
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,980
 for these things or for God and not ourselves.

499
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:40,020
 And we can have hope in the future that someday

500
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:44,920
 that there will be no tears, no pain, no separation.

501
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,620
 And we can realign ourselves with the presence

502
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,300
 to live for God and to get back up on our feet

503
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,120
 because we know that these things are temporal.

504
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,220
 And lastly, to have this eternal perspective

505
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,420
 gives us hope that the story is not finished.

506
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,020
 Now, your story is not finished

507
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,020
 because God continues to write it until it comes to pass.

508
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,600
 Now, I don't know about you, but when I read a book,

509
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,180
 when I read a book, I often can't wait

510
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,660
 and I have to skip to the end of the book

511
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,380
 to see what the ending is.

512
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,580
 And if I like the ending, actually I'll go back

513
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
 and I'll start to read the rest.

514
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,260
 And it's kind of like that.

515
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:35,700
 And God has already given us the ending of our life

516
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,780
 and it's a good one.

517
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,260
 So the loss, the grief,

518
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,260
 might only be just one chapter of that book

519
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,780
 or even just one paragraph of this great story

520
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,780
 that he is writing in your life until eternity.

521
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,180
 So let him have that sovereignty to write

522
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,740
 in however way that he wants,

523
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,420
 because you already know that the ending

524
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:04,220
 is eternity with God, and that is a good, good ending.

525
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,980
 So trust that whatever happens now,

526
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,980
 between now and the ending is only temporal.

527
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,360
 Now, I don't wanna minimize the loss of anything

528
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,140
 that you're going through now,

529
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,300
 but with an eternal perspective of eternal life

530
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,140
 waiting for us at the end of our journey

531
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,740
 will give us hope as we go through our losses and grief.

532
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:34,060
 We have hope because God who is all powerful loves us

533
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,260
 and is with us until the end.

534
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,240
 We have hope because this is not our home

535
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,020
 and everything that we face is only temporal.

536
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,180
 And we have hope because whatever it is

537
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,560
 that you're going through is not the end of the story.

538
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,240
 And the ending is good.

539
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,820
 And so we can get back up.

540
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,540
 We can go and continue this journey,

541
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,860
 the story that God has for me and for you.

542
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,340
 Now, friends, I know that it's not easy

543
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,260
 to go through griefing and loss.

544
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,760
 And anything that we need to grieve over and lose

545
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,020
 has so much sorrow and pain and anguish

546
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:18,040
 and frustration and sadness tied to it,

547
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,040
 that none of what we've said today minimizes those emotions.

548
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,960
 And that is in the point of the sermon.

549
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,940
 However, if we don't choose, I mean,

550
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,380
 if we choose to shove it down the carpet

551
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,480
 or dwell in it forever,

552
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,440
 we cannot embrace it in a healthy way that God wants us to.

553
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,640
 So first, I really encourage all of us

554
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,480
 to deal with these emotions of loss

555
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,400
 by bringing them to God.

556
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,180
 And we can do that through just lamenting to Him, griefing.

557
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,480
 Just go to your room, close all the doors,

558
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,800
 and just say, "God, I can't take this anymore."

559
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,240
 Let Him know, don't be afraid.

560
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,000
 We don't need to pretend to be spiritual

561
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,960
 or actually this is spiritual.

562
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,760
 To be intimate with God is spiritual.

563
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,960
 And Jesus will cry with you,

564
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,200
 and He'll be with you every step of the way.

565
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,600
 He will be gentle with you.

566
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,200
 He won't call you names.

567
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,080
 He won't get tired of you,

568
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,840
 and He will hold you in His arm.

569
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,120
 And secondly, when our emotions have been let out,

570
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,340
 let Him fill you with that faith

571
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,160
 that there is a good purpose behind it.

572
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,560
 And somehow He's gonna do good to you,

573
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,800
 even if you don't see it, even if you don't understand it.

574
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,080
 Trust that that is what He said,

575
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,420
 and that He is doing what He said.

576
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,180
 And lastly, never lose hope,

577
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,220
 not like those non-believing people,

578
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,120
 because in your situation,

579
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:59,120
 the resurrected Jesus has promised you eternal life,

580
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,960
 and your story's not done,

581
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,240
 so let Him continue to write it.

582
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,800
 And I'm sure it'll be a good one,

583
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,420
 because God is the author.

584
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,400
 Now, brothers and sisters,

585
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,880
 I can definitely tell you that it's easier said than done.

586
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,840
 And many times I go through losses and grief,

587
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,720
 even maybe this few weeks as well,

588
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,280
 but actually by putting these things into action

589
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,320
 and practicing to do these,

590
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,760
 even with our smaller losses,

591
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,140
 that it has given me great strength and hope.

592
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,140
 So I really pray that by processing your feeling

593
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,820
 and having realignment of our perspective,

594
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,820
 will allow us to just embrace grief and loss

595
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,640
 in a way that is healthy,

596
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,680
 in a way that will allow us to continue

597
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,280
 to do the will of God.

598
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,320
 So praying for blessings over all of you,

599
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,200
 and I just wanna pray together with you in the Lord.

600
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,520
 So let us pray now.

601
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,640
 Dear Heavenly Father,

602
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,000
 we know that we live in a fallen world,

603
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,180
 and that there's so much suffering

604
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,660
 and losses that we have to go through.

605
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:22,920
 But we thank you, Father,

606
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,840
 for you are a God who sympathizes with us,

607
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,840
 and you're a God who's willing to hold us into your arms

608
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,920
 and just love us to meet us where we are.

609
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,160
 And I pray for those who are mourning now,

610
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,760
 who even have things that happened to them years ago,

611
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,000
 and they might not dare to touch it.

612
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,200
 But Father, we pray together

613
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,040
 that your comforting hands will reach out to them,

614
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,940
 tell them that it's okay to go to you.

615
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:05,480
 And Father, we pray that even when we don't understand

616
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,440
 your purpose, that we continue to believe

617
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,040
 and have faith in you, and give us the eternal hope

618
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,220
 so that we can go on, can get up,

619
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:22,800
 keep walking into the path that you have prepared for us.

620
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,080
 Thank you, Father, for loving us.

621
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,000
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

622
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,360
