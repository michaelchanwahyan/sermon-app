[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.440]   Thank you, Pastor John. I'm so glad to be here today and we get to continue on our series,
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.440]   The Living Hope. And Pastor James and Pastor Johnny were sharing with us the last two weeks.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.020]   And if you have missed it, please go back to listen to it. It's a really great series.
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.960]   And so today I'm supposed to preach on Chapter 3, and it's really, really long. And so I'm
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:38.760]   I have to kind of juggle through. And the first part was about wife submitting to husband.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.480]   So I plan to skip that this round, not because I want to, because it gets better at the end
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.800]   where it says that the husband needs to honor the wife. But because it's really on my heart
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:58.560]   and I just want to share the later part of this chapter from verse 8 until verse 18,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:07.000]   where it's a way for us to see the characteristics of what it means to be a Christian. Actually,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.120]   in fact, I'd like to ask you this question. You know, we've been asked, you know, many
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.460]   times and even ourselves, we question it, too. What does what does it look like to be
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.040]   a Christian? And so I'm going to ask you that question right now. What does a Christian
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:36.560]   look like to you? And I would love for you to type in some answers in the chat box. Oops.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.000]   Trying to see my chat box. Actually, I can't see my chat box. Hold on. But keep typing.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:56.720]   Oh, there it is. I see it. All right. It says being humble and happy. Good. Caring. Peace
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.480]   filled. Wow. These are great answers. Is that a beard and sandals? Oh, not really being
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.840]   like Christian. Like, OK, good. The light for Christ. Very good. And we we love these
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.760]   are such great answers. Feeling joyful. You know, we tell like our friends what what it
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.440]   means to be a Christian is to be a light for Christ. And then they will ask us more. What
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.400]   does that mean? Yeah, that's right. Hopeful. Yeah. These are such great descriptions. And
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.360]   so today we're going to look at it and see what Apostle Peter in First Peter, Chapter
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:49.720]   three, tells us. What does a Christian look like? And so we're going to start reading
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:59.880]   from verse eight. Finally, all of you have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.320]   tender heart and a humbled mind. Now, right here, straight in one verse, he gives us five
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.160]   attributes of what a Christian would look like. And it's kind of like the five facets
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.480]   of a diamond, too. And they're like hand in hand. Now, let's go through each one of these
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.560]   and we can use it as a limit test, you know, to see how much of these characters we have.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.360]   Now the first one is unity of mind. And some other translation says it's like mindedness
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.760]   or unity in spirit to really indicate that his people, when they come together, we all
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:53.040]   have a common focus. And that is on the Lord Jesus himself, his kingdom and his interests.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.400]   And that's what his people should be like. We're not thinking about ourselves all the
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:06.800]   time, but instead we're thinking about the people around us. And so the people are what's
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:15.880]   on God's heart. And so for this sense, unity of mind, it means for us to center and focus
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.720]   on what Jesus cares about. And let's see how we're doing in this area. Okay, are you ready
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:32.640]   all? Just see how much of this characteristics do we have. Now, on a daily basis, think about
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   the thoughts that are in your mind. Do you think about if you're a student, exams and
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.440]   homework? Or do you think about the guy or the girl that you can't seem to get their
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.440]   attention of that you want to? Do you think about the relationship issues that you really
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.640]   want to work on and resolve? Or the job that you wanted? Or are you thinking about other
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:03.000]   people that are that is on Jesus's heart? Maybe you know a friend who is sick through
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   a WhatsApp group? Are you praying for them? Are you able to give them a phone call or
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.800]   even visit them? Maybe you haven't seen your parents or taking them out for dim sum if
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.760]   they're in the same place that you live in. Would you give them a call to see how they're
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:29.000]   doing? And so this really the unity of mind is to be connected to God and to be thinking
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.240]   about the people around us instead of ourselves. So it's a great chance for us to reflect on
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.960]   that. Now, interestingly, the first and the fifth attribute of this list, if you look
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.800]   at it, speaks of the mind. Now, the second and the fourth speaks of this feeling that
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:57.320]   we'll have. And right in the center, Apostle Peter here speaks of this brotherly love.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.720]   And so we want to look at the fifth one now, because it's very similar to the first. It
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:12.160]   speaks of a humbled mind. Or in here, we will, instead of remember what we just said a moment
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.120]   ago, instead of thinking about ourselves, this individualism, we're thinking about other
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:25.840]   people, and really how to serve them. How can we better serve the people around us?
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.840]   It's really a servant attitude or serving mindset. And it's not really so much that
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.400]   we're thinking, oh, when we say humble, you know, sometimes we think it means to think
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.520]   lowly of ourselves. Oh, we're not good at this. I'm not good at that. No, no, no, it's
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:52.240]   not that at all. But that we are to put other people above us or their concern with me in
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:59.800]   our heart. And so let us also do a litmus test on this and see how we're doing with
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:06.600]   the humble mindedness by looking at how it is that we will relate to other people. So
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.360]   do we go to church thinking, hey, where's the cookie? Where's the tea? You know, or,
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.760]   or you might be thinking, how come no one's talking to me? You know, I've been here for
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:24.400]   like the fifth time. Or do we go there earlier to ask, how is it that I can help? You know,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.680]   is there anything that you want me to do to serve other people? So it's really about serving
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.640]   the people that we have around us. And sometimes, you know, we might be in a small group even,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.160]   and we might want people to, to demand them to read certain number of chapters. And it's
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:50.860]   not about that. It's not even about using certain materials, but to really be serving
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:57.560]   the people. What are the needs of the small group that you're in? What is it that people
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:04.960]   are going through? So this is the kind of mindset that Apostle Peter is calling us to.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:11.280]   Now this actually naturally leads to the second and the fourth attribute, which is to have
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:19.800]   sympathy and compassion. Here it uses a tender heart, which in other translation also means
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:27.360]   compassion. And this really is telling us that when we are serving the people around
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:34.400]   us, it's not self focus. And yet, we're to have an understanding for the people around
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.840]   us. You know, maybe some people are going through a difficult time, and we will understand
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.640]   be in their shoes. And not only that, but he asked us to be compassionate, meaning that
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:55.240]   we'll respond to that person's needs. And so this really is the call that Apostle Peter
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:03.240]   is asking us, or Jesus himself is asking us to have sympathy, to have compassion. And
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:11.400]   again, you know, let's see how we score in this area. Now, do we constantly find ourselves
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:18.480]   asking either in our heads, or maybe we say it out loud? Why did you do that? Why don't
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.960]   you do this? You know, maybe to some extent, we're asking those questions, we're already
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:29.020]   judging them, we're not understanding where they're coming from. And we're not understanding
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:35.400]   the struggles that they have. Now remember, when Jesus was forgiving a woman that was
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:42.480]   caught in adultery, we don't hear Jesus saying, why did you sleep with that man? But no, it
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:49.440]   was never coming from a high place looking down at someone. But instead, he had sympathy
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:57.480]   and compassion. And not that he agrees with the action if it's if it's wrong or sinful,
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:04.200]   but that he would be understanding. And he'll be right there walking alongside with that
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:10.680]   person. And that's the kind of attribute that Apostle Peter is telling us that a Christian
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:19.840]   would have. And finally, we see right at the center, it's brotherly love. Now this attribute,
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:26.480]   you know, in Greek, the original language is phileo, and is not the agape type, which
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.200]   means that it's not stressing on the point of unconditional love, but rather one that
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:39.880]   is a family, one that is speaking about a relationship. So that when we are doing all
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:46.840]   these things, having unity of mind, having sympathy and being humble, it's all tied in,
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:53.640]   because we're seeing these people as our brothers and as our sisters. These people are not random
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:11:01.320]   people, but they're family members. And so again, you know, we want to see how we're
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:08.800]   doing in this area. And we can think about it, you know, when someone is a little, oh,
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.120]   even when I say that it might already be judgy. What if someone's a little odd or a little
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:20.520]   different, and you find them hard to be with? You know, how do you react to them? Do you
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:28.320]   naturally just stay away? Or do you really try to make them a part of your small group,
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.640]   a part of your friends or circle of friends? And that's really what God's asking us to
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:42.480]   do. People might be different than what we like, but are we still accepting of them?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:49.640]   Are we still welcoming them? And so when we look at all of these attributes that Apostle
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:56.520]   Peter is telling us here, we find that there is one common ground. And that is the very
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:06.040]   first point that I want to share with you, which is a Christian is a blessed blessing.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:12.720]   Now when we see all of these qualities, one common theme is that none of these traits
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:21.080]   looks as us selfishly, but it's all looking outward. It's looking at the people and it's
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:31.680]   serving them. To be a blesser is what all of us Christian have been asked. Why? Because
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:39.120]   we have been blessed by Jesus himself. And we've gone through in the past two weeks about
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:47.200]   how is it that Jesus has washed away our sins and he's that living hope that's inside of
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:54.520]   us. And we're called to this priesthood. And this priesthood isn't just you doing things
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:03.560]   on your own, but it is for others, for people. And so Christians are called to be blessed
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:12.200]   blessers. And so I too, you know, often fall into the trap of focusing on myself and, you
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:18.680]   know, limited time. What, you know, how can you spread yourself so thin? But I believe
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:26.600]   that this verse is asking us and God too is asking it. Is there any area that we could
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:33.920]   focus on slightly less on ourselves and more on the people around us? Maybe on our time,
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:41.640]   our energy, our resources. Is there any way that we would mature in these attributes?
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:51.680]   So now let us continue to read on. In verse nine and 10 it says, "Do not repay evil for
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:14:00.480]   evil for reviling or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless for to this you
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:09.120]   were called that you may obtain a blessing for whoever desires to love life and see good
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:18.960]   days. Let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit. Let him turn
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:26.680]   away from evil and do good. Let him seek peace and pursue it for the eyes of the Lord are
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:33.880]   on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:43.080]   against those who do evil." So after seeing the general characteristics of what a Christian
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:51.360]   is like, how blessing other is the focus of our calling. We see a situational example
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:58.440]   here where someone does evil or they might even insult us or curse us. But in here it
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:05.760]   says clearly that we are not to repay them that way as they did to us. Instead, we're
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:14.600]   called to bless them. And there are two things that we see here that we are to withhold and
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:22.960]   four things we are to do. Now, firstly, it seems to be the easiest thing, which is, it's
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:36.440]   called us to refrain from saying evil things. Instead, we are to hold our tongue and our
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:43.160]   lips so that we won't say things that would hurt other people or to make them repay. Now
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:47.760]   I know every now and then you know you get that person who cuts the lane right in front
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:52.800]   of you, right? Or you get that person who budging so your line and you're waiting for
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.760]   the last 20 minutes. And you know, it's natural for us to feel like we need to say something
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:09.800]   out. But in here, in those moments, Apostle Peter is asking us to bless them, say a blessing
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.720]   over them. You know, maybe they're really in a hurry. Maybe there's something going
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.640]   on. We don't know. Maybe there's nothing going on in their life. But can we still just bless
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:30.080]   them? And in that way, we're able to be the blessed lesser that God has called us to be.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:38.920]   Now there are four things in which Apostle Peter here tells us not to do, to tell us
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:51.320]   to do, which is let him turn away from evil. Turn away. Not only that, but to do good and
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:57.520]   to let him seek peace and to pursue it. Now, I know I don't really look like it. But back
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.800]   in high school, I used to play basketball. And I just wanted to say, you know, the easiest
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.540]   thing is to pivot, you know, which is you just turn, it requires no sweat, you're hardly
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:14.800]   even running. And you know, we see these four things kind of intensify, which means that
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:21.880]   the easiest thing is just to not say anything. The second pivot, turn. And you know, right
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.960]   there, we're like, all right, I think we've done enough, you know, at least I'm not like
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:31.840]   paying them back. But he doesn't stop there. He asked us to do good. So I, you know, sometimes
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.520]   I think maybe next time someone budges in line, I can ask him, Oh, do you need a, do
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.360]   you need a hand? Maybe I can help you with some of your groceries, you know. So it's
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:49.960]   asking us to do good. And not only that, but then we need to seek peace and pursue it.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:58.280]   And so it just seems like Apostle Peter here asks us, when we are a blesser, it seems to
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:05.840]   not make sense when people have done wrong to us. But when we do it, he says that the
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:15.520]   eyes of the Lord will be on you. And that he would open his eyes on the righteous, and
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:23.760]   he would open his ears to listen to their prayers. But to those who does evil, God's
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:29.320]   face will be against them. And you know, I, you know, I think about this sometimes, you
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:34.760]   know, read the Bible. And sometimes it says, the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:40.320]   I don't know about you, but I think, wait a minute, my righteous person, is he going
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:47.000]   to open his eyes and, and be looking at me. But right here in the scripture, it tells
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:56.320]   us that when we do not repay evil for evil, and when we do good and pursue this peace,
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:03.520]   you are righteous in God's eyes, and he will have his eyes on you. And he'll open his ears
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:09.480]   and listen to your prayer. And the best part, or I think a note for all of us is that, and
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:16.840]   the moment we repay evil with evil, we're the one that's doing evil. And immediately
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:23.960]   it says here that the face of the Lord is against those who does evil. So the moment
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:31.440]   we repay, the moment God's face will be against us. Even if you're a Christian, as we have
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.320]   studied from the book of Judges, we see that Israelites have often just done whatever it
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:44.520]   is that they want, and God will put them into the hands of their enemy. And so here, just
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:52.920]   wanted to make a second point, which is the blessed blessers break the cycle of evil
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:20:12.880]   and obtain God's blessing. And so let us continue to read on. And so now, and now who is there
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:18.720]   to harm you if you're zealous for what is good? So right here, you know, it's already
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:26.240]   trying to say when you do good, the likelihood of harm being done on you, it should be zero.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.480]   And yet in verse 14, it says, but even so, you know, even if you've done good, you've
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.880]   helped the lady of the grocery who might have budged your line or whoever it is that have
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:42.720]   wronged you. Even if you were to suffer for righteousness sake, when you have done good,
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:50.560]   you will be blessed. So even if someone were to harm you when you're done right, the Bible
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.200]   verse here tells us we'll still be blessed. And in here says, have no fear on them nor
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:03.400]   trouble but in your hearts, honor Christ the Lord as holy. Now we think about it, what
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:10.000]   does it really mean? Does anybody know what it means? How can we at those time honor Christ
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.880]   the Lord as holy? Well, we read the top and a little bit of the bottom, we'll know that
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:24.900]   it means that we don't need to fear them. If we honor God, Christ as holy, he's the
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:36.760]   only person that we need to have the fear to revere him. And if he is holy, we will
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:44.840]   act not according to what people do to us, but we will act only to please him because
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:51.120]   he is the holy one. And we're saying he is holy in our hearts when we continue to do
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:58.800]   what's right. And here it says, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:07.720]   you for a reason for the hope that is in you. Now, if we've done according to what the Bible
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   verse says here, your opposer or this person that is giving you a hard time will definitely
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:23.240]   ask why, why would you do that? I'm doing something against you. Why are you not repaying
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   the evil to me? And it says here that we'll be ready to make that defense. It's because
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:37.080]   of Jesus. And I love how it says, you know, do with gentleness and respect because we
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:44.880]   can be saying to other, yeah, but it's because of Jesus. Or we can, we can say it in a way
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:51.560]   that it isn't putting down that person, but allowing that person to see the Jesus that
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:59.600]   is in us. And in verse 16, it continues saying, having a good conscience so that when you're
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:07.360]   slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame. Now, what does
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:15.520]   it mean when the verse says, having good conscience, it doesn't seem to link with anything, but
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:21.800]   having good conscience means to not have this guilty feeling. Why would they, why would
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:28.760]   he say that? It means that when you do things without any guilty, guilty feeling, having
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:35.360]   good conscience means that you've done the best of your knowledge, that when you're doing
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:40.080]   this, whatever action that you're taking, there's nothing that's hindering you. Hey,
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.440]   don't do this. You know, there's no voice in your heart that says that. And you know
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:51.480]   how it is, you know, sometimes when we repay someone and we're trying to be mean back to
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:56.840]   them inside of us, you know, there's a conscience that's almost wants us, Hey, don't do this,
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.640]   you know, but we, most of the time we just shove it away. Nevermind. I don't want to
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:06.680]   hear that right now. So really here, when is it having a good conscience is saying that
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:11.960]   when you're doing everything and there isn't that voice or, you know, you know, with a
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.880]   guilty feeling, you're not supposed to do this. It means that you've done your best
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:23.280]   to the best of your knowledge, acting in a right way. And you know what, when we do that,
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:28.360]   the people will be put to shame. And just like, you know, the easier example I was using,
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.760]   imagine someone budging into line, right? And you said, Hey, may I help you with your
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.640]   groceries? Let me hold that for you. I think that person for sure things are weird, but
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.880]   the other thing will think, wow, you know, I can't believe I've just budged in line.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   So this is what it's telling us. And so, and in verse 17, which I really love for it is
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:56.160]   better to suffer for doing good, if it should be God's will, then, then for doing evil,
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.880]   it really means that, Hey, you're going to suffer anyways. So might as well, because
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.840]   it's not like they're not going to budge. It's not like, you know, they're not cutting
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:09.480]   into your lanes. But in that case, why don't you just do it for good, if you're going to
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:15.680]   suffer for it anyways. And it's true. And just like earlier, we saw that. And if we
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:21.800]   do that, if we don't repay evil with evil, God will give us a blessing. And for sure
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:29.000]   it will be a better choice. And I'm verse 18. It says, for Christ also suffered once
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.720]   for sin, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God being put to
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:44.640]   death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit. Now, I just want us to kind of highlight,
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:50.520]   which I didn't hear actually the word for, you know, a lot of times we might be thinking,
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.520]   you know what, let's do good because we're going to get a blessing from God. But I want
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:03.680]   to say that is the result and not the reason. I'll say that again. Getting a blessing from
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:10.960]   the Lord when we do good is a result and not a reason. Now that is a huge difference. And
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:18.160]   how do we know? Well, it's very easy to know if something goes wrong, and you almost want
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.120]   to blame God for something going wrong. It means that we have this entitlement, we think
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.880]   that, oh, but I've already done everything I could. God should be blessing me. Why isn't
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:34.520]   he? If that is what goes through your head when bad things happen, it means that our
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:41.560]   reason for blessing others or doing right is so we can get something back. It's a trade
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:53.520]   off. It's a trade. But, you know, if something goes bad, and yet, we just continue with honoring
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:27:01.840]   Jesus, just like earlier the verse saying in your hearts, continue to say that he's
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:10.000]   holy, then this verse applies, which is, that's the reason you're doing it. The reason that
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:18.800]   you're blessing others isn't for the blessing that's a result, but because Christ has suffered
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:27.520]   for you and for me. And he was the one that's righteous, and he took on our unrighteousness.
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:36.880]   And he brought us to God, reconciling our relationship. And if that is the reason, then
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:46.760]   even when bad things happen, we can continue to honor God, because we have been so blessed
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:54.320]   by him. And so this brings us to the third point that I want to share with you, which
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:28:03.280]   is blessed blessers are the imitation of Christ. We're doing all this to bless other people,
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:09.640]   because we want to be exactly like what Christ did for us. And I love, you know, earlier
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:17.640]   how Adrian sharing, you know, she shared about how her baby imitates what they do. And, you
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:23.440]   know, we ought to think we need to be better babies. We need to be like babies so that
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:33.520]   we can imitate Christ, because he ultimately blessed us, and we need to do the same. And
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:45.600]   I want to share with you actually a kind of sad story. In 2015, it's on the news that
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:54.680]   Daylon Roof, who was a 20 year old, was arrested because of nine counts of murder at Charleston
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:29:01.360]   Church. Maybe some of you remember it and have heard this before. It was a hate crime,
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:08.440]   and he discriminated against the African Americans. So one day he went into church, and he shot
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:14.920]   random people during a Bible study. Now during the court hearing, some of the relatives who
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:24.480]   represented the victims forgave Daylon. And you see there is a clip here, but we don't
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:32.240]   have time to go through it. But I wanted to read one account of the daughter of one of
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:41.720]   the victims said this, and I was hugely moved by it. And she said this, "I just wanted everyone
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:51.880]   to know, and you," he was speaking to Daylon, "that I forgive you. You took away something
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:30:00.760]   very precious from me, and I would never be able to talk to her ever again. I would never
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:11.480]   be able to hold her again. But I forgive you and have mercy on your soul. You hurt me.
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:22.600]   You hurt a lot of people. But God forgives you, and I forgive you." And many other representatives
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:33.640]   also came forward saying very similar things, one after another. And one even invited the
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:43.400]   murderer, Daylon, to their Bible study and asking God to have mercy on his soul. Sometimes
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:50.080]   I think about it, you know, these Bible verses that we read, you know, talking about someone
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:57.840]   budging, you know, it seems like if it's an easy scenario, we can do it. And then we look
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:11.400]   at someone, these wonderful saints at Charleston Church, and we really see Christ in them.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:17.200]   And this living hope is in them. And when they said these words, for sure they were
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:27.280]   in pain, but they knew that Jesus forgave all their sins and blessed them. And Jesus
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:36.400]   brought them to God to reconcile. And they truly were imitators of Christ. Just as Christ
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:43.960]   suffered for the unrighteous, they too suffered for the unrighteous. And they were willing
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:52.920]   to do that because they received his blessing, and they appointed him to warn Christ, always
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:32:05.840]   being ready to tell people the reason for their hope. And so we have been too called
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:17.240]   to be the blessed blessers. We've been called to repay evil with good, with blessings. We
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:27.800]   may not have to face, and we hope not to face such a tragic situation. And in our hearts,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:36.920]   we also pray for the victims and their families. We just wanted to say that just as Christ
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:49.040]   did for us, we ought to do it for others around us too. Now towards people that we do evil,
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:57.400]   like the people there that we saw at Charleston Church, they were able to withhold their tongue
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:06.200]   from saying evil things. And they were also able to tell them about the living hope that
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:18.000]   is inside of them and how Jesus also forgives. I wonder if we're able to do that too. Maybe
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:26.160]   since, you know, maybe we can start small. When someone cuts your lane, budges in line,
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:33.120]   instead of saying cursing and rolling our eyes, we can bless them. Maybe it's your coworker
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.600]   who gives you a pile of work and takes your credit for it. Maybe we could continue to
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:45.880]   bless them and maybe even buy them a lunch. Maybe your best friend went after the guy
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:54.640]   or the girl that you liked. Would you still be able to bless them and say a prayer? And
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:59.520]   maybe it's your husband who promised you to fold your clothes, but the clothes have still
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:07.760]   been lying around for two weeks. Can you still cheerfully go an extra mile and fold them?
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:11.200]   That one's probably for me, by the way. I asked my layman if it would be all right to
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:17.520]   share and he said, yes, it would be only if you follow through with it. So I've decided
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:24.920]   to follow through. So I just wanted to say, start small. Start with our everyday life
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:36.000]   things and we can be what Apostle Peter is calling us to be. That blessed blessing. And
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.880]   people will then be able to see the living hope that is inside of us. Why would she be
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:50.840]   willing to fold those clothes? I know I'm probably getting carried away with this example,
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:58.600]   but even so, if no one has wronged you, we could still be a blesser. Remember those characteristics?
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:05.440]   I mean, we don't have to do this if someone did something wrong. We can just maybe spend
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:11.120]   an extra five minutes praying for the people that you heard were in pain through your WhatsApp
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:18.000]   groups. Or giving them a call. Someone you haven't visited for a while, go visit them
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:27.360]   at home. Of course, given that it's safe under COVID. Or just instead of investing your money
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:34.220]   and hoarding it, treat some people that are struggling. Or put your money to good use
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:42.080]   in terms of finding an organization that you find meaningful. And so I really hate for
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:50.200]   this sermon to be another sermon that you hear on a Saturday night. And so I challenge
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:58.520]   you to do one blessed thing a day. Whatever it may be, you can say hi to the guard, you
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.440]   know, that seems to be bored all the time. Because no one, you know, everyone ignores
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:12.440]   him. And I just really challenge you, walk away today to do one thing that you can be
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:22.280]   a blessing to others. And by that, I'm sure we're all imitators of Christ. And he did
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:28.360]   promise us that we would have a blessing, that we would have him on our side, and his
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:35.200]   eyes would be on us, and his ears would be attentive to our prayers. And I know he would
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:41.880]   do that. So I pray that, you know, this, we would not only have received the blessing
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:48.360]   once, but that we would give it to other and God would continue to bless all of you. So
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:55.880]   let us pray together. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for the blessing that you've
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:11.480]   given to us. Our sins have been forgiven forever. And we have an imperishable soul and spirit,
[00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:22.600]   all because the righteous dared the unrighteous. And Father God, we thank you so much for blessing
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:31.480]   us and we pray that we too would be able to bless others. That Father, we won't repay
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:38.520]   evil with evil, but instead we'll choose to do good. We choose to bless for no reason
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:46.440]   other than to please you and to honor you as our God. And so we will be imitators of
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:53.720]   Christ. Father God, we just pray that you would help us. May your spirit strengthen
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:38:03.960]   us, be willing to serve others above our feelings, to love those around us. Thank you for blessing
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.400]   us every day. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
