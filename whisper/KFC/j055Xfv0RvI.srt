1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 - Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,520
 Good evening.

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,520
 - Good evening.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,520
 - I love waving.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,840
 So we have been going through the first Corinthians.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,480
 If this is the first time you're joining us, we're on actually chapter two.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,640
 Today's topic, as you see, is judging righteous judgment.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,640
 Now, I remember someone asking me, "What does that even mean?"

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,040
 Okay, we'll get to it in a moment.

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,220
 But I do want to start by asking you a question, which is, how many decisions do you know that

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,320
 we make each day?

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,640
 Can someone take a wild guess?

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,640
 Just shout out some numbers.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,640
 - 10,000.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,640
 - 10,000, okay.

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
 - Two.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
 - Two?

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,640
 Two decisions.

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,640
 - Two decisions.

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,160
 - What to eat and what else?

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,160
 - What to wear.

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,160
 - What to wear, okay.

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,160
 So it's two and 10,000.

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
 - 20.

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
 - 20?

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,160
 Just 20.

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,160
 20, all right.

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,160
 - 100.

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
 - Good.

30
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
 - 100.

31
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
 - 100?

32
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
 Well, who else?

33
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
 - 20,000.

34
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
 - Huh?

35
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
 - 20,000.

36
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
 - 20,000, okay.

37
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
 All right.

38
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
 I like this.

39
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,160
 This is almost like an auction, you know?

40
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,680
 Too bad I'm not selling anything up here.

41
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,680
 But actually, we make 35,000 choices a day.

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,680
 35,000 choices.

43
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,600
 You're like, "Wait, when did I make that many?

44
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,200
 Who was the closest?

45
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
 Who says 20,000?"

46
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,680
 All right, but you don't get a prize except the acknowledgement of good job.

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,640
 All right, so 35,000.

48
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
 How do we do that?

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
 Well, think about it.

50
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,640
 The moment you wake up, you actually have to make a decision.

51
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,360
 Am I going to open my eyes or not?

52
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,560
 Then the alarm clock goes off if you made the decision to set it the previous night.

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
 Then you got to...

54
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,800
 Am I going to press the snooze or not or let it ring?

55
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,920
 And then when you walk to the bathroom, you got to think, "Am I going to have my eyes

56
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,640
 closed and walk there or am I going to have it open, okay?

57
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,920
 Am I going to have breakfast today?

58
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,320
 Am I going to brush my teeth before breakfast or afterwards?"

59
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,720
 So you see, maybe a little bit more than two.

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,640
 JP can make it with two choices.

61
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,920
 More than two is a waste of time.

62
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:32,240
 So you see, we have to make thousands every day and we don't even actually know it.

63
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,640
 But can you imagine if we're making them without thinking through what those consequences might

64
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
 be?

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,520
 You might think, "Well, it's not too much if I snooze it again, right?

66
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,480
 Oh, my alarm clock."

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,960
 But the thing is, if you snooze it and you oversleep just a little bit, what's going

68
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
 to happen?

69
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,560
 You're going to be late for work, okay?

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:04,320
 If you don't eat breakfast for too many days, you might get an ulcer or if not, stomach

71
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,880
 acid, so on and so forth.

72
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,580
 So you see, judgment or the choices that we make actually have consequences.

73
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:21,160
 Some of them bigger than others and some of them longer effects and some of them shorter.

74
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,040
 Now why do I want to bring that up?

75
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,880
 It's because as followers of Christ, and we need to make judgments.

76
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,440
 How are we going to be different than those in the world?

77
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,960
 You're like, "Well, honestly, Michelle, really, snoozing or not, does that have anything to

78
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:44,520
 do with me following Christ or not or what breakfast I eat?"

79
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:52,160
 Well, yes and no, because if we keep on being late to work, I don't know what kind of example

80
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,640
 we're giving to other people.

81
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,560
 And if we don't take care of our body and eventually there are some issues, I don't

82
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,520
 know what kind of message we're also sending out.

83
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,720
 So there's a question mark.

84
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,640
 But let's start with what is judging righteous judgment, okay?

85
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,160
 So let's start with the sound judgment.

86
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,840
 Do you all know what...

87
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
 How do we make...

88
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,640
 What's the definition of making a sound judgment?

89
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,720
 Don't worry, I'll give it to you.

90
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,180
 So it's really an evaluation, okay?

91
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,280
 So a sound judgment is an evaluation of a situation or a thing, okay?

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,120
 So you evaluate it and it allows you to make a decision, okay?

93
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,760
 But if it's a sound judgment, it's going to give you a favorable outcome.

94
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,440
 So what is then a poor judgment?

95
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,640
 It's actually literally almost the same, right?

96
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:59,520
 Which is an evaluation of the situation or the thing that allows you to make a decision

97
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,960
 what's gonna happen with the outcome.

98
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,200
 An unfavorable outcome, all right?

99
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,600
 Because we can't really see judgment, but we can see the manifestation of that judgment,

100
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 right?

101
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,400
 All right, so now let's come to what is a righteous judgment.

102
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,320
 It's very similar.

103
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,360
 So it is going to be an evaluation of the situation or a thing that allows you to make

104
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,040
 a decision, and now what?

105
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,080
 That will honor God and follow His will.

106
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:43,840
 So today we're gonna talk about how as followers of Christ we're gonna do that together, okay?

107
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,480
 So let us start by reading 1 Corinthians 2:6-10.

108
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,560
 So verse six it says, "We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but

109
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,780
 not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age who are coming to nothing."

110
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,920
 So the first thing that we see is that there is a message of wisdom, but it's among certain

111
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,840
 people, not everybody, the mature.

112
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,480
 Now what kind of mature people are we talking about?

113
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,440
 Is it those who are over 60 and now with their octopus card can travel with the $2?

114
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,820
 I don't think he was talking about that.

115
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:33,040
 Or does it mean that you have been at church for the last 30 years or born in a family

116
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,360
 where you're already a believer?

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,120
 I don't think that's what Apostle Paul here is talking about.

118
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,160
 So who are the mature people?

119
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,280
 How do we even define that?

120
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,400
 So we're gonna go to 1 Corinthians 3, verse one to three, and get a glimpse.

121
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,040
 So this is what Paul says, "Brothers and sisters, I could not address you as people who live

122
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:06,840
 by the Spirit, but as people who are still worldly, mere infants in Christ.

123
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,800
 You are still worldly, for since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you

124
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,080
 not worldly?

125
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,640
 Are you not acting like mere humans?"

126
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:25,640
 So you see, Paul is telling us that if we live by the Spirit, we're no longer infants,

127
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
 right?

128
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,720
 We're people who would be mature, mature people.

129
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,400
 So you see, mature people are the people with the wisdom of God, and yet they are as defined

130
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,560
 here people who live by the Spirit.

131
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,480
 So we'll get to a moment what live by the Spirit means, but let's just stick with the

132
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:57,240
 Scripture in chapter two right now, that in order to make these righteous judgment, we

133
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,640
 first need to have wisdom.

134
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,880
 And if we need to have wisdom, we need to have lived by the Spirit.

135
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,600
 Now it's one thing to have the Spirit in you, and it's another thing to live by it.

136
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,060
 And I almost wanna use the analogy, let's say you own a car, okay?

137
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,020
 You put it in the parking lot, and you never really drive it.

138
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,020
 Do you have it?

139
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,020
 Yes.

140
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,020
 Do you live by it?

141
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,020
 Do you travel by it?

142
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
 No.

143
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,260
 It literally has no association with you.

144
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,100
 So in a moment, we'll look at what live by the Spirit's like.

145
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,200
 So okay, let's keep on reading.

146
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:36,220
 So first seven, it says, "No, we declare God's wisdom a mystery that has been hidden, and

147
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,960
 that God destined for our glory before time began."

148
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,080
 So we see that God's wisdom, it's a mystery.

149
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,820
 It's not for everyone, it's hard to understand, and it's hidden.

150
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,780
 So only some people find it.

151
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,080
 If it's hidden, that means not everybody finds it, and it's destined for our glory.

152
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,720
 Verse eight, it says, "None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had,

153
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,000
 they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,600
 However, as it is written, 'What no eyes has seen, what no ear has heard, and what no human

155
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,520
 mind has conceived, the things God has prepared for those who love him.'"

156
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:27,240
 So what we find is that this wisdom from the Lord, okay, is not understood by everyone,

157
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,200
 especially the leaders, they don't understand it.

158
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,120
 It's hidden, okay?

159
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,760
 And actually, it's referring to right here, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, because the

160
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,880
 people did not understand that Jesus came to save us, to wash away our sins, and instead,

161
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,400
 they don't understand that he is the son of God.

162
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,580
 So that's the specific wisdom that they're talking about here.

163
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:57,760
 But a greater wisdom that we're talking about is God's wisdom, is that it's not being understood

164
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,880
 by the rulers or the people of this world.

165
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,120
 But who is it for?

166
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,560
 Who is it for, prepared for?

167
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,000
 Those who love him.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,440
 So now we know, let's recap a little bit, okay?

169
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:20,520
 Which is, God's wisdom is for those who are mature, which means they live by the spirit,

170
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,240
 and it's hidden, it's a mystery.

171
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,100
 And God has prepared it only for some people, and who are those?

172
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,600
 Who love him.

173
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,320
 All right?

174
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,080
 So now, this actually brings us to a first point when we think about, how do we judge

175
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,420
 this righteous judgment?

176
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,960
 How do we make this righteous judgment?

177
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,300
 Is that we need to have true wisdom revealed by his spirit.

178
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,880
 Because in verse 10, it actually says, "These things," which is the wisdom, "God has revealed

179
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,280
 to us by his spirit."

180
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,360
 Okay, and then we can go back to the first point.

181
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,320
 All right.

182
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,520
 So now my first question to you about this is, do you have wisdom from God?

183
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,000
 Who has wisdom from God?

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,120
 Put up your hand.

185
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
 Nobody here?

186
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,360
 Kind of, a little bit, I don't know.

187
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,400
 All right, well, in order to answer that question, maybe we can do a bit of a litmus test, okay?

188
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,760
 Okay, first, who has Holy Spirit living inside of you?

189
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,080
 Okay, got some people.

190
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
 Good, good.

191
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,480
 Now, if you're saying, "I don't know, I don't know."

192
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,480
 Well, if you have repented of your sins, and you have asked Jesus Christ to wash away your

193
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,760
 sins, and you have asked him to be your Lord and Savior, then you have Holy Spirit living

194
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,800
 inside of you, okay?

195
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,240
 So I think for most of us, this is not too hard of an answer, question.

196
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,760
 All right.

197
00:11:50,760 --> 00:12:01,360
 So the next question is, is, who here thinks that you're a mature Christian, one that lives

198
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,080
 by the Spirit?

199
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
 Put up your hand.

200
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,400
 Okay, we see half a hand, all right.

201
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,600
 Brave someone, I won't call your name out.

202
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,160
 Okay, you're going like, "I don't know, this is such a hard question."

203
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,560
 Well, how are we going to go on if we can't even answer like the first, what was it, the

204
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,960
 first verse we read, right?

205
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:31,360
 We can't even know if we are living by the Spirit, then the rest of it seems a little

206
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
 bit hard.

207
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,120
 Okay, all right, we're going to get to living by the Spirit.

208
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,600
 Well, you see, what they said there earlier in chapter three was that those people, they're

209
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
 not jealous, okay?

210
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,120
 You're like, "Oh, when was the last time I was jealous?"

211
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,200
 They don't quarrel, okay?

212
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
 They're not worldly, worldly.

213
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,440
 All right, I don't know if you're...

214
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,600
 How do I answer that, right?

215
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,280
 But let's try to help all of us.

216
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,240
 This is not meant for you to cry when you leave this room.

217
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,360
 But then Holy Spirit lives inside of us.

218
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,360
 Therefore everything is revealed through the Holy Spirit.

219
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,040
 All right, so let's recap a little bit, okay?

220
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:28,360
 If living by the Spirit means following what the Spirit or interacting...

221
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,360
 Remember I was using the parked car?

222
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,440
 It means we're driving or...

223
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,520
 Wait, the Holy Spirit is driving us, not us driving Holy Spirit.

224
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:46,400
 And that should show in our everyday life, which means we can also do a test, okay?

225
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,080
 Remember how we said we make 35,000 decisions a day?

226
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,260
 So we can think about that.

227
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,920
 When you wake up, when you want to press that snooze button, does it ever cross your mind

228
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,880
 to live by the Spirit?

229
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:08,440
 Which is like, "God, do you want me to wake up or sleep for another 15?"

230
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,160
 Does it ever cross your mind?

231
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,000
 Like, "Oh God, there's a shortcut.

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,040
 I can do it easier for my workplace stuff.

233
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,560
 I don't know what you do.

234
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,360
 Can I just take the shortcut?"

235
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:32,040
 And with everything that we go through, do we invite Holy Spirit to be helping us?

236
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,560
 Even as simple as like, sometimes you want to watch TV for five hours, right?

237
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
 Just sometimes.

238
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,120
 And you say, "Should I?

239
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,080
 Should I not?"

240
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,440
 Even things like that.

241
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,480
 Or you argue with someone at your workplace or at home.

242
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
 Should I apologize?

243
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,800
 I don't know.

244
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:02,640
 I mean, if we were to live by the Spirit, really what it means is just all the time

245
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,000
 we have invited Him to be a part of what we make decisions on.

246
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,160
 Remember righteous judgment.

247
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,600
 Not sound judgment so we get benefits, but one that would honor Him.

248
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,360
 But I need to stress on the point, it is not by our own efforts, okay?

249
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,720
 Because we might want to do something for God, but that'll never work because it's just

250
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,360
 by our own efforts.

251
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,800
 But it says here that it's revealed by His Spirit.

252
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,680
 So every time we ask God, "God, help me.

253
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,480
 I know you don't want me to watch five hours of TV, but I'm at four and a half now.

254
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
 Help me stop."

255
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,360
 Right?

256
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,760
 I know I'm supposed to apologize, but I don't want it.

257
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,280
 Help me apologize.

258
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,960
 So we need to live by the Spirit.

259
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,840
 That is the very first thing.

260
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,080
 Otherwise, we have no wisdom from God.

261
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,640
 So let us read on.

262
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:07,800
 So in verse 10, it says, "The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.

263
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,120
 For who knows a person's thoughts except their own spirit within them?

264
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,000
 In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,560
 What we have received is not the Spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God,

266
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,680
 so that we may understand what God has freely given us.

267
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:39,360
 This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom, but in words taught by

268
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,360
 the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with spiritual taught words."

269
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:50,440
 There's a lot of spiritual words there.

270
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,800
 And what does this really mean?

271
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,360
 I mean, it's Paul, Apostle Paul here is constantly contrasting between two kinds, okay?

272
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:07,000
 The world, human wisdom, and also Holy Spirit, and the words taught by Holy Spirit.

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,680
 And in verse 14, it says, "The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that

274
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:18,840
 come from the Spirit of God, but consider them foolishness and cannot understand them."

275
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,120
 Now we should not be in this category at least.

276
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,040
 We should have at least have Spirit inside of us.

277
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,480
 And those people though, they cannot understand them because they are only discerned through

278
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,960
 the Spirit.

279
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:41,720
 So you see, Paul, Apostle Paul here is telling us that only the Spirit of God knows the heart

280
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,680
 and the thoughts of God.

281
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,080
 Now I want to just pause for a moment, you know, because we talk about, "Oh yeah, we

282
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,920
 have Holy Spirit like all the time," right?

283
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,920
 But just think about this.

284
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:08,720
 The God of the universe, the creator of everything, places His Spirit inside of us, this regular

285
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,880
 person.

286
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,800
 It's like, it's so precious.

287
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,760
 And yet, you know, many times you just think, "Oh yeah, I hope God's Spirit's in me," you

288
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,760
 know?

289
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,120
 Like, do we even cherish it?

290
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,100
 Like I don't know what you cherish the most.

291
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:35,040
 Maybe some people are some models that they make, some people are cars and other things.

292
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,080
 What do you cherish?

293
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,960
 Do you cherish the God of the universe Spirit inside of you?

294
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,040
 Well that's just kind of, yeah, something when I have time I'll think about it.

295
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:59,000
 And I think, you know, we rarely take that into just a heart and say, "Oh God, you're

296
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 here.

297
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Oh my goodness.

298
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,400
 Like how is that?

299
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,880
 How does that even work?"

300
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:18,720
 But anyways, I want to come back here, but I want us to really just grasp how precious

301
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,160
 it is to have God's Spirit in us.

302
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,400
 And don't take this lightly, like through some words.

303
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,160
 And why does He do that?

304
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,880
 So that we can understand His heart.

305
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
 We can know Him.

306
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,360
 We can understand Him.

307
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,680
 So this brings us to our second point that if we're to judge righteous judgments, we

308
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,440
 need to judge with words taught by the Holy Spirit.

309
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,560
 And what is that?

310
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,880
 I mean, there are all these different wisdoms in this world, right?

311
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:56,840
 Now if I asked you, like if there's an issue, a major issue that happens in your life, what

312
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
 do you do first?

313
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,000
 I mean, I don't know how many people pray first.

314
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,720
 I mean, for me, I'm guilty of this.

315
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,080
 I call a friend, right?

316
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,520
 I call an expert.

317
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,920
 And I read on a book.

318
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,320
 I mean, recently or not recently, but I always do it.

319
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,760
 I Google everything now.

320
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,920
 I mean, I really don't know how people survived like 10 years ago.

321
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,320
 Wait, I was still alive.

322
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,640
 I was alive 10 years ago.

323
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,200
 But now, you know, everything's like, "Oh, I'll Google and answer.

324
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,960
 I'll find a book that talks about that."

325
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,520
 And I'm not saying those are bad wisdom, right?

326
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,880
 It's wisdom of the world.

327
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:43,240
 But when is it that we're coming across a devastating situation and we just go and say,

328
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,040
 "God, so and so said this.

329
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,600
 The expert said that.

330
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,480
 Google said this.

331
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,840
 And by the way, the pastor said this."

332
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,280
 But when do we say, "What do you say, Lord?

333
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,280
 What do you say I should do?

334
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,160
 And I only want to follow you."

335
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,440
 I mean, if you happen to use one of the wisdom of the world, that's fine.

336
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,000
 But what's on your heart?

337
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,040
 And I realize a lot of times when I struggle with something and I seem to not find...

338
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,920
 You know, I'm anxious and I don't know what to do.

339
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,880
 And I realize when I just take that time, when I close my eyes and say, "God, what's

340
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,880
 on your heart?

341
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,240
 What do you want me to do?"

342
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,120
 And I want to say, surprisingly, he actually speaks.

343
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
 He actually speaks.

344
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:47,480
 You're like, "Wait, is that me just thinking, you know, paranoid, like a sound from my head?"

345
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
 Right?

346
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
 But you know.

347
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
 Why?

348
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,600
 Because Holy Spirit's here and he will help you discern.

349
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,440
 That's what the Bible said, right?

350
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,840
 And I remember once when I was asking God, "How should I fix this?"

351
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,840
 And I'm pretty sure he said something along the lines of the Bible verse.

352
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,760
 And I was like, "Nope, that's not from God, because that's not what I want to do."

353
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,280
 And I even said, "It must be the devil."

354
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,640
 Because now I'm using like, "Fan jyun joi fan jyun," you know?

355
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,280
 He's trying to trick me, so then that person can get off the hook real easy.

356
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,600
 I don't think so.

357
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,160
 But you know, five or 10 minutes later, I'm like, "Wait a minute.

358
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:38,440
 Am I trying to say that the evil one is trying to make me reconcile and that's not from God?"

359
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:44,160
 I don't know if you know what I'm doing, but it's called mental gymnastic, okay?

360
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,480
 And we're really good at it if we don't want to do something that God tells us.

361
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,000
 Mental gymnastic, I'm just doing somersaults in there.

362
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,240
 But if we're true to ourselves, we're just like, "All right, God, that's what you want

363
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
 me to do.

364
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
 I will do it."

365
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,680
 Because why?

366
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
 Righteous judgment.

367
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,800
 I want to honor you.

368
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,240
 It's not what the world says.

369
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,480
 It's not what I want, but fine.

370
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,360
 And then you do it.

371
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,880
 And you know what?

372
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,160
 God gets honored.

373
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,640
 And you're moving along in the maturity of your walk with God.

374
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,880
 And that is what Apostle Paul is speaking to us about.

375
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:39,800
 So we need to go by asking God what to do, not people.

376
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:47,280
 We could ask people, but ultimately we are taught by his spirit.

377
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,040
 Okay, so let's read on.

378
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:57,360
 So in verse 15, it says, "The person with the spirit makes judgments about all things,

379
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,440
 but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments.

380
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,680
 For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?

381
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,040
 That we have the mind of Christ."

382
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:17,480
 So you see, the person with the spirit of God is able to bring God's perspective into

383
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,760
 every aspect of life.

384
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,840
 Now we're not rejecting here.

385
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,000
 So it says that the spiritual person is not only subject to human judgments.

386
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,640
 It means that they're not only going with human wisdom or human knowledge, but if that

387
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,200
 person is spiritual, the one that we've defined, then they're always going to be able to bring

388
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,440
 in God's perspective into the situation.

389
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,760
 But notice something different this time.

390
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,400
 The first two time it was about, the first two, or the first section of the passage was

391
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
 very much on Holy Spirit, right?

392
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,680
 But notice the last line here, "But we have the mind of Christ."

393
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:08,040
 You know, the ultimate goal of righteous judgment, the ultimate goal to be following the spirit

394
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:17,920
 and allowing the spirit to teach us is one thing, is that we will have the mind of Christ.

395
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,640
 Now I won't even ask who has the mind of Christ here.

396
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,460
 You can answer that yourself, because the first two questions was hard enough, right?

397
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:36,920
 You see, it's one thing to do something because the Lord has told us to.

398
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:45,800
 And it's an entirely different thing when we are united with him in the same mind.

399
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,460
 What he wants actually becomes what we want.

400
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,680
 His mind is our mind.

401
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,720
 We have his mind.

402
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,000
 It is no longer like, "I told you to do that, so do it."

403
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,160
 Okay?

404
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:03,880
 It is, "Because I already have developed this characteristics, and now I'm going to do it

405
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,760
 because it's already part of me.

406
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,600
 I have the same mind as the Lord."

407
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,160
 And that's a progression.

408
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:20,680
 You see, from infants at the beginning of this passage, if we actually live by the spirit,

409
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,940
 we're actually mature people.

410
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,500
 And if we're actually willing to be taught by the spirit in the things that we're not

411
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:33,480
 willing to do, we're moving along in that maturity line, okay?

412
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,560
 And to a point one day where we are going to have the mind of Christ.

413
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:47,440
 And that, my friends, is what we are called to be as followers of Christ.

414
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:54,720
 I mean, I want to say there's no point, including for me, to be at church if 30 years from now,

415
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,220
 we're still in an infant stage.

416
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:04,240
 And I'm only speaking this because I challenge myself as well, not because I think I'm already

417
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,040
 here, but that we're all going there.

418
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:17,200
 So I want to encourage us every day, what choices, what judgments are we using to make

419
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
 our decisions?

420
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:28,080
 Now, last night as I was finishing off the sermon tonight, I was preparing, I felt tired

421
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,580
 because I'm just a normal human being.

422
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,460
 And so I decided before I sleep, you know what I'm going to do?

423
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,980
 Okay, not pray.

424
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,980
 I mean, I've already prayed.

425
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,460
 Oh, maybe I prayed afterwards.

426
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,980
 I was going to play some Candy Crush, okay?

427
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,420
 So it was like 12 a.m., right?

428
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,420
 All right.

429
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,460
 12 a.m., I'm like, "Okay, I need to let my mind loose just for a little bit, okay?

430
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,260
 Maybe I'll play like three games."

431
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
 All right.

432
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,100
 So I said, "Okay, I'll play three games."

433
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,860
 So as soon as I logged in, played, and they're like, "Oh, you have a two-hour bomb.

434
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,260
 If you've ever played, it's a freebie, it's a bonus.

435
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,980
 It means every game you're going to have a bomb that kind of wipes out half of the things

436
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
 you need to do.

437
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,300
 Anyways, if you've not played it, don't worry.

438
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,300
 It's just a bonus thing."

439
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,220
 It's like for two hours, I need to sleep.

440
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,620
 Okay, so I thought to myself, "Just three to five games, you know, relax a little bit."

441
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,740
 I'm playing, playing, and it's like 12, 15.

442
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,980
 Oh, 15.

443
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,980
 Maybe two more games.

444
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,300
 All right, so I play, play, play, play.

445
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,620
 And I was like, "Wait a minute.

446
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:46,420
 I need to give a sermon on righteous judgment, to honoring God, to following His will."

447
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,820
 And I'm telling everybody, you know, don't press the snooze button or be on time, you

448
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,300
 know, eat healthy, sleep early, and do the things that the Lord wants us to do, right?

449
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:59,300
 I'm like, "12, 30."

450
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,420
 So I'm like, "Wait a minute.

451
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,260
 This will really serve well if I can put it into the sermon.

452
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,180
 So if I can stop right now, it's still good, right?

453
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:16,100
 12, 40."

454
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:22,380
 And all of a sudden, I realize, I was like, "Wait a minute.

455
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,500
 All this time, I have wanted to follow God.

456
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,980
 But what does the Bible say?

457
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,100
 By His spirit, not by yourself."

458
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,020
 So I prayed to God, "God, please help me.

459
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,860
 This is the last game and I need to turn this off.

460
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,780
 Please help me, okay?"

461
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,940
 So there I was, right when I finished.

462
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,860
 I just like exit.

463
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:54,180
 I don't know why I couldn't do it like the previous 40 minutes, you know, and I just

464
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,180
 exit.

465
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,940
 And I was like, "Bingo, this goes into the sermon."

466
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,700
 Because I realized, why do we fail so many times?

467
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,940
 It's because we, if we even tried, was by our own efforts.

468
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,620
 I need to stop playing this.

469
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,980
 I need to do that.

470
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,780
 I need to apologize.

471
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,100
 I need to like reconcile.

472
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,100
 I need to do this.

473
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,980
 I need to love my enemy.

474
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,780
 But what are we doing it by?

475
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,780
 Our own efforts.

476
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:28,860
 I mean, it's a good intention, I think.

477
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:35,260
 But I realized, "Oh my goodness, the moment I prayed was the moment that it happened."

478
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:43,600
 And so I realized how little we even depend on God to just try to be followers of Him.

479
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,500
 Maybe that's why we failed.

480
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:54,580
 But I think today, Apostle Paul is reminding us also that the wisdom to even follow, to

481
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:03,980
 know Him, to follow Him, is not by us, not by our efforts, but our invitation.

482
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:06,860
 "Lord, help me do this.

483
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,020
 This is what you want.

484
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,540
 Lord, what should I do in this difficult situation?"

485
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,540
 Inviting Him.

486
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:23,300
 And eventually, I do believe that all of us will have the mind of Christ.

487
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,300
 So I don't know about you.

488
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:31,740
 I mean, how many times or how truly...

489
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:35,020
 I'm sure we have intentions to be followers, right?

490
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,540
 Otherwise, you would not be here on a Saturday night.

491
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,500
 You would not be online watching.

492
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,980
 Intentions is one thing, right?

493
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,060
 But Holy Spirit is a whole other different world.

494
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,500
 It brings us to spiritual realities.

495
00:31:52,500 --> 00:32:03,420
 It brings us to the heart of God and the strength to do what He asks us.

496
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,580
 So as we close, we're going to sing a response song, "Spirit Breakout."

497
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:18,020
 And I really just wanted us to, not like me for 40 minutes trying to do it on my own,

498
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:27,940
 but always invite Him from the smallest decisions, opening my eyes, to when I go to bed, still

499
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:34,340
 working on that, but not by ourselves.

500
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,140
 Can we depend on Him more?

501
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,380
 Can we invite Him in more?

502
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,500
 Can we live by the Spirit instead of park Him at the parking lot and then do our thing

503
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,300
 and wonder why nothing's working out?

504
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,020
 I think we can all do that.

505
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:56,880
 And I hope my little failure/at the end success reminds you.

506
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:04,620
 Maybe there are things you want to change for the Lord and it's taken forever.

507
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,980
 Maybe we all need to just depend on the Holy Spirit.

508
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:15,060
 If we have a willingness, if we ask Him, because He already lives in here, right?

509
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:22,060
 We only go for a ride with Him, He's going to take us to places we've never been to before,

510
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:27,660
 to understand the Father's heart, His will, and to make righteous judgments that at the

511
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:36,220
 end people will know that we are Christ's followers and that God will have all the honor

512
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:39,460
 because He did it the whole way, right?

513
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,460
 Okay.

514
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:46,020
 So let us pray together and ask God to help us.

515
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:55,860
 Dear Heavenly Father, you know our hearts and I really believe that all of us sitting

516
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:03,900
 here or watching online, that we have a desire to follow you.

517
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:13,740
 And yet Father, sometimes we're not even holding onto the most precious thing, your Spirit

518
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,500
 living inside of us.

519
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:23,020
 And we might not even ask you to help.

520
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:28,220
 And Father, today you remind us that we're not here to make judgments so that we can

521
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:33,620
 live well and have a sound outcome.

522
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:42,820
 We're here because we hope that whatever decisions we make will ultimately glorify and honor

523
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,500
 you.

524
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:49,620
 Ones that are in alignment with your will.

525
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:57,820
 And we pray, Father, that as we forget sometimes, or maybe we're lazy sometimes, that you continue

526
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,940
 to just help us, even as we just say, "Help us, Lord."

527
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,620
 As simple as that.

528
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,820
 And that's when your Holy Spirit comes into our lives.

529
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:16,260
 It changes our decisions and we'll make good judgments because of you.

530
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:23,380
 So Father, we pray that all of us now just want to open up ourselves and say, "Spirit,

531
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,860
 help us.

532
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,860
 Change us.

533
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,580
 Break us down."

534
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:35,940
 So that we, as followers of Christ, are not doing it by ourselves, but we're totally dependent

535
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
 on you.

536
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:42,500
 We invite you, Father, to do whatever it is that you want in our lives so that we can

537
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,300
 make good, righteous judgments.

538
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,740
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

539
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:58,740
