1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,500
 Father, we thank you.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,660
 We thank you because you are here with us.

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,780
 We thank you that you are constantly working,

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,940
 even when we don't see it or don't feel it.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,900
 Lord, would you be here tonight and move in our hearts?

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,940
 We thank you that Pastors John and Sandra

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,100
 have arrived in London safely.

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,820
 We pray for the next few months, Lord,

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:35,340
 that it would be filled with you, filled with you,

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,260
 and that you would refresh them and restore them as well.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,220
 We also remember on this day, September 11th,

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,660
 just 20 years ago, Lord, when we were reminded

14
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:52,520
 of the depravity of man, the brokenness of this world,

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,740
 the darkness that surrounds us.

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,620
 And we pray, we pray, Lord, that you,

17
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,900
 the light of the world, will shine your light

18
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,340
 into the darkness and that you would give us hope

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:07,140
 and that you would bring hope to each and every one

20
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,100
 in this world.

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,680
 And it's in your name we pray, amen.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,100
 Do you remember where you were 20 years ago,

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,140
 September 11th?

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,060
 Some of you maybe were not born yet.

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,460
 (audience laughing)

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,060
 Maybe, oh, I remember it well, in the womb of my mother.

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,660
 I remember, I was, I guess I was 15.

28
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,500
 I was 15 and it was, just after school,

29
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,860
 for me in England, my family had travelled

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,020
 to New York the summer before.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,940
 And I remember just coming from England.

32
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,020
 England, we don't really have tall towers.

33
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,820
 And seeing the World Trade Center was the tallest

34
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,380
 of them all in my eyes.

35
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,300
 And I just remember just completely just overwhelmed

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,660
 by just, wow, the creation of man,

37
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,860
 how incredible man is.

38
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,660
 And I remember just opposite the World Trade Center,

39
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,300
 there was a great department store called Century 21.

40
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,740
 Those of you who are Americans would know that.

41
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,660
 Great bargain deals.

42
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,740
 And yeah, and then that day happened.

43
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,660
 I remember being at home, we'd just got home from school

44
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,980
 and just hearing about it.

45
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,500
 And just going, what on earth is happening?

46
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,300
 And then the next day we got to school,

47
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,620
 I heard that one of my friends,

48
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,120
 his father was actually in the building.

49
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,940
 And then, you know what?

50
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,420
 And this is where I feel bad.

51
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,860
 I remember feeling like, oh my goodness,

52
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,340
 my friend's dad is there.

53
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,420
 And then I don't remember anymore.

54
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,060
 I don't remember asking anymore.

55
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,060
 And I can only imagine what happened to my friend's life

56
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,660
 at that moment, but as a young teenager,

57
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,460
 it just completely flew by.

58
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,580
 And it made me question, though.

59
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,580
 It made me question back then.

60
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,660
 And for those of you who may be too young,

61
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,180
 just to give you a bit of a picture,

62
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,900
 it was a nightmare of a few weeks.

63
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,100
 It was a terrible time.

64
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,140
 Back then, there was racism, there was terrorism,

65
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,300
 there was violence, there was persecution.

66
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,600
 Yeah, it's about the same as now.

67
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,540
 And I remember asking the question,

68
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,260
 and actually, it ended up not being me

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,580
 that asked it properly.

70
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,580
 It was the great theologian, Will.i.am,

71
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,980
 and the Black Eyed Peas.

72
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,340
 They ended up penning a song in response

73
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,140
 to the incidents of 9/11.

74
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,980
 And what was the song called?

75
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,460
 Does anyone know?

76
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,300
 Where is the Love?

77
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,460
 One of my favourite songs.

78
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,700
 My brother and I would use to rap it,

79
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,540
 and we would know all the lyrics.

80
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,380
 In fact, I think I still remember some of the lyrics.

81
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,100
 My favourite verse was the third verse.

82
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,900
 I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders.

83
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,580
 As I'm getting older, people get colder.

84
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,940
 Most of us only care about money-making.

85
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,740
 Selfishness got us following in the wrong direction.

86
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,140
 Wrong information always shown by the media.

87
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,180
 Negative images is the main criteria.

88
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:50,460
 Kids want to act like what they see in the cinema.

89
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,020
 Something else, something else, something else.

90
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,780
 Whatever happened to the values of humanity?

91
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,740
 Whatever happened to the fairness in equality?

92
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,980
 Instead of spreading love, we're spreading animosity.

93
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,460
 Lack of understanding leading us away from unity.

94
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,780
 That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under.

95
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,820
 That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down.

96
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,060
 That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under.

97
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,280
 Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found.

98
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
 So where is the love?

99
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,460
 And I want to bring that up today,

100
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:22,140
 because that's the question of today.

101
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,860
 Where is the love?

102
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,340
 Seemingly all those things that happened 20 years ago

103
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,260
 are happening right now.

104
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,060
 And that's the question I wanted to focus on

105
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,980
 in the passage that Carmen so beautifully read,

106
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,340
 finished with this verse in verse five

107
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,620
 that I really wanted to focus the most on today.

108
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,060
 But before that, there's a question that I wanted to ask

109
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,020
 that builds on where is the love.

110
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,100
 And for me, the question that has been on my heart

111
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,700
 these last few weeks is where is the church?

112
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,740
 As the world is tearing apart,

113
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,460
 as globalisation shrunk the world,

114
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,500
 but now we are almost even more distanced from each other,

115
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,780
 where is the church?

116
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,580
 What should the church be doing?

117
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,620
 Where are we?

118
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,660
 We as the church, how should we be living?

119
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,340
 But yet, as the world is tearing itself apart,

120
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,180
 I've got to say, sometimes the church

121
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,460
 is constantly tearing itself apart as well.

122
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,300
 And then I'm wondering, what good are we?

123
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,260
 Where is the love in the church?

124
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,860
 And this is where we come to the word of God

125
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,580
 and we humble ourselves before the word of God

126
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,260
 because we say, God, we don't know.

127
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,580
 We've tried.

128
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,500
 We think we know.

129
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,140
 We think we've developed wisdom,

130
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,260
 but the wisdom of man is still nothing

131
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,660
 and is still compared, is foolishness compared to God.

132
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,220
 And then we ask ourselves, so how should we do church?

133
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,740
 And then I look into the word

134
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,500
 and I go into this book of Timothy.

135
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,220
 This book of Timothy, which was written by Paul

136
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,220
 probably in the 80s, 60s.

137
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,580
 And he wrote two letters to Timothy,

138
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,500
 one Timothy, two Timothy,

139
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,740
 and he wrote one to Titus as well.

140
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,820
 These were his young mentees and he was writing them

141
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,220
 and they're called the pastoral letters,

142
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,500
 the pastoral epistles.

143
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,740
 And really what one Timothy and two Timothy are about are,

144
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,700
 it's a church handbook.

145
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,340
 It's a church handbook and it's telling Timothy

146
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,860
 how to lead the church.

147
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,820
 What should the church look like?

148
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,900
 And it deals with very important topics.

149
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,820
 Now, you won't hear Timothy preach in church that often

150
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,860
 because it has topics that most of us preachers

151
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,700
 sometimes would like to avoid.

152
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,500
 It talks about money, it talks about sex,

153
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,340
 it talks about gender roles, it talks about authority.

154
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,980
 And yet I feel deeply on my heart

155
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,460
 as we ask the same question

156
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,060
 that Will.i.am asked 20 years ago,

157
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,900
 that we also need to turn it on ourselves

158
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,860
 and ask ourselves that question,

159
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,220
 where is the love?

160
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,460
 Where is the church?

161
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,180
 Where is the love in the church?

162
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,940
 And so we look at this book

163
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,580
 and we ask ourselves, God, show us,

164
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,900
 not just for KFCI, but for Kung Fu,

165
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,340
 not just for Kung Fu, but for the church of Hong Kong,

166
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,540
 not just for the church of Hong Kong,

167
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,580
 but for the church of the world.

168
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,940
 What does the church have to say in a time like this?

169
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,420
 And as we go through these few months,

170
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,380
 we're gonna go through one and two, Timothy,

171
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,060
 that's my encouragement to you.

172
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,540
 Ask yourself that question.

173
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,100
 Where is the church?

174
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,460
 And is there love in the church?

175
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,180
 Surely that's the one thing we should be known by.

176
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,980
 You look at Jesus in John 13,

177
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,460
 he says, I'm gonna give you a new commandment.

178
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,700
 If you forget everything else,

179
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,340
 I want you to remember what?

180
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,620
 Love one another.

181
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,860
 He prays in John 17, Lord, would they just be as one?

182
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,700
 Would they love each other?

183
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,420
 It's because only when they do,

184
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,660
 only when they are together and in harmony,

185
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,460
 will the world believe in me.

186
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,380
 And then Jesus sums up the whole of God's command

187
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,820
 in Matthew 22.

188
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,620
 Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind,

189
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,420
 and love your neighbour as yourself.

190
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,620
 Love, love, love.

191
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,860
 It's not just the black-eyed bees.

192
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,300
 It's not just the Beatles.

193
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,340
 It's everything.

194
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,620
 Love is the beginning and end of everything.

195
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,100
 And this is where we land on the verse

196
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,700
 that I'm gonna be focusing on today.

197
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,980
 1 Timothy 1, verse five says this.

198
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,500
 The aim of our charge is love,

199
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,020
 but issues from a pure heart,

200
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,940
 a good conscience, and a sincere faith.

201
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
 That's it.

202
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,340
 You see, as we look at scripture,

203
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,900
 Paul's gonna tell Timothy a whole ton of stuff.

204
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,900
 But he starts by saying, hey, as I charge,

205
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,140
 and he's gonna charge Timothy with a lot of things,

206
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,820
 not charge in the sense that Timothy's guilty

207
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,900
 and he's being charged, but he commands Timothy.

208
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,420
 He charges him to uphold truth.

209
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,100
 He charges him to serve.

210
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,820
 He charges him to lead.

211
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,060
 And as he charges him with all these different things,

212
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,060
 he says, the aim of our charge is love,

213
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,500
 that issues from a pure heart,

214
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
 a good conscience, and a sincere faith.

215
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,980
 And I wanted just to crack that open a little bit.

216
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,860
 What does that actually mean?

217
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,380
 What is the aim of our charge?

218
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,340
 What's the point of it?

219
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,500
 So there's two things I wanna do this evening.

220
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,820
 One is I wanna set the scene.

221
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,860
 As we look into 1 and 2 Timothy, I wanna set the scene.

222
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,700
 That's number one.

223
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,940
 And the second thing I wanna do is to set the goal,

224
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,020
 set the scene, and set the goal.

225
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,980
 Is that good?

226
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,820
 Are you tracking with me?

227
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,260
 So from here, first of all,

228
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,100
 I will start with setting the scene.

229
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,220
 Paul writes this letter to Timothy around the AD 60s.

230
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,020
 Let me tell you a little bit about Timothy.

231
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,100
 Timothy was actually a fascinating person for me.

232
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,460
 He's writing to Timothy right now,

233
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,620
 and Timothy is around my age, okay, 21.

234
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,900
 Okay, oh.

235
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,100
 You know what, you guys didn't laugh,

236
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,380
 which means you may have believed it.

237
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,340
 Wow.

238
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
 Vincent, welcome back.

239
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,900
 So he's writing to Timothy, he's about in his mid-30s,

240
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,700
 but he met Timothy a bit earlier than that.

241
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,500
 He met Timothy on his first missionary journey to Lystra,

242
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,220
 and that's probably where Timothy accepts Christ,

243
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,900
 and that was when he was very, very young.

244
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,780
 And then later on, on his second journey,

245
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,700
 he meets Timothy again, and we see this in Acts 16.

246
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,300
 He meets Timothy, and by then,

247
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,340
 Timothy's probably around 15 years old.

248
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,700
 He's a teenager.

249
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,820
 But Timothy is very well spoken of in the community.

250
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,580
 And so Paul takes him under his wing around 15 and says,

251
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,460
 "Hey, you come with me.

252
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,780
 "Come with me, and I'll mentor you."

253
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,580
 And Timothy becomes his protege,

254
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,380
 and he says in the very beginning of 1 Timothy 1,

255
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,860
 Paul treats Timothy like his son.

256
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,140
 He says he's my one true son in the faith,

257
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,740
 the one whom I am love.

258
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,060
 We are one mind, we are like-minded.

259
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,060
 That's Timothy.

260
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,260
 Timothy was very interesting,

261
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,700
 'cause not only was he a young pastor of a church,

262
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,300
 he was also a second-generation believer,

263
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,100
 probably one of the first.

264
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,540
 His parents, well, actually,

265
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,060
 his mother and his grandmother were of the faith.

266
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,860
 We see this in 2 Timothy, where Paul talks to Timothy

267
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,860
 and says, "Hey, I know you have a very sincere faith,

268
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,860
 "but I first saw it in your grandmother Lois

269
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,420
 "and your mother Eunice."

270
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,060
 And so we see here that he was a second-generation believer.

271
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,380
 Who here is a second-generation believer?

272
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,780
 I am, as in, who here has parents who are believers?

273
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,820
 Okay, not that many of us.

274
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,540
 So he was a second-generation believer, one of the first.

275
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,580
 He was also bicultural,

276
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,100
 bicultural because his father was a Greek

277
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,340
 and his mother was a Jewish Christian.

278
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,180
 So you've got this Timothy, this young man,

279
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,580
 who's very well-spoken, but he's young,

280
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,980
 and he's probably quite timid.

281
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,020
 Paul tells him, "They don't have the spirit of timidity,

282
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,340
 "but of courage, of power."

283
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,780
 So he's probably quite a quiet guy,

284
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,620
 but he's very well-respected.

285
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,740
 And so that's Timothy, and now Paul sends him,

286
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,660
 when he's in his mid-30s, to this church

287
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,380
 in this place called Ephesus.

288
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,980
 So now I want to tell you a little bit about Ephesus

289
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,900
 as I set the scene.

290
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,060
 Ephesus was this major commercial hub.

291
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,420
 Let me tell you a bit more about it.

292
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,460
 It was full of trade.

293
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,100
 The banking was already very established there.

294
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,460
 Lots and lots of trade, lots of money, lots of wealth,

295
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,860
 lots of people, lots of businessmen.

296
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,060
 Constantly, people would be coming through Ephesus.

297
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,580
 And then a lot of the city's trade

298
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,220
 was also influenced by the temple,

299
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,580
 and the temple worshipped the goddess Artemis,

300
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,980
 who was the goddess of fertility.

301
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,020
 So there were some things that I can tell you about Ephesus,

302
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,140
 was this was a city that was ruled by money, sex, and power.

303
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,220
 Money, sex, and power.

304
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,020
 And then these churches started to develop.

305
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,940
 Paul himself stayed in Ephesus for three years

306
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,060
 and looked after this church.

307
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,700
 Now, the churches there, at that time,

308
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,100
 they were still under persecution,

309
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,020
 so they were likely to be house churches.

310
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,420
 So they would gather in people's homes,

311
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,140
 maybe around 20 to 25 people.

312
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,260
 They would gather around

313
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,220
 and just be in their little churches.

314
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,460
 But here was the problem.

315
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,860
 As they were gathering around in these small churches,

316
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,340
 and with all these different people

317
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,420
 coming into this major commercial hub,

318
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,260
 all these businessmen,

319
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,100
 all these people of high social status

320
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,900
 coming into these small churches,

321
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,460
 there was this problem that was arising

322
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,060
 that the teaching was starting to deviate from the truth.

323
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,580
 This trying to deviate from the truth,

324
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,980
 they were starting to question, who was Jesus?

325
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,980
 There were people within the church

326
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,460
 that were starting to teach false doctrine.

327
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,420
 They were starting to teach,

328
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,180
 oh, is Jesus really who he says he is?

329
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,980
 Did the resurrection really happen?

330
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,500
 And so Paul sees this and he's like,

331
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,980
 okay, we need to sort this out.

332
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,060
 So Timothy, can you go to Ephesus and can you stay there?

333
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,380
 And I charge you to do all these things, to be this leader.

334
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,020
 Now, imagine this, and I feel this,

335
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,700
 as a young minister in a city

336
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,500
 ruled by money, sex, and power,

337
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,260
 going into a church that probably had those things

338
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,700
 infiltrated into the church.

339
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,140
 And people who were maybe very used to being listened to,

340
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,140
 who had positions of power in society

341
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,420
 were now coming into the church

342
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,900
 and expecting to be able to talk and to have their way.

343
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,860
 And so this young Timothy comes in,

344
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,460
 needing to confront them, needing to lead the church.

345
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,340
 The integrity of the church was in danger here.

346
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,740
 And so that's really setting the scene.

347
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,740
 That's who Timothy was, and he was writing to Ephesus.

348
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,220
 Of course, you don't need me to tell you

349
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,100
 that actually Ephesus is very similar to where?

350
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:03,940
 Hong Kong.

351
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,380
 And you're asking, okay, so what does this passage

352
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,300
 from 2000 years ago have anything to do

353
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,380
 with what we are living now?

354
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,580
 Well, as you can see, we are in the same place

355
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,580
 where you see the secularisation of church,

356
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,660
 where the way the world runs things outside

357
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,860
 is starting to seep into the church.

358
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,980
 Paganism, the corporate style of running things

359
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,900
 is starting to seep into the body of Christ.

360
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,860
 And yet God asks us the same question, where are you?

361
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,500
 Are you representing me?

362
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,980
 Are you my ambassadors?

363
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,020
 What does the church have to say about caring for the poor?

364
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,060
 What is the church doing as they look after the youth,

365
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,180
 the disenfranchised, the ones who have no hope?

366
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,340
 As we deal with all these things in society,

367
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,100
 where is the church and what are we supposed to do?

368
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,460
 And Paul reminds us here,

369
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,940
 there's only one thing that we really need to think about.

370
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,940
 The aim of our charge is love, love.

371
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,500
 The issues from a pure heart, good conscience

372
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,460
 and sincere faith.

373
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,620
 And you might be here saying, okay, well, fine.

374
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,580
 All you need is love.

375
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,700
 Okay, fine.

376
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,900
 What does that look like?

377
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:18,140
 As we do church together, as we hang out together,

378
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,380
 there's gonna be admin, there's gonna be logistics,

379
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,620
 there's gonna be all these things that we have to do.

380
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,220
 How do we love in the midst of those things?

381
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,660
 And there's really one question I want you to leave

382
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,140
 this call with this evening.

383
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,180
 And that is, where is the love?

384
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,380
 Or maybe to apply it to our lives is,

385
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,100
 what would love have me do?

386
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,660
 What would love, I'm borrowing that from a pastor

387
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,260
 in America called Andy Stanley.

388
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,340
 And it's a question that he would often ask himself

389
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,420
 whenever faced with decisions, whenever faced with needing

390
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,700
 to figure out what to do in a certain circumstance,

391
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,380
 he would ask himself this question,

392
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,980
 what would love have me do?

393
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,660
 That's the question I've been asking myself.

394
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,980
 I'll tell you recently, Christina and I,

395
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,580
 we got into a really big fight, married couples,

396
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,300
 do we get into fights every now and again?

397
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,540
 Yeah, I got into a big fight.

398
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,140
 And I remember that question popping up

399
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,540
 and just piercing through my heart.

400
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,940
 See, when two people are trying to live together

401
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,300
 and raise kids together and work together,

402
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,740
 no doubt there are differences in the way that you do things

403
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,500
 and where you wanna put your toothbrushes

404
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,180
 in a different place with the other person,

405
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,660
 the amount of times you wanna clean the toilet,

406
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,780
 no, this is the whole thing.

407
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,620
 I'm not here to just share all of my household problems

408
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,180
 with you right now.

409
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,140
 But I remember asking myself that question.

410
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,300
 It got to a point where it was like, you know what?

411
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,900
 It wasn't just what's the right thing to do.

412
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,340
 It was what would love have me do.

413
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,900
 And I would love for you to be able

414
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,220
 to leave this room today.

415
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,500
 Having that question in your mind,

416
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,460
 I think everyone here probably has something

417
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,620
 that they have to deal with

418
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,100
 or something that they are dealing with

419
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,900
 or someone that they are dealing with.

420
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,540
 I wanna ask you to think about that question.

421
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,100
 What would love have me do?

422
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:03,340
 Now, again, it's almost an abstract concept sometimes,

423
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,260
 but it can be very much simplified.

424
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,340
 But let's call it an abstract concept for now,

425
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,020
 this idea of love.

426
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,580
 And yet Paul breaks it down.

427
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,060
 Where do you get love from?

428
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,860
 It issues from a pure heart, a good conscience,

429
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,700
 and a sincere faith.

430
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:20,060
 And today I briefly just wanna break those three parts down

431
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,540
 so maybe you can leave here with a better idea

432
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,060
 of what love really is.

433
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,540
 And the first one is a pure heart.

434
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,380
 Love comes from a pure heart.

435
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,900
 Jesus talks about this in Matthew 5:8.

436
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,820
 "Blessed are those who are pure in heart,

437
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,060
 "for they will see God."

438
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,580
 But when we hear that pure in heart,

439
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,060
 we're not talking about someone

440
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,620
 who's fighting successfully the temptations of lust,

441
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,900
 of power, it's not quite just that.

442
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,140
 When he says, "Blessed are those who are pure in heart,"

443
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,700
 what they mean is that you are single-mindedly devoted

444
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,900
 to God.

445
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,060
 He's saying that if you are single-mindedly,

446
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:00,260
 tunnel direction, devoted to God, then you will see Him.

447
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,700
 And your love has to be that from a pure place,

448
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,660
 that we are loving Him wholeheartedly.

449
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,380
 There is no halfway house when it comes to loving God,

450
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,660
 at least there should not be.

451
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,540
 When we love God, it has to be with all our heart,

452
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,020
 soul, and mind.

453
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,100
 It has to be wholehearted.

454
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,100
 The totality of your affections has to be directed to God.

455
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,420
 Let me just stop there.

456
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,540
 No need to raise hands, but hey,

457
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,340
 how many of us declare that we love God?

458
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,460
 We sing songs and we,

459
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,940
 but do we really, truly love Him?

460
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,540
 With a pure heart, single-mindedly devoted to Him?

461
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,380
 When we sing the songs in church,

462
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,300
 do we truly mean them?

463
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,980
 Are we giving up ourselves completely to the Lord?

464
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,340
 And I think sometimes, and for those of us

465
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,780
 who have maybe spent so much time in church,

466
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,300
 we can go through the motions so easily.

467
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,300
 Just declare our love, but is it really a love

468
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,420
 that comes out of a pure heart?

469
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,500
 Jesus talks about this.

470
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,700
 He says, "They might be worshipping me with their lips,

471
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,940
 "but their hearts are far from me.

472
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,180
 "They may look good on the outside,

473
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,060
 "but inside, oh my goodness, they are so filthy.

474
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,420
 "They are so distanced from me."

475
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,420
 Brothers and sisters, do you have a pure heart for God?

476
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:32,900
 When you say you love Him, when you sing about loving Him,

477
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,060
 do you truly love Him?

478
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,780
 Have you given Him everything?

479
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,900
 That's the first thing.

480
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,820
 Love comes from a pure heart.

481
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,780
 The second one is this, a good conscience.

482
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,740
 A good conscience, the word conscience there in the Greek

483
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,540
 is synedesis, which means joint knowledge.

484
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,820
 It means having an awareness of right and wrong.

485
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,500
 And this was happening in the church at that moment,

486
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,660
 where we'll talk about it in the coming weeks,

487
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,020
 especially when it deals with false doctrine,

488
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,060
 Paul was saying that there are certain people in the church,

489
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,540
 in the church, not outside, in the church,

490
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,820
 who are teaching a false gospel.

491
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,340
 And what does he say in 1 Timothy 3, 4?

492
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,540
 He says, "Their consciences are seared.

493
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,540
 "They are liars.

494
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,700
 "They are liars."

495
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,380
 And when he talks about a leader in 1 Timothy 3,

496
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,100
 he's talking about a leader that needs to hold

497
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,900
 the mystery of the faith in good conscience,

498
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,060
 having full awareness of what's right and wrong.

499
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,140
 See, there were people in the church at that moment

500
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,660
 that were teaching, and they were basically teaching

501
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,540
 false truth, basically to control other people.

502
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,060
 Some of the things, and Paul talks about this in Timothy,

503
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,860
 he's saying, "Some of you are forbidding people

504
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,700
 "to get married.

505
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,220
 "Some of you are banning marriage.

506
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,820
 "Some of you are banning foods.

507
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,380
 "You're doing that because you are seeking control.

508
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,900
 "Your consciences are seared.

509
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,540
 "You are liars.

510
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,740
 "You don't have this conscience where you know

511
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,300
 "what's right from wrong anymore."

512
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,460
 You may stop there and just go,

513
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,300
 "Well, hang on a minute.

514
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,300
 "Conscience is a very individualistic thing.

515
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,940
 "Hey, what's right for me is right.

516
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:19,860
 "We're in that kind of society now, right?"

517
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,660
 But you see, that's our own,

518
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,580
 maybe a lot of us might be influenced

519
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,380
 by the modern way of thinking,

520
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,500
 maybe a Western way of thinking,

521
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,140
 which is our conscience belongs to us,

522
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,620
 that everything is just, only God can judge me.

523
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,460
 You can't judge me.

524
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,900
 Everything is about, everything can be determined by me.

525
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,180
 But you see, Paul wouldn't have written

526
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,780
 about conscience in such a way.

527
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,980
 The Eastern mindset, and maybe for those of us

528
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,540
 who are more Chinese will understand this,

529
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,660
 when it comes to good conscience,

530
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,220
 when it comes to right and wrong,

531
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,220
 it is also found within the context of community.

532
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,020
 It is also found in the context of community,

533
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,940
 believers together, interpreting scripture together,

534
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,660
 not just relying on the flesh of one person

535
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,700
 and then distorting it for their own good.

536
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,540
 But within a community,

537
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,220
 you determine what is right and wrong.

538
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,780
 That is how you have a good conscience

539
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,420
 because it affects, recognizing that what you do

540
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,820
 affects other people.

541
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,140
 Maybe the Western mindset is one of guilt.

542
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,700
 When you do something wrong, I feel guilty

543
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,740
 'cause I've wronged and it's all about me.

544
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,500
 But the Eastern mindset is different.

545
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,660
 It's about honour.

546
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,500
 It's about shame.

547
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,660
 When you do something wrong,

548
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,980
 yeah, you probably feel guilty,

549
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,460
 but you feel that shame,

550
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,100
 that I have brought shame on my whole family.

551
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,100
 I can't do that because it will be frowned upon

552
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,140
 in my community.

553
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,580
 And that's more of what the Apostle Paul

554
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,860
 would have understood it to be.

555
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,140
 So for us, it's important for us to gather in these places

556
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,500
 and to teach each other correct doctrine

557
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,060
 because it's here where we're able to live out the truth.

558
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,780
 It's here where we're able to maintain that good conscience,

559
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,340
 that awareness of what's right and wrong.

560
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,300
 So the question that we have to ask is,

561
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,180
 as we go about our way, as we make decisions,

562
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,980
 is our conscience clear?

563
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,300
 Are we glorifying God?

564
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,820
 And are we edifying and lifting up the body

565
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,900
 and building up the body of Christ?

566
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,020
 That's how you know you have a good conscience.

567
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,020
 And only then will you have the love that God demands.

568
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,980
 Conscience is tied in with love

569
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,220
 because it's about how we love each other,

570
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,380
 if we're just all determined by how we feel

571
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,860
 and we're not caring about other people,

572
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,180
 then is that really love?

573
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:39,180
 But true love is where we consider the interests of others.

574
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:44,300
 That's how we maintain our good conscience.

575
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,020
 And the final thing is sincere faith.

576
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,740
 Paul talks about this,

577
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,220
 that some people have shipwrecked their faith.

578
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,300
 This sincere faith is one that is without pretense

579
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,340
 or without deceit.

580
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,300
 It is sincere, it is genuine.

581
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,220
 2 Timothy 1, he says,

582
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,860
 "Hey, there's this sincere faith that I see in you, Timothy,

583
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,260
 "and it's great, young man,

584
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,500
 "but I didn't see it in you first.

585
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,940
 "I saw it in your grandmother, Lois,

586
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,820
 "and I saw it in your mother, Eunice,

587
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,220
 "and it's great and it's beautiful."

588
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,100
 But here's the thing about faith.

589
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,980
 For those of you who may be a second generation believers,

590
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,460
 even though it's passed down to you,

591
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,500
 you still have to be the one that embraces it yourself.

592
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,940
 It's only genuine when it's your own.

593
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,660
 You can't rely on your parents' faith.

594
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,100
 You can't rely on the faith of the friends around you.

595
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,420
 You cannot rely on your pastor's faith.

596
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,660
 Your faith has to be a sincere one

597
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,620
 that is genuinely your own.

598
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,020
 One of my favourite songs is "Help Me Find My Own Flame."

599
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,540
 'Cause I grew up, and my brother grew up in a church

600
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,340
 where our parents were very well-respected within the church,

601
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,340
 and everyone would look at us

602
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,340
 and just see us as being the good kids growing up in church.

603
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,540
 But at some point, both of us had to decide

604
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:04,220
 that this faith, are we sincere about this faith?

605
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,580
 Is it a genuine faith?

606
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,620
 Is it an authentic one?

607
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,980
 Do I truly believe in God?

608
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,020
 Do I truly love Him with all my heart, soul, and mind?

609
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,300
 Do I truly believe what the Bible says?

610
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,500
 Not just because my parents tell me to believe.

611
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,060
 Not just because it's something that I've done all my life,

612
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,820
 going to church.

613
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,540
 But do I truly believe that what happened in this book

614
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,500
 from Genesis to Revelation,

615
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,740
 do I truly believe that it existed?

616
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,700
 Do I truly believe that Jesus existed?

617
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,780
 That He really is who He says He is?

618
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:44,780
 Do I truly believe that He died and rose from the dead?

619
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,860
 That song that we sang, that it was finished on the cross.

620
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,180
 Do I truly believe in the power of the cross?

621
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,220
 Not do they believe,

622
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,020
 not do I know intellectually that it happened,

623
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,620
 but do I truly believe it in my heart?

624
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:07,620
 Because when you do, you complete this trio

625
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,260
 that contributes to love.

626
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:16,260
 When you have sincere faith added to a good conscience,

627
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,100
 added to a pure heart,

628
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,820
 you finally get the kind of love

629
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,420
 that Paul is charging Timothy with,

630
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,820
 that Jesus is commanding us to have.

631
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,100
 That kind of love.

632
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,700
 And you might ask this question to me,

633
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,980
 I'm asking it all the time.

634
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,340
 What would love have me do?

635
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:40,700
 How do I live the most lovingly in this circumstance,

636
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,940
 in this scenario at work, in this challenge in my family?

637
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,580
 How do I love?

638
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,820
 I struggle with love, with loving people.

639
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,740
 I struggle with loving my kids, with loving my wife,

640
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,780
 with loving my mother,

641
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,140
 and definitely struggle with loving my brother.

642
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:05,620
 Love, do you struggle with love?

643
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,460
 See, the thing about love is this,

644
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,180
 and this is where I'll finish.

645
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,060
 Jesus commands us to love God and love people.

646
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,420
 And he ties the two together.

647
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,860
 You can't love God, but not love people.

648
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,940
 You have to love God.

649
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,620
 And when you, sorry, when you love God,

650
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,580
 you have to love people, because that's his heart.

651
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,740
 So you genuinely have to do it.

652
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,700
 And when you love people,

653
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,260
 that is simply an overflow of your love for God.

654
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,380
 So maybe I'll finish with this question.

655
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,220
 For those of you who are struggling to love others,

656
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,740
 or maybe you're struggling to live out that kind of love,

657
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,860
 'cause it's hard, and it is,

658
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,700
 and the best things are never easy.

659
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,940
 But as you think about why is it so hard to love,

660
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,340
 I guess the first real question is,

661
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,660
 do you know what love is?

662
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:03,580
 And the greatest form of love

663
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,860
 is when Jesus gave his life for you.

664
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,700
 Do you truly believe that in your head

665
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,940
 and let it drop down into your heart?

666
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:17,420
 You only really appreciate Jesus' love for you

667
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,260
 if you really are aware that you needed saving.

668
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,860
 Because if you're not aware

669
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,700
 that actually that you need rescuing,

670
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,180
 then you're not really that grateful

671
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,540
 when your rescuer comes.

672
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,420
 So then it goes back and we rewind it back.

673
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,580
 Do you, are you aware of your own depravity?

674
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,460
 Are you aware that you fall short of the glory of God?

675
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,860
 You are so far, far worse than you ever dared even think.

676
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,700
 When you get to that point,

677
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,580
 when you realise how broken you are,

678
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,380
 that you on your own cannot do this,

679
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,620
 when you realise that,

680
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,300
 when you realise that without God,

681
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,300
 you are literally drowning underwater,

682
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,260
 then you will truly understand the love

683
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,100
 that God has for you,

684
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,900
 that he was willing to empty himself.

685
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,180
 He was willing to come down from heaven to earth

686
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,460
 to come and rescue you.

687
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,260
 So only when you truly understand how far short you fall,

688
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,620
 do you truly understand,

689
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,700
 do you truly embrace and appreciate how much you are loved.

690
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,980
 And once you appreciate how much you are loved,

691
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,740
 that God would rescue you,

692
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,500
 that God will rescue me,

693
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,380
 that will then fill your heart with the kind of love

694
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,940
 that will allow you to love other people.

695
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,980
 And so church, brothers and sisters,

696
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,420
 as we go about our way in life in this city

697
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,860
 that is very similar to Ephesus,

698
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,020
 as we meet people who are clearly struggling

699
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,260
 on loving each other,

700
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,940
 can we ask that question?

701
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,100
 Where is the love?

702
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,940
 Oh, that love is supposed to be in me.

703
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,300
 So I am going to live out that love.

704
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,900
 What would love have me do?

705
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,020
 That is the question of the day.

706
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,180
 What would love have us do as a church?

707
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,100
 And we're gonna be going into some very interesting topics

708
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,220
 in these next few months

709
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,860
 about how the church should handle

710
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,020
 a lot of different matters.

711
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,340
 But I never want us to stray too far

712
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,100
 from just focusing on those issues

713
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,260
 'cause Paul has said it here.

714
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,780
 The whole point of all those charges,

715
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,260
 the whole point of all those commandments is love.

716
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,340
 And we start there.

717
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,260
 That is the priority.

718
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,660
 When the world is asking us,

719
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,500
 where are you, church?

720
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,340
 What are you doing?

721
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,700
 About this, about this, about this, about this.

722
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,700
 We stick to what we need to remember, which is love.

723
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,140
 That's the priority.

724
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,580
 Did you know the word priority

725
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,140
 appeared in the English language

726
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,620
 about in the 14th century?

727
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,500
 And it only ever used to be singular, priority.

728
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,180
 Because you're only really supposed

729
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,300
 to only have one priority.

730
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,580
 But it was only in the 19th century

731
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,740
 where the English language started to evolve

732
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,660
 and it became priorities.

733
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:59,780
 And then suddenly we have all these other things

734
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,220
 that are vying for our attention.

735
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,220
 Oh, I should do this, I should do this, I should do this.

736
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,580
 Love is the priority.

737
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,060
 That should be the thing that fills our hearts.

738
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,340
 That should be the thing that determines

739
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,820
 everything that we do.

740
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,340
 Love.

741
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,980
 All you need is love.

742
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,700
 Let's pray.

743
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:27,220
 So Father, as we,

744
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:33,020
 as we come before you and we thank you for your word,

745
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,820
 that you use Paul to write to Timothy.

746
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:41,260
 And we pray that those charges

747
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:47,140
 would seep into our own life, our own church.

748
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,300
 Lord, that we would remember,

749
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,620
 that we would cling on to love.

750
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,020
 That you would remind us of what love really is.

751
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:03,380
 Lord, that you would reveal to us,

752
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,780
 for those of us who are struggling with the pure heart,

753
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,580
 that our hearts are just so distracted,

754
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,220
 that we are loving so many different things.

755
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,740
 I pray, Lord, that you would just give us the strength

756
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,740
 to be able to just love you with everything that we have.

757
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,540
 If all that we are,

758
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:28,540
 would you give us the strength to be able to love you

759
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,140
 with a pure heart, to search our hearts, test our thoughts,

760
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,500
 see if there's any offensive way in us

761
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,740
 and lead us on the path that is everlasting.

762
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:41,940
 I pray that you would grant us your spirit

763
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,220
 to help us discern and grant us a good conscience.

764
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,260
 One that would bring you honour,

765
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,220
 the one that would honour those around us.

766
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,260
 For those of us who have maybe deviated from the truth.

767
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,260
 Lord, that you would bring us back to your truth.

768
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,260
 To your love.

769
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,060
 And finally, Lord, we bow down before you

770
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:11,060
 and we come before you with a sincere faith.

771
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:17,260
 Recognising that we are far worse than we ever imagined,

772
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,060
 we're far more loved than we ever dared dream.

773
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,260
 We come before you with a broken heart,

774
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,860
 a contrite spirit.

775
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,460
 Recognising our need for you.

776
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,260
 For you.

777
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:33,660
 Our need for you, not their need for you,

778
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,060
 but our need for you.

779
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:41,060
 And we pray, Lord, that you would show us the way.

780
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,660
 That you would show us your heart.

781
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:51,460
 So we rest in your presence and we build our lives

782
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,660
 on that firm foundation that is love.

783
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,660
 May it not just be an abstract concept.

784
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:04,460
 May it not just be the words in a cheesy romantic song.

785
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:10,060
 May it be the kind of love that you showed us.

786
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:16,660
 And may we be given opportunities to ask that question.

787
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,460
 What would love have us do?

788
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:23,660
 Thank you, Lord.

789
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,860
 It's in your name we pray.

790
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,660
 Amen.

791
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,660

792
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,660
