[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.960]   - Excited to be back here, to be able to share with you.
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.360]   I'll give you one minute on the family gathering
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.560]   that we're doing, that we're starting tomorrow,
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.080]   and really praying that the Lord would use it.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.480]   It started really with Christina and I,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.760]   and then with Joe and his dear wife Alex,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.160]   who have become parents as well three weeks ago,
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.660]   really asking ourselves, how do we disciple our children?
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.660]   How do we disciple our family?
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.380]   And how do we disciple not just our biological children,
[00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.060]   but also our spiritual children?
[00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.720]   How do we live as a family together,
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.720]   that's devoted to one another,
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.840]   to actually walking with one another?
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.280]   And so that's why we're doing this,
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.820]   and it's a family gathering, of course,
[00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.860]   it's child-friendly, but it's not exclusive
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.640]   to just people with children either.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.200]   But rather it's, how do we explore,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.900]   how do we invest in what it means to be children of God,
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.940]   to be a family together?
[00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.560]   To not just do church on a, just do 90 minutes,
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.160]   one day a week, but to do more than that.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.200]   What does that actually mean?
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.700]   So that's what the family gathering's about.
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.260]   Feel free to come and ask us any questions.
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.120]   So we've been in the UK for this long time,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.920]   and I forgot how hot it is outside in Hong Kong.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.520]   I also forgot how cold it is inside as well,
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.760]   with all the air con.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.560]   So those two things were really quite a shock to us.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.480]   And there's one question that I always dreaded
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.380]   when we got back to Hong Kong.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.920]   Those of you who visit home will probably hear it a lot,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.980]   especially these last few months,
[00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.280]   or sorry, these last few years.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.960]   The question we got all the way was,
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.160]   hey, how's Hong Kong?
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.840]   Right?
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.720]   And then you're like, I don't even know where to start.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.880]   I haven't seen you for three years,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.940]   I haven't been outside of Hong Kong for three years.
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.760]   I don't even know how to appropriately describe to you
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.520]   how's Hong Kong, right?
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.840]   Just seen so much.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.000]   In 2003, we were in England when SARS happened.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.120]   2014, we were in England when Occupy Central happened.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.840]   Who would have known that in the short three years
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   we had there, we would have both of those events,
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.120]   but enlarged on steroids during our time here.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.720]   And we've just had so many different things
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.540]   that we've had to work around our head.
[00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.960]   Just all the events that have happened,
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.200]   and then it's just not even Hong Kong anymore.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.160]   It's the world, right?
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.400]   You look at the news,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.920]   you look on the other side of the world,
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.120]   and you look, man, how's the world?
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.600]   It's hard.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.280]   And as a believer, it's particularly hard,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.920]   because we have all these tensions
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.840]   that we have to hold, don't we?
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.400]   We have all these paradoxical tensions
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.440]   that we have to hold.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.760]   At the beginning of the year,
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.060]   our family and I, we were like, you know what?
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.660]   It doesn't really matter what's happening outside.
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.820]   The one thing that matters the most
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.680]   is how we are on the inside,
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.460]   how thankful we are on the inside.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.680]   So every night, our family and I, the four of us,
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.960]   we went to Muji, we bought a book each,
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.060]   and we would do our gratitude book.
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.480]   And every day we would think of one thing
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.520]   to be thankful for, and we would write it down.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.000]   Because it's so hard.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.440]   As a believer, how do you make sense of this world,
[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.520]   still be grateful, still be filled with gratitude,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.400]   but also still acknowledge that you're grieving,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.200]   that you've lost things, you've lost freedom,
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.600]   you've lost time with family,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.160]   you've lost things that you wanted to do,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.000]   you've lost your career, whatever it might be.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.640]   So you have grief, and you have gratitude.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.080]   How do you hold those things together
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.600]   as you see this world seemingly tear itself apart
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.240]   or just falling apart at the seams?
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.960]   And then we have to rejoice, even in suffering.
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.160]   When things are not going well,
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.720]   when things are not going the way we want,
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.120]   yet somehow this book tells us,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.880]   and if this book is to be believed,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.600]   this book keeps telling us you must rejoice.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.680]   Rejoice in the Lord.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.960]   Again, I will say, rejoice.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.000]   How do you rejoice?
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.360]   Through suffering.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.640]   How do you turn sorrow into joy?
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.160]   These are the paradoxical tensions
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.640]   that we as believers have to face, right?
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.400]   These are the things that we deal with every day,
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.440]   and I'm sure that you deal with them too.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.680]   One thing that I've realized going back to England
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.080]   and seeing my old friends and the simple life that is there,
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.080]   I realized that for me,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.200]   life has stopped being black and white.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.840]   I think as you age, as you gain in wisdom,
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.240]   suddenly it's, oh, things are not so black and white anymore.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.120]   There's much more of a gray area that we're dealing with.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.560]   And so then really the question is, what then?
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.640]   As we're stuck in this world, in this city, with this world,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.360]   how do we as believers act?
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.480]   What is it that we should do?
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.400]   You guys have been going through
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.200]   this book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.880]   Admittedly, I think Gabriel said this too,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.520]   is it's a complicated book, not one of my favorites.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.040]   It's confusing.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.880]   There's so many layers to it,
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.320]   and it's just, he's talking about different things
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.520]   and going from different places.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.280]   Of course, it's part of this genre called Hebrew wisdom.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.240]   And the kehelet, this preacher,
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.760]   Ecclesiastes, Ecclesia is this gathering.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.680]   So this is a gathering of wisdom almost that he does.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.520]   As he gathers his wisdom, he then starts sharing it.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.000]   And the first half of the book
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.600]   that you guys have just been through
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.440]   has been him basically making observations.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.600]   He's treating it as like a scientific experiment
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.880]   as he looks at the world and he's seeing all these things.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.240]   And he's making all these observations
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.440]   in this first half of the book
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.080]   up until the end of chapter six.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.120]   And then in the second half, he starts dropping dimes.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.120]   He starts dropping wisdom on how to deal
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.880]   with the observations that he just made.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.600]   Chapter six, at the end, he asked this question.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.480]   It's not on the slides there.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.040]   It says, "For who knows what is good for man
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.320]   "while he lives the few days of his vain life,
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.920]   "which he passes like a shadow?"
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.240]   For who knows what is good for man?
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.600]   He's basically asking the same question I just said.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.720]   As we live in this world, as we see all these things,
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.720]   so what?
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.120]   So what?
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.480]   What does that mean for us?
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.880]   How should we live?
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.280]   What is a good way for us to live?
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.480]   And as we look at chapter seven,
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.240]   the title is "How to be Better Off."
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.880]   As we look at chapter seven, I think he tackles this
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.480]   as he drops these nuggets of wisdom.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.320]   What he actually does,
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.560]   he's actually trying to tune our attitude.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.240]   He's trying to tune our approach
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.520]   and our perspective to life.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.600]   And hopefully, as we tune our perspective to life,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.800]   we will know how to deal with life.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.640]   So that's what he's doing.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.600]   He's targeting, he's attacking our perspective,
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.720]   our approach on things.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.280]   And the first thing he does is he attacks
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.160]   or he tunes our perspective on two things,
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.440]   life and death.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.280]   Life and death.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.520]   Let me show you the verses.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.680]   A good name, chapter seven, verse one.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.080]   A good name is better than precious ointment
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.440]   and the day of death than the day of birth.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.600]   It is better to go to the house of mourning
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.560]   than to go to the house of feasting.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.080]   For this is the end of all mankind
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.440]   and the living will lay it to heart.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.760]   Sorrow is better than laughter
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.840]   for by sadness of face, the heart is made glad.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.120]   The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.080]   but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.440]   He's saying it's better to be at a funeral
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.480]   than to see the birth of a baby.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.520]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.360]   'Cause no one would say,
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.160]   "Oh, I'd love to go to a funeral this week."
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.520]   No one would like to say that.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.920]   He's tackling life by talking about death.
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.680]   And death is a topic that none of us
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.680]   really like to talk about.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.720]   Chinese culture especially, and I've talked about this,
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.480]   we despise, we're terrified of death, right?
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.280]   Everything that we do is geared towards avoiding death.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.680]   And every way we describe something,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.880]   something to its extreme,
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.720]   we're always talking about death.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.840]   And I've said this before,
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.840]   Everything is safe.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.680]   Because there's something about death
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.280]   that we don't know what to do with,
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.640]   because we need to control.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.600]   We need to control,
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.760]   but yet we don't know how to control death.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.800]   We don't know what to do with it.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.360]   Let me tell you about two kings.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.240]   One of the kings is a guy called Louis XVI in France.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.240]   He also did not like death.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.280]   And he actually forbid people
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.480]   from mentioning the word death in his presence.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.640]   So you were not allowed to.
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.680]   You'd have to just work around it,
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.040]   or just avoid the topic altogether.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.000]   He didn't like it.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.760]   There's another king called Philip II of Macedon.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.240]   Macedon is the ancient kingdom of Macedonia.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.480]   He had the opposite approach.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.400]   He wanted to be reminded of death every day.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.720]   He hired a servant to tell him every day at daybreak,
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.440]   "Philip, one day you will die."
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.040]   That was the job.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.080]   Imagine being that servant.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.440]   What a great job.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.080]   You clock in at 7 a.m., you finish at 7.01,
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.120]   and then you have the rest of the day.
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.720]   "Philip, one day you will die."
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.520]   Reminds me of my daughter, actually.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.000]   My daughter, who's growing in age and observational skills,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.480]   she looks at me practically every day now, right?
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.840]   And she says, "Daddy, you're getting old.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.200]   "You don't have any hair."
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   Like, practically every day, she'll remind me of that, right?
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.440]   And so Philip II had this servant remind him,
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.560]   "Philip, one day you will die,"
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.760]   to remind him of his mortality,
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.240]   to remind him that life isn't all there is,
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.880]   that there is more to that.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.800]   Alan Iverson, one of my favorite basketball players,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.320]   would say, "I play every game as though it's my last."
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.920]   And so he had this mindset that,
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.960]   "Who knows what will happen?"
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.360]   And just to go back to Philip II of Macedon,
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.880]   this mindset of being reminded every day,
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.800]   "Philip, one day you will die,"
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.920]   his child was then Alexander the Great.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.920]   And it's interesting, isn't it?
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.080]   Because death is an interesting thing.
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.240]   And I can say I've had an interesting relationship
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.040]   with death myself.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.160]   Growing up, I was also afraid of death.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.240]   In fact, there was one point,
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.560]   I've shared this story before maybe to some of you,
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.080]   as a teenager who was trying to figure out life
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.040]   and living completely in the present,
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.360]   my dad dragged me aside one day and said,
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   "James, I have this feeling that one day I will die early.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.240]   "The Lord will take me to heaven early."
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.320]   And he made me promise him to be true to my calling always.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.520]   And from that day on, I was always thinking about death.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.360]   I remember, so I used to work in McDonald's when I was 16,
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.480]   I remember him driving me to McDonald's,
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.720]   he was dropping me off there to go to my shift,
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.040]   and then he was actually doing a work trip,
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.040]   so he had to go.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.720]   And in that moment, as I got out of the car
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.680]   and said goodbye to him, I was like,
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.960]   "Oh, this could be the last time I see my dad."
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.360]   Always, have you had that?
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.720]   Do you know when you say goodbye to someone
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.640]   and you're like, "Oh, this may be the last time."
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.960]   I don't know, maybe when you get older and older,
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.040]   maybe that becomes more and more common.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.240]   But I had that feeling.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.920]   And then what is in just that work trip,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.720]   it was, "Oh, they're not home yet.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.960]   "I'm just gonna sit outside
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.360]   "and just wait to see if they're back yet."
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.520]   And I had this relationship.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.120]   And every time my mind was blank and not thinking anything,
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.520]   the word death would pop into my mind.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.120]   It would just always be there.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.400]   And I was terrified of it.
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.640]   One year later, he actually did die.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.200]   After a trip to Hong Kong, we went back to England
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.720]   and had dinner, and then just at the dinner table,
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.760]   just whilst eating, he fell off and that was it.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.600]   He was gone.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.080]   And I'll tell you, that did one thing for me.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.080]   It actually freed me, almost, from that fear of death.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.600]   'Cause it's happened now.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   Do you know when your worst fear has happened?
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.040]   We spent three years avoiding COVID,
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.080]   we go to England.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.360]   And then we caught it.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.240]   I caught it, I went to a work trip to New York,
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.520]   so I caught the latest strain, the US strain.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.880]   Well, got back to home, oh, caught COVID.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.800]   I remember Paul telling me when he caught COVID
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.560]   that he had the worst sore throat he'd ever had.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.320]   And I was like, "You're just weak."
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.160]   And then,
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.560]   and then I had it,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.200]   and then it was just the worst sore throat I've ever had.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.400]   I mean, I've always known that genetically,
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.800]   Paul and I are very similar.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.280]   But for me, it was like, "Oh, we've had it, we've had it."
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.080]   And then suddenly you're not as scared.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.840]   Suddenly it's like, "Oh, I've had it already."
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.840]   Death is an interesting one.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.920]   So I wanna ask you, what's your relationship with death?
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.640]   'Cause he says here, "It is better to be at the day of death
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.680]   "than at the day of a birth."
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.960]   What does that mean?
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.000]   That means, are you prepared?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.560]   Are you acceptant?
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.600]   Are you embracing the fact that you will die?
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.960]   For older people, maybe you're better at this.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.880]   For younger people, you live as though you won't ever die.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.560]   Can I share something with you
[00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:46.600]   that's really sad and really morbid?
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.160]   Every single person in this room will die.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:57.000]   The person you're sat next to right now will die.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.760]   How much do we think about that?
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.520]   But it's only when you think about that
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.800]   do you then get a better perspective on life.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.240]   Because we've watched the movies where,
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.560]   actually, Chinese, again, shows you about death.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.680]   All these TVB legend series are all about
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:21.240]   finding that medicine, the (speaks in foreign language)
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.320]   Am I right?
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.040]   And then I can live forever.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.640]   And then we've watched the movies
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.120]   of the people who do live forever
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.320]   because they're immortals in some way
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.480]   or vampires in some way,
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.720]   and they're pretty, pretty grumpy.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.800]   They're not happy at all.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.000]   Just because you live forever
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.240]   doesn't mean you'll live a happy life.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.120]   In fact, it's death.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.080]   That's that expiry date that gives your life meaning,
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.680]   that suddenly makes the days that you have valuable.
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:52.320]   How in tune with you, are you, with your own mortality?
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.720]   That you know that one day you will die.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.840]   You only get that when you go to a funeral.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.600]   When you meet a young baby,
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.000]   you forget about it altogether.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.480]   But one day, all of us will die.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.560]   The Psalmist in 90 says, "Teach me to number my days."
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.440]   The Apostle Paul says, "To live is Christ, to die is gain."
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.040]   To get to that point where you're like,
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.080]   you know what, our amount of life on Earth,
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.840]   whether it's 10 years, 20 years, 90 years,
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.520]   100 years, 120 years,
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.480]   I think the latest oldest man in the world
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.560]   is 128 or something.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.880]   All of that is still here.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.680]   And then the rest of eternity is all of this.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:35.920]   We've heard the two most important days in your existence
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.000]   are today and that day.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.800]   Today, living in the present right now,
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.680]   and that day, the moment you meet your creator,
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.440]   the moment you walk through death's door
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.920]   and you realise that it's not all the end,
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.840]   in fact, it's only just the beginning.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.440]   And that's why Paul can say,
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.480]   "To live is Christ, to die is gain."
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.680]   My desire is to depart and be with Christ,
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.840]   for that is far better.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.920]   Because he had the right perspective on life and death.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.160]   What about you?
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.680]   Do you live as though today is your last?
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.880]   Now, you can't really live as though today is your last,
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.520]   practically speaking.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.760]   That cannot happen, right?
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.600]   Because if you did, then you wouldn't go to work,
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.000]   you wouldn't do your laundry,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.320]   you wouldn't pay your taxes,
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.600]   and then you'd be in trouble the next day
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.440]   when you wake up and you're like,
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.960]   "Oh man, this is not my last day.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.360]   "I'm in trouble now."
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.440]   So practically speaking,
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.240]   you can't live as though every day is your last,
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.560]   but can you live as though eternity is real?
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.920]   Can you live with eternity in mind?
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.840]   That actually, everything that I do today
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.160]   has earthly significance,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.840]   but also has eternal significance.
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.560]   That every decision I make,
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.240]   whether it is to do the laundry,
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.400]   has an eternal significance.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.720]   How I approach life,
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.120]   my perspective towards life and death is so important.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.760]   And so we can be heavenly minded and earthly good.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.080]   So that's the first thing he tackles.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.360]   This perspective on life and death.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.640]   What is your relationship with life and death?
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.320]   The second one is, he has an attack on our perspective
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.280]   on prosperity and adversity.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.800]   And I'm gonna skip a few verses here
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.880]   'cause we won't have time to go through all of them.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.880]   Verse 14 says this.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.000]   In the day of prosperity, be joyful,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.200]   and in the day of adversity, consider.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.040]   God has made the one as well as the other,
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   so that man may not find out anything
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.520]   that will be after him.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.920]   In my vain life, I have seen everything.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.600]   There's a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.440]   Oops, sorry.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.200]   A man can't multitask, sorry.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.920]   In my vain life, I have seen everything.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.000]   There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.160]   and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.080]   in his evil do.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.800]   So there's no guarantee.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.560]   But somehow, some of us treat the faith like that, right?
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.160]   If I read my Bible, if I wake up, if I pray,
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.960]   if I go to church, then I'm a good person,
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.880]   and then blessings will come upon me.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.400]   Then I will live a good life.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.240]   God is for me, not against me,
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.680]   so therefore he will help me find a parking space today.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:58.440]   And everything will be good today.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.360]   And my wedding day will be sunny
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.680]   because I'm a righteous person, right?
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.520]   But yet, Scripture says very, very clearly,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.760]   Kohelet observes that's not true.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:15.480]   Matthew 5.45 says,
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.800]   "It rains on the righteous and the unrighteous."
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.040]   We're all subject to the humidity here in Hong Kong,
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.360]   whether you're righteous or not.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.680]   The sun shines on the righteous or the unrighteous.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.440]   It doesn't make a difference
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.280]   because the Christian faith, the perspective,
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.000]   isn't about whether you get a good life or not
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.240]   because that's this bit here.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.320]   The Christian life is this, the whole of this.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.120]   And it's a different thing
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.440]   because when you remember that,
[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.160]   then it changes the way you approach
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.520]   prosperity and adversity.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.040]   It's important because Kohelet here is saying,
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.240]   have a level-headed approach to life.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.600]   Peter says, "Be sober."
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.440]   What does that mean?
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.760]   Don't get so drunk and high on the things of life
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.080]   and also don't drown your sorrows
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.600]   when things are not good.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.080]   Have a level-headed approach to things.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.720]   My dear brother and Alex, they recently had their baby
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.720]   and of course, every parent of newborns will know
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.000]   how tiring it is, how much of a rollercoaster it is,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.040]   how much you realize
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.520]   that you are completely out of your control.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.360]   I remember our two kids
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.440]   and you know the one thing I learned when we had our two
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.560]   was that there will be good days when you sleep,
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.400]   when my wife sleeps, gets to sleep five hours in a row
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.240]   without being interrupted.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.240]   There will be good days but they will never last
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.040]   because in a few days' time, there will be bad days
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.920]   because there's a growth spurt, there's teething,
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.720]   there's colic, there's all these other things
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.960]   and there will be bad days.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.160]   And then on the bad days, I remind myself,
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.600]   the bad days will also never last.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.840]   Parenting life is just like this.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.200]   There's good days and there's bad days.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.760]   As a believer, how do we approach that?
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.800]   Every time something bad happens,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.920]   we're like, "God, why me?
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.200]   "Why did I not get that job?"
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.040]   Right?
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.640]   "Why is it raining today?"
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.720]   Can you imagine?
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.840]   God's like, "No, I never promised that.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.280]   "In fact, I told you the opposite.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.200]   "I said, in this world, you will have trouble."
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.400]   Romans 5, it says, "It's suffering that is gonna be
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.080]   "the thing that brings out endurance
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.880]   "and then brings out character and then brings out hope."
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.600]   James 1, "It's counted all joy when you meet trials
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.760]   "of various kinds because it's that testing of your faith
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.680]   "that will make you steadfast, it will make you perfect
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.080]   "and lacking in nothing."
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.480]   I told you, I am your shepherd.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.000]   You shall not want.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.520]   I'll lead you beside still waters, green pastures.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.400]   I will lead you in the right path.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.920]   That's verse three.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.600]   And then he says, "Even though I walk through the valley
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.600]   "of the shadow of death."
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:59.240]   Wait a minute, you just said you would lead me
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.200]   in the paths of righteousness for your namesake.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.160]   And then the next verse,
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.760]   "I'm walking in the valley of the shadow of death."
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.600]   What?
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.280]   But that's what the shepherd said.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.960]   I will lead you on the right path
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.160]   and the right path is the hard path.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.160]   Adversity.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.680]   How do you approach adversity?
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.840]   Are you shocked, devastated
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:31.800]   when you realise not every good thing is happening to me?
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.080]   Kohelet here is saying, "Hey, have a different perspective
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.840]   "on adversity and prosperity."
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.480]   One of my favourite, Allen Iverson is a good player
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.320]   that I really liked.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.520]   Steph Curry is one of my absolute favourites.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.680]   And on his shoes with his Under Armour deal,
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.920]   he puts Philippines 413.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.600]   "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.960]   What a great passage, "I can do all things,
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.440]   "all my dreams, my American dream,
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.280]   "the house in the suburbs, the wife, the life,
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.920]   "the kids, the job, the money.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.160]   "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.120]   That is not what that passage is about.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.720]   Because if you just rewind just a few verses,
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.360]   he's saying, "Not that I'm speaking of being in need,
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.160]   "for I've learned that in whatever situation
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   "I am to be content.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.080]   "I know how to be brought low, I know how to abound.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.520]   "In any and every circumstance, I've learned the secret
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   "of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.240]   "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.600]   That's the context of it.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.280]   That's the perspective of a believer.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.160]   Are we adverse to adversity?
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.800]   Are we prone to chasing prosperity?
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.000]   Where's your mindset in that?
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.600]   Be sober, approach life with a level head.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.880]   And so you, I say, "Okay, I'm coming to the end now.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.320]   "You talked about perspective of life and death.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.520]   "You talked about perspective on adversity and prosperity,
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.000]   "but I want some practical advice.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.680]   "What does my day look like today?
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.360]   "What does my day look like next week?"
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.160]   As you see all these things, Kohelet, preacher,
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.360]   gatherer of wisdom, you see all the things that happen,
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.760]   you see that it's like this, how do we live?
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:11.280]   What is something practical that we does?
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.600]   And he goes through a few verses
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.880]   that I will just fly through a little bit,
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.520]   but he does give some practical advice.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.240]   In verses five to 10, he talks about this.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.800]   And see if I can fly through a few of them for you.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.200]   Verse five, "It is better for a man to hear the rebuke
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.160]   "of the wise than to hear the song of fools."
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.760]   He's saying, "Don't be flattered."
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.680]   When you live life, if you want some practical advice,
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:31.280]   here it is, don't be flattered.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.200]   Don't surround yourself with people who will agree with you.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.760]   Don't surround yourself with people
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.880]   who will only tell you the things that you want to hear.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.400]   Don't be easily flattered, that's number one.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.560]   And then he carries on.
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.400]   "Better is the end of a thing than it is the beginning,
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:47.720]   "and the patient spirit is better than the proud spirit."
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.960]   Be patient, be patient, don't be impatient, don't be angry.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.840]   Why?
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.520]   Because when you're impatient, you are not loving.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.040]   What?
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.680]   But 1 Corinthians 13 says, "Love is patient."
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.320]   So if you're being impatient, you're actually not
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.920]   being loving and you're not trusting in God.
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.560]   Gabriel preached on this, Ecclesiastes 3,
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.280]   "There is a time for everything."
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.560]   You recognize that God is in control of everything
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.440]   in all the timing.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.720]   So when you are being impatient, what are you doing?
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.280]   You're not trusting in God, right?
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.080]   You're not loving Him in the way that you should,
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.800]   so don't be impatient.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.400]   And then he carries on.
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.080]   Oh, verse 10, "Say not, 'Why were the former days
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.120]   "better than these?'
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.560]   "For it is not from wisdom that you ask this."
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.080]   Don't be proud and discontent.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.240]   Who's ever said that?
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:44.720]   The good old days, this is not like the good old days.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.240]   Hong Kong has changed so much.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.640]   This Hong Kong is nothing like the Hong Kong of the '90s.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.320]   Don't we say that?
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.600]   Oh, young people these days, they're idiots.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.360]   Right?
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.600]   He says, "Don't say that."
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.440]   Why?
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.600]   Because you're being prideful.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.560]   Because you're being discontent with what it is.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.600]   Because nothing new is happening under the sun.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.480]   So stop making your comments from your rose-tinted glasses.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.680]   Because here's the problem.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.480]   When you start comparing these days to those days,
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.920]   that comparison breeds discontentment.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.440]   That discontentment breeds resentment.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.080]   It's pride.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.120]   Don't do that.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.480]   We all love those elderly women or men
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.000]   who are just so gracious and gentle and patient,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.520]   even though they've been through everything.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.680]   They've seen all the financial crises.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.280]   They've been through the wars.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.440]   They've seen everything,
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.360]   yet they are just so patient with us.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.760]   You don't hear them saying, "The good old days."
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.880]   They don't make it like this anymore.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.160]   Because they have the right perspective.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.040]   And Kohelet's asking us to have that perspective.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.120]   And I'll finish here.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.560]   Because again, if you look at chapter seven,
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:11.920]   please, when you go home and look at it,
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.360]   he jumps around and bounces around in lots of places.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:16.560]   He talks about perspective,
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.240]   then he gives a few wisdoms, droplets of wisdom,
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.840]   and then he just carries on
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.840]   with some more perspective issues.
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:24.520]   And then he finishes this chapter
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.560]   with something which is interesting,
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.880]   because he's talking about how to be wise.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.600]   And then towards the end of it, from 16 onwards,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.320]   he's actually, "You know what?
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.960]   This whole wisdom thing,
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.480]   it's not really what it's cracked out to be."
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.880]   He says, "Be not overly righteous
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.360]   and do not make yourself too wise.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.720]   Why should you destroy yourself?
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.400]   Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.080]   Why should you die before your time?"
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.240]   And then he's, so he's basically attacking wisdom.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.360]   He's like, you know what he's actually saying here?
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.520]   Avoid extremism.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.640]   Don't be too conservative and rigid,
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.240]   but don't be immoral and go all the way to this side either.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.720]   Avoid those extremes.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.000]   Going to the States,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.320]   and actually anywhere in the world right now,
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.280]   we see how polarized everything is, right?
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:19.160]   Republicans and Democrats and conservatives and liberals
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.080]   and all these other colors
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.480]   that we're using to identify with a color,
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.720]   and everyone's just going to the extremes.
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.720]   And Cohen is here saying, "You know what all those are?
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.520]   Those are all earthly wisdom at best.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.400]   At best, they are earthly wisdom."
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:39.080]   Come back away from the sidelines and into the middle.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.040]   Jesus, when he assembled his 12 avengers, disciples,
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.840]   he's chose them from all along the spectrum,
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.640]   and he caught them into the middle.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.280]   And he was the most radical leader ever
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.840]   because he realized, he had the perspective
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.720]   that these sections here, these divisions here
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.560]   are not important here.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.360]   They are not important.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.040]   They are earthly wisdom at best.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.240]   And Cohen here is saying, and he says this in verse 20,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.080]   which I think I do have,
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.400]   "Surely there is not a righteous man on earth
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.160]   who does good and never sins.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:18.600]   All this I have tested by wisdom.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.760]   I said I will be wise, but it was far from me."
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.960]   He's like, "I've tried.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.360]   I've asked for wisdom.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.680]   I have seen everything.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.200]   And if it's to be believed,
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.320]   some people believe this is Solomon,
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.520]   the wisest man that ever lived,
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.520]   who asked God for wisdom and got it.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.480]   But he said, "I've tried.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.680]   I've got everything, all the wisdom, all the observations,
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.120]   and it's still so far from me.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.240]   It has still eluded me.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.360]   You can't get it.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.200]   There is nothing."
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.920]   And then he finishes with this really depressing statement
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.320]   towards the end, "See, this alone I found,
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.280]   that God made man upright,
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.680]   but they have sought out many schemes,
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.440]   that God made us this way,
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.640]   but then we have sought out many schemes.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.680]   We have gone another way."
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.760]   So that's why he says in verse 20,
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.680]   "Surely there is not a righteous man on earth
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.120]   who does good and never sins."
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:12.960]   Why?
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.080]   Because we may have wisdom,
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.720]   but sometimes we don't act on it.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.480]   Solomon, the most wise man ever.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.560]   Have you seen how he ends his life?
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.640]   Have you seen how many,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.320]   have you heard how many concubines he had?
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.840]   Everyone knows one wife is more than enough.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.760]   That wasn't very wise.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:40.480]   Because it's one thing knowing what to do,
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.640]   and then it's another thing actually doing it.
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.560]   And he says, "You know what?
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.000]   I've seen it all.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.040]   You can't even get that kind of wisdom."
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.240]   Romans 7, that's what he's doing,
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.680]   and that's what we are.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.800]   "For we know what we should do, but we don't,
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.440]   and we know what we shouldn't do, but we do.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.680]   Every time I try doing something good,
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.040]   sin is right there with me."
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.960]   And what does Paul say?
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.240]   "What wretched men we are.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.240]   What wretched men we are."
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.440]   And that's what Kohelet here is saying.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:11.520]   He's like, "You may just even give up
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.520]   that search for wisdom.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.360]   I've been everywhere.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.200]   I've seen everything.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.040]   I can't find it.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.880]   I don't know where it is."
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:21.080]   We are not capable of attaining that wisdom
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.400]   and acting on it.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.680]   There is no one who is upright
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.920]   and no one who ever sins.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.080]   And it's interesting for us,
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.560]   because as a species, as a race,
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.160]   we're trying to improve ourselves over the years,
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.920]   whether it's technology, science, medicine,
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.680]   all these things, we're trying to improve our lives.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.400]   We're trying to extend our lives.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.840]   And yes, maybe the quantity of our days are extended,
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:44.000]   but the quality, are we really that much wiser?
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.200]   Is this world really that much better
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.560]   in our pursuit for wisdom, in our pursuit in science,
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.680]   in our pursuit in all these things?
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.040]   Are we still in the same place?
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.840]   In fact, in those pursuits,
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.440]   aren't we also bringing the end of the world closer?
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.600]   And that's Kohelet's observation.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:05.040]   BC, and this is where I'll finish.
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.160]   He said he'd seen everything.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.840]   He said he'd seen every man
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.560]   and there was no one who's upright.
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.840]   But who didn't he see?
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.880]   Because he lived in a time in the Old Testament
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.600]   where he didn't get a chance to see one who was upright,
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.320]   who was perfect.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:28.680]   And as we sang earlier, that King,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.160]   that King from heaven, who came to earth,
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.640]   he was upright.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:39.960]   He did have wisdom and he did live it out.
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.880]   Of course, that person is Jesus.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.440]   Kohelet was a wise man.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.280]   He made so many observations
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.080]   and they're all good practical advice.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.320]   And unfortunately, he makes these conclusions
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.600]   which are not wrong.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:58.680]   But then if you fast forward, as the story continues,
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:04.400]   he would know, and I'm sure he finally got to meet
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.080]   there was one who was wise.
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:11.480]   There was one who was truly perfect, who did never sin.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.880]   1 Corinthians 1, many years later,
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.920]   Paul talks about this issue of wisdom.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.640]   He says, "Where is the one who is wise?
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.720]   "Where is described?
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.160]   "Where is the debater of this age?
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.720]   "Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:27.840]   "For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.640]   "but we preach Christ crucified."
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:38.280]   And Jesus himself, Jesus himself is the wisdom of God.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.200]   He is the one who is upright.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.040]   He is the one who is wise.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.200]   So if you want any practical advice on how to live,
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:52.400]   if you want any practical advice on how to be better off,
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.800]   look to Jesus.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.800]   Find your answer in Jesus.
[00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.760]   If you are struggling with your perspective
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.720]   on life and death, look to Jesus,
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.920]   because he came and he defeated death
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:11.000]   so that people like me are no longer afraid of death,
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.040]   because I know what it really just is.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.840]   It's just here.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.480]   If you are struggling with your life
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.880]   and there are challenges and there is adversity,
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.120]   or you are also blessed with prosperity,
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.360]   and you're wondering, "What do I do?"
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.200]   Look to Jesus.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.240]   Jesus is the only one who is wise.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.640]   Focus on this book.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.800]   This book, all these chapters from before,
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.320]   point to him.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.760]   He is the wisdom.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.240]   He is the power of God.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.720]   He is the very thing we need to navigate this world
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.040]   that is so gray, that is so up and down,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.120]   that is so messed up.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:57.680]   Focus on him.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   Jesus is the centre and the answer to everything.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.320]   Find him and the answers will be there.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.160]   Let's pray.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.480]   (footsteps)
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:21.120]   Father, we come before you with broken hearts,
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:27.640]   because we look at this world and we see so much suffering.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.520]   We see so much death.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.920]   We see so much adversity.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:36.960]   We see so much prosperity that is blinding the eyes
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.960]   of those who have it.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:45.560]   But we come before you and we ask you to once again
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.440]   turn our sorrow into joy, our suffering into rejoicing.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   And we wait for you and we take heart
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.160]   because we know that you have overcome the world
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.640]   despite all its troubles.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:04.320]   So let us not grow cynical.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.640]   Let us not grow prideful.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.280]   Let us approach life and death,
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.440]   adversity and prosperity through your lens.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:21.320]   Every challenge we face, let us bring back to you.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.960]   Every victory we have, let us boast only in you.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:32.360]   Every day we live, let us live for you.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.480]   We live today for that day.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:43.120]   We thank you.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.160]   In your name we pray.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.920]   Amen.
