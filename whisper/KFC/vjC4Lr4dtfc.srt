1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
 I'll be honest with you all, and I shared this with some of you, I had a bit of a difficult

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,360
 time preparing for the sermon.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,320
 And the reason for this is because I was struggling to figure out what this book meant, what Ecclesiastes

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,320
 meant.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,160
 You know, the first step to preparing a sermon or studying the Bible is to try to figure

6
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,400
 out what is the author trying to say.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,320
 Read the word and see what God is speaking through the author.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,840
 And I was stuck at this step.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,960
 I don't know about you, but I find Ecclesiastes a bit of a difficult book to interpret.

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,280
 I find Paul's writings pretty, or much easier to understand, maybe because I'm a bit of

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,400
 a logical guy, I'm a math and science type of guy, and Paul is very logical, we vibe.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,300
 He goes like, A is true because of B and C, therefore point D.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,600
 On the other hand, Ecclesiastes isn't as straightforward.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,780
 There's logic in it for sure, but we kind of have to look at the whole book and piece

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,840
 together the message of the book.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,880
 There are opposing points held in tension.

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,960
 Sometimes he's quite negative about life.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,600
 He says, "So I hated life because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,000
 all is vanity and a striving after wind."

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,600
 But at other times he's positive and there's real wisdom in what he's saying.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,440
 He also says, "I know that it will be well with those who fear God, because they fear

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
 before him."

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,800
 So as I'm reading this, I'm kind of thinking, make up your mind, do you hate life or do

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,880
 you not?

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,480
 Is there wisdom or is there not?

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,760
 What is going on?

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,720
 And as I was reading through the book, chewing through the preacher's train of thought, and

28
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,720
 recall there's two characters in Ecclesiastes.

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,520
 The author of the book, who shows up in the beginning and the end, but for the most part

30
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,080
 the author is relaying the words of this character called Koheleth.

31
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,360
 You'll also see him called the preacher or the teacher in our translations.

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,560
 Those are the meanings of this title Koheleth.

33
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,440
 But anyways, as I was struggling to make sense of the book, I thought maybe that's how Koheleth

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,320
 felt as well, trying to make sense of life.

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,560
 I think part of why Ecclesiastes is confusing and perplexing at times is because life itself

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,720
 is also confusing and perplexing.

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,320
 This book is wisdom literature.

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,880
 It shows us life as it is and reflects to us the reality of life back to us.

39
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:40,880
 Maybe this book isn't always linear and one-dimensional because life also isn't linear and one-dimensional.

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,900
 Life in Ecclesiastes has layers, like an onion or like Shrek.

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,480
 Life has layers and Ecclesiastes has layers.

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,440
 And my view of the book is that life is full of meaning when we know God.

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,080
 But even when we turn to Christ, there's still a real tint of vanity and frustration in this

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
 life.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,960
 And I know you guys can maybe feel that.

46
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,780
 Or at least we still live in a world that is colored by vanity and frustration.

47
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,800
 We live in a broken world.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,300
 We're living in what some call the already but not yet.

49
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,260
 Christ has already died and we already enjoy all the blessings that come from that.

50
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,920
 But he has yet to return and he has yet to make all things new.

51
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,080
 We are people who are already saved but we still yet live in a fallen world.

52
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,000
 I think in that lies some of the paradoxes and tensions in Ecclesiastes.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,440
 The book is perplexing yet filled with meaning because life here and now under the sun in

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,960
 this life is perplexing but filled with meaning.

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,320
 And that's still true for us who know Christ but even more so for Koheleth who doesn't

56
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,520
 have the fuller picture yet.

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,840
 So I think that Koheleth here does speak true wisdom and he takes us on a journey wading

58
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,440
 through the frustrations of life.

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,760
 He does see God at work in the world but he doesn't see the full picture behind God's

60
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,580
 purpose in Christ.

61
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:09,380
 He saw in a mirror dimly to steal the words of Paul like how we also see in a mirror dimly

62
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,040
 and know in part.

63
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,640
 We like Koheleth are still working through the complexities and frustration of life now

64
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,360
 under the sun.

65
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,780
 Now with that in mind let's turn to chapter three.

66
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,760
 Chapter three is about time and toil.

67
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,520
 What's the point of the time we have under the sun here and now and what gain is there

68
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,560
 from all our toil under the sun.

69
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,560
 Koheleth lays out his thesis for this chapter in verse one.

70
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,360
 For everything there is a season and a time for every matter under heaven.

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,660
 In other words there is a time for everything.

72
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,440
 And Koheleth makes this point beautifully with a poem.

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,800
 It's quite a famous poem in fact.

74
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,400
 Maybe some of the older and wiser members of our congregation like Pastor John will

75
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,280
 remember a song from the 60s by the Byrds.

76
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,940
 They turned this poem into a song and it actually reached number one on the Billboard Top 100.

77
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,560
 But Koheleth takes us through a bunch of opposites.

78
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,940
 For example there's a time to be born and a time to die opposites.

79
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,880
 This poem isn't meant to be a comprehensive list of everything that happens in this life

80
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,080
 but he's using opposites to convey everything in the full spectrum that happens under the

81
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
 sun.

82
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,720
 Things happen here on earth.

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
 And also we can note that this poem isn't commanding us to do anything.

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,940
 It's a descriptive not prescriptive.

85
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:42,060
 The poem paints a picture and describes things that happen in this life.

86
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,700
 It's not, there's no command in here per se.

87
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,260
 It's not prescribing us to do anything right now.

88
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:52,940
 However there's still wisdom in understanding that there are in fact different times and

89
00:05:52,940 --> 00:06:00,220
 different seasons in life and there's wisdom in living according to these differences.

90
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,580
 Verse two begins by saying there is a time to be born and a time to die.

91
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,420
 A time to plant and a time to pluck up what is planted.

92
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,540
 This verse refers to the beginning and end of life.

93
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:19,380
 I'm here right now because there was a time when I was born, March 31st, 1995.

94
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,060
 And unless Christ returns soon there will also be a time for me to die.

95
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,220
 And there will be a time for all of us to die.

96
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,220
 Time to plant and time to pluck up what is planted, that is the same idea.

97
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,340
 The beginning and end of life for plants.

98
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,980
 Verse three, a time to kill and a time to heal.

99
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,340
 A time to break down and a time to build up.

100
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,620
 Like verse two this refers to the beginning and end of things.

101
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,100
 Destruction and growth.

102
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,180
 Just across the street from where I live right now they tore down a parking lot and now they're

103
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,340
 building up a new apartment or some new stores.

104
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,940
 So breaking down and building up, we see this in this life.

105
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,100
 Verse four talks about emotions.

106
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,500
 There's a time to weep and a time to laugh.

107
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,540
 A time to mourn and a time to dance.

108
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,100
 There's both happy times and there's sad times.

109
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,020
 And this is true even in the Christian life, there's ups and downs.

110
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,740
 Romans 12 says, "Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep."

111
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,220
 There's both rejoicing and weeping here and now under the sun.

112
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,460
 And from this we can draw two observations from what we've seen so far.

113
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,020
 One is that we can't always control the times that we live in.

114
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,860
 We can't control when we die and we certainly can't control when we were born.

115
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,500
 We weren't born yet.

116
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,580
 And secondly, we should live wisely according to the times.

117
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,860
 There's a time to laugh but there's also a time to weep and mourn.

118
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,620
 Suppose you had a friend who was grieving the loss of a loved one.

119
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,100
 That's the time to mourn.

120
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,820
 You'd give them a hug, bring them tissues, cry with them.

121
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,220
 It's not the time to cheer them up by cracking jokes or making them laugh.

122
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,220
 It's not the time for that.

123
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,980
 That'd be inappropriate.

124
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,420
 It's not the time to be dancing or laughing.

125
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,900
 So there's different times and seasons in life.

126
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,840
 We can't always control them but we can live wisely according to them.

127
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,860
 You might want it to be the time to dance and laugh but if it's the time to mourn, you

128
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,860
 can't force it or control it.

129
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,100
 Let's continue in verse 5.

130
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,140
 A time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together.

131
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,020
 A time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing.

132
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,460
 Here casting away stones might refer to clearing a field like how they tore down the parking

133
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:48,560
 lot across from my apartment or gathering stones together in building up something again.

134
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,320
 There's also a time to embrace and there is a time for COVID.

135
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,120
 We know this all too well.

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,780
 Verse 6 deals with possessions.

137
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:06,800
 There's a time to seek and a time to lose, a time to keep and a time to cast away.

138
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,480
 There's a time to look for things and there's a time to give up and let go of something

139
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,520
 or maybe even someone.

140
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,140
 For example, if you're kayaking in Mui Wo and your phone falls into the ocean, you'd

141
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:25,600
 probably look for it but after a few hours or days, it's a time to give up, to lose,

142
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,240
 to carry on.

143
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,680
 Time to seek and a time to lose.

144
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
 Verse 7.

145
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,220
 There's a time to tear and a time to sew.

146
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,060
 Maybe this refers to the practice at the time of tearing your garments when you're mourning

147
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,360
 and then sewing it back together when that time is over or it could tie in with the next

148
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
 line.

149
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,760
 There's a time to be silent and sew your mouth shut so to speak and a time to speak up.

150
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,900
 Verse 8.

151
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,860
 A time to love and a time to hate.

152
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:00,720
 Time for war and a time for peace.

153
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,520
 We're very well aware now that there's both times for war and peace, for better or for

154
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,560
 worse.

155
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,760
 And we went quickly through these verses but again, the overall meaning of this poem here

156
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,360
 is that there's a time for everything and Kohele uses these opposites to illustrate

157
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,360
 that.

158
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,400
 It means that there's a time when everything happens.

159
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,740
 It happened in the past and it will continue to happen in the future and we can't always

160
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,700
 control what happens but there's still wisdom in knowing that there's different seasons

161
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,700
 in life and wisdom in acting accordingly based on the time and season that you're in.

162
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,080
 So we've established that there's a time for everything.

163
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
 So what?

164
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,520
 How does this relate to the rest of chapter 3?

165
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,360
 Well I think Kohele holds two viewpoints in tension.

166
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,640
 The first is that it's all hevel.

167
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,600
 It's all vanity.

168
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,980
 We talked about this word in previous weeks.

169
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,680
 It's a key word that occurs over and over in Ecclesiastes, though not much in chapter

170
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,200
 3, only once in verse 19 I believe.

171
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,840
 And it's translated vanity in the English Standard Version.

172
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,040
 As we talked about previously, it can mean futility, the lack of substance, profitlessness,

173
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
 pointlessness.

174
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,840
 There's also a sense of transience like a wind or vapor.

175
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,120
 If there is meaning, it escapes us like striving after the wind.

176
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,160
 And one response to this poem that Kohele brings forth is that life is confusing, it's

177
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,000
 perplexing, it's temporary.

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,920
 In verse 9, Kohele resumes his thought about work and toil from chapter 2, which Johnny

179
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,880
 preached about last week.

180
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,220
 He asks a rhetorical question.

181
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,460
 What gain has the worker from his toil?

182
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,220
 And he's not asking this question as if he didn't know.

183
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,180
 He's making the point here that there is no gain.

184
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,560
 Johnny taught us this last week in chapter 2.

185
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,240
 As Kohele reflects on work, he realizes and comes to the conclusion that it's all vanity

186
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,320
 and a striving after wind.

187
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,320
 We can see also that chapter 3 echoes chapter 1, where the author of the book sets forth

188
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,760
 the vanity of vanities.

189
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,840
 In verse 9, we have the same rhetorical question as in chapter 1, verse 3.

190
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,040
 What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?

191
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,800
 Again implying no gain, vanity of vanities.

192
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,720
 Also we see opposites in this poem.

193
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,480
 There's a time to be born and a time to die, echoing bits of chapter 1.

194
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,040
 A generation goes and a generation comes.

195
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,720
 The sun rises, the sun goes down.

196
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,160
 The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north.

197
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,280
 There's a time for everything, but at the same time, there is nothing new under the

198
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,760
 sun.

199
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,880
 All the things in chapter 3 have already happened before.

200
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
 There's been birth and death.

201
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,080
 There's been killing, healing, weeping, laughter, mourning, and dance.

202
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,120
 There's been seeking, losing, keeping, casting away, love, war, hate, war, peace.

203
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,840
 All these things have happened before.

204
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,360
 There's nothing new under the sun.

205
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,200
 Yet Koheles seems to give us a glimmer of hope.

206
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:29,840
 He says in verse 11, "God has made everything beautiful in its time, and God has put eternity

207
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
 into man's heart."

208
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,840
 That sounds great, and it is great.

209
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,720
 God has beautifully arranged all the times.

210
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,200
 There's a purpose behind the things that are going on here on earth.

211
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,360
 It sounds wonderful on the surface, but there's a catch here at the end of verse 11.

212
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,440
 It says, "Yet so that he, or man, cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to

213
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,960
 the end."

214
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,440
 The beautiful ordering of times and eternity in our hearts is actually a source of frustration

215
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
 for Koheles.

216
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,880
 We can't see God's purposes, and it's frustrating.

217
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,000
 We can't see the meaning and purpose behind the things that are happening.

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,320
 There's war in Ukraine, there's a global pandemic, or why did she of all people get cancer?

219
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,080
 She was such a nice person.

220
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,560
 Why did he die so young?

221
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,360
 It all seems unfair.

222
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,360
 We only see a limited perspective, what's happening right in front of us in our lifetime.

223
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,120
 There's frustration there because we can't see beyond our perspective.

224
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,640
 We want to see eternity and the bigger purpose behind the things that are happening right

225
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,400
 now.

226
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,120
 It's kind of like an unfinished melody or an unresolved cadence.

227
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:52,280
 You guys know Beethoven's 5th symphony, it's a famous melody.

228
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,040
 But if I stop there, it's not satisfying, it's uncomfortable.

229
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,160
 You want to hear that last note.

230
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,240
 You want to know the purpose behind that whole song.

231
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,280
 That's what's going on here.

232
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,920
 God has put eternity in our hearts, but under the sun, the music is cut short, the movie

233
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,600
 ends early, all we see is right here, right now.

234
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,920
 There's only life under the sun.

235
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,080
 If that is true, if there's only life in this world, here and now, life in this age, then

236
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,760
 all is vanity and striving after wind.

237
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,720
 It's frustrating.

238
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,840
 Back to chapter 2, we can be hedonists, we can seek for pleasure, we can laugh, eat,

239
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,920
 enjoy our lives, but we all die.

240
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,680
 All is vanity and a striving after wind.

241
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,960
 We can live wisely, but everyone dies.

242
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,680
 So what's the point in living wisely?

243
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,360
 Why not just YOLO and do whatever you want?

244
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,480
 That also is vanity.

245
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,600
 What gain is there in work?

246
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,840
 You might work hard, but because of politics, you get passed up for the promotion, you don't

247
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,600
 get what you deserve.

248
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,280
 Or your boss gives you a lot of work at the last minute, you work overtime until 1am,

249
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,360
 but then the client changes his mind and all your work is scrapped at the end.

250
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,360
 That also is vanity.

251
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,540
 And we want to know the purpose behind the frustrations of this life.

252
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,640
 God has put eternity in our hearts.

253
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,520
 We're searching for meaning, meaning that is there.

254
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,840
 We might be able to feel the wind blowing, but meaning escapes us.

255
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,760
 We're striving after wind.

256
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:30,160
 So on one hand, Kohalath looks at the world and he sees that it's all heavel, it's vanity.

257
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,960
 But on the other hand, he reflects on the times and concludes a second thing, that everything

258
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,040
 happens for a purpose, so that we fear God.

259
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,560
 There's a time for everything under the sun and the purpose is so that we fear God.

260
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,640
 To clarify, when I say fear God here, I don't mean to be afraid or scared of God.

261
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,040
 I mean to fear him as in respecting and revering him.

262
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,680
 You can replace the word fear with worshipping God, perhaps.

263
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,320
 While life is frustrating, Kohalath perceives that God has appointed all the times.

264
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,960
 The one who sits above the sun has arranged and ordered all the things that happen under

265
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,160
 the sun.

266
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,320
 Verse 10 says, "I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be

267
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
 busy with."

268
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,840
 You see, God has done it.

269
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,280
 Or verse 14, "I perceive that whatever God does endures forever.

270
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,320
 Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken away from it."

271
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,400
 Again, God has done it and what he does endures forever.

272
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,000
 We sang today about God's sovereignty, that he is sovereign over us.

273
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,140
 That is what Ecclesiastes is talking about here.

274
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,200
 God reigns above all.

275
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,160
 Our God is in the heavens and he does all that he pleases.

276
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,440
 Nothing can be added to what God has done, to God's plan, nor anything taken away from

277
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
 it.

278
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,840
 He is sovereign and we cannot fight his purposes.

279
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,200
 We see in verse 14 that God exercises his sovereignty for a reason, with a purpose.

280
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,800
 And that is, "so that people fear before him."

281
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,280
 See God has appointed the times.

282
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,280
 He has made the world so that, with a purpose, that we fear him.

283
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,500
 Everything that happens under the sun, God works out everything so that we know him and

284
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,340
 love him.

285
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,080
 And this doesn't mean that bad things will never happen.

286
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,400
 There's still injustice, there's sorrow and death.

287
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,200
 But what I mean is that everything, including birth and death, weeping, laughing, love and

288
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,240
 hate, war and peace, God's purpose for everything that happens under the sun is so that we know

289
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,040
 him, love him, and trust him.

290
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,640
 Paul says this in Romans 8.

291
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:54,320
 He says there's this glory that awaits us, but also in verse 20, "For creation was subjected

292
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,120
 to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope that creation

293
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,700
 itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory

294
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,360
 of the children of God."

295
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,880
 So God subjected the world to futility and frustration.

296
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,640
 But this futility does not escape his control.

297
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,200
 God is in control over disease and war, injustice and death.

298
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,040
 And also, this futility isn't arbitrary.

299
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,520
 God isn't playing games with us.

300
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,440
 God subjected the world to futility in hope.

301
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,600
 He does it so that all of creation would find hope and freedom in him, in fearing him, knowing

302
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,120
 him and loving him.

303
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,000
 There is a glory and hope that awaits us.

304
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,220
 God made the world for us to enjoy, and he made it good.

305
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,040
 It wasn't futile in the beginning.

306
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,000
 But we all sinned against him and rebelled against him.

307
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,800
 And so he subjected the world to futility in order to point our sinful hearts back to

308
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,280
 him so that we wouldn't rest our hope and joy in the things he has made, but in God

309
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,080
 alone.

310
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,320
 If the pursuit of worldly pleasure gave us meaning, then we would make pleasure our God.

311
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,040
 If work gave us meaning, then we would make work our God.

312
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,560
 But all these things pale in comparison to knowing God.

313
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,840
 God is greater than all these things that we might hope in.

314
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,220
 And so God made life frustrating.

315
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,080
 He gave futility so that we wouldn't find our purpose and meaning in those things, but

316
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,480
 we would look to him and find freedom.

317
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,800
 And this frustration is really there, even for us who know Christ.

318
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,800
 Paul continues, "For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the

319
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,080
 pains of childbirth until now.

320
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,640
 And not only the creation, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit, grown

321
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,800
 inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies."

322
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,820
 We who are saved, who have the Spirit of Christ in us, still live in a world that is marked

323
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,820
 by futility.

324
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,720
 There's still suffering and frustration.

325
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,840
 And as we groan inwardly, waiting for the hope of redemption, when Christ returns and

326
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,800
 make all things new, we still do that.

327
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,080
 We still sense this futility.

328
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,960
 And I think, actually, in a way, the whole book of Ecclesiastes actually meanders to

329
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
 this point.

330
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,440
 I think that Ecclesiastes is a bit of an exposition of the point in Romans 8.

331
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,380
 God subjected the world to futility so that we would discover that our ultimate purpose

332
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,060
 and meaning is found in God alone.

333
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:43,140
 After 12 chapters of Cohele's Reflections on Life, the author of Ecclesiastes concludes

334
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
 like this.

335
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,780
 He says, "The end of the matter, all has been heard.

336
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,780
 Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.

337
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,380
 For God will bring every deed into judgment with every secret thing, whether good or evil."

338
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,740
 At the end of it, after Cohele reflects on all the intricacies of life, good times, bad

339
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:12,100
 times, meaning and vanity, the author concludes that behind it all, our ultimate purpose is

340
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,820
 to fear God.

341
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,220
 The Westminster Catechism states it another way.

342
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,780
 It asks the question, "What is the chief end of man?

343
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,780
 What is our ultimate purpose?"

344
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:29,340
 The answer, "Man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever."

345
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:34,020
 Restatement in a way of the end of Ecclesiastes 12.

346
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,940
 Our ultimate purpose is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever.

347
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,980
 God is better than anything in this life, pleasure, work, wisdom.

348
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:51,420
 And we find our ultimate meaning in glorifying him and enjoying him forever.

349
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,780
 That is why we live and breathe.

350
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,500
 He is the one who gives us joy.

351
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,420
 My question to us is, do we see life this way?

352
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,700
 Do we see God in this way?

353
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,800
 Do you live to glorify God?

354
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,460
 Is he your greatest joy?

355
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:12,600
 And if not, that may be a reason why life is extra frustrating on top of this futility.

356
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,780
 If we're not living according to our ultimate purpose and meaning, it's no surprise that

357
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:21,340
 life will feel purposeless and meaningless.

358
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:26,380
 This is a silly example, but it's like trying to sweep the floor with an orange.

359
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,700
 You're on your knees rubbing an orange on the ground and thinking and being frustrated,

360
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,500
 "Wow, this is a terrible broom."

361
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
 Of course it is.

362
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,140
 That's not the purpose of an orange.

363
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,620
 You're meant to peel it and eat it.

364
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,180
 That's not the point.

365
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,780
 And I think when we live without God, when we don't live to glorify him and enjoy him

366
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,380
 forever, we're doing that.

367
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,660
 We were made to fear God, to have a relationship with him.

368
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,220
 We were created so that we would be his people and he would be our God.

369
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,480
 I'm going to run through six reasons why we should fear God.

370
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,580
 Number one, God is the creator and source of all things.

371
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,060
 Verse 10 says, "I've seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be

372
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,780
 busy with."

373
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,060
 There is a time for everything and God made all of it.

374
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,780
 The time that we have, the life that we have, all of it originates from God.

375
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,340
 John 1 says of Jesus, "All things were made through him and without him was not anything

376
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,500
 made that was made."

377
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,900
 See God is the ultimate reality.

378
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,140
 We are not.

379
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:38,100
 God always exists, but our existence is completely dependent on him.

380
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,740
 He created us and in fact we would even cease to exist if it were not for God continuing

381
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,220
 to will us to exist, upholding us by the word of his power.

382
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,100
 Reason number two, God is eternal.

383
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,340
 God is eternal and we are not.

384
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:58,420
 There is not a moment when God did not exist and there will never be a moment when God

385
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,460
 does not exist.

386
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,420
 He is the only one without beginning and end.

387
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,960
 He is the alpha and omega.

388
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,060
 God has put eternity in our hearts, but we are finite.

389
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,860
 Verse 20 says, "All are from the dust and to dust all will return."

390
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,620
 But God endures forever.

391
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,860
 Reason number three is that God is sovereign.

392
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,780
 Verse 14 says, "Whatever God does endures forever.

393
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,460
 Nothing can be added to it nor anything taken away from it."

394
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,180
 God's will is absolute.

395
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,260
 Nothing escapes his control.

396
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,540
 Psalm 115 says, "Our God is in the heavens.

397
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,100
 He does all that he pleases."

398
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,740
 Nothing can be added to the will of God nor anything taken away from it.

399
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,860
 There is a time for everything, but God is sovereign over all of it.

400
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,860
 Birth and death, laughter, sorrow, war and peace.

401
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,340
 God is in control of everything.

402
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,980
 He is sovereign.

403
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,820
 And I mean absolutely everything.

404
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,660
 Abraham Kuyper famously said, "There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human

405
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:10,220
 existence over which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry, 'Mine.'

406
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,620
 God is sovereign."

407
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,100
 Reason three.

408
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,500
 Reason number four is that God is good.

409
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,500
 I don't want God's sovereignty to fly over our heads as an abstract doctrine.

410
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,100
 The sovereignty of God is meant to be beautiful.

411
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,380
 God's sovereignty deserves a front row seat in our hearts as our joy and hope and comfort

412
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,980
 in all the times that happen under the sun.

413
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,420
 God's sovereignty is beautiful because God is good.

414
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:44,940
 Not only is God absolutely sovereign, but his sovereignty is also absolutely for us

415
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,620
 in Christ.

416
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,260
 Romans 8 says, "All things work together for the good of those who love God, for those

417
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,180
 who are called according to his purpose."

418
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,580
 We see this in verse 11.

419
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:00,020
 He has made everything beautiful in his time.

420
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:04,740
 God has arranged every time, every season in a way that is beautiful and fitting for

421
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,220
 our good.

422
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,180
 Reason number five is that God will judge.

423
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:17,300
 Verse 17 says, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is a time for every

424
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,780
 matter and for every work."

425
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,060
 God is righteous and he is the judge of all the earth.

426
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,740
 There may be injustice now in this life.

427
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,420
 The wicked prosper.

428
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:34,780
 There are fools in power, or our just system might favor the rich and powerful.

429
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,500
 But God will judge every deed one day.

430
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,900
 The judge of all the earth will do right.

431
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:47,660
 Reason six we should fear God is that we are sinners.

432
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,180
 We know this because there is a time to die.

433
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,140
 Everyone dies one day.

434
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,660
 Verse 19 says, "As one dies, so dies the other.

435
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:02,140
 Like beasts, like animals, so we too will die."

436
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,700
 And we have a problem here.

437
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,840
 The problem is that God will judge and God is sovereign.

438
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,260
 God is good, but we are not.

439
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,260
 There was no death when God created the world, but death entered the world through sin.

440
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:22,280
 All of us have rebelled against God and the wages of sin is death.

441
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,700
 Death is God's righteous punishment for sin.

442
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,140
 And so we are left with this.

443
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,320
 All will die.

444
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,740
 And so you can say life is meaningless.

445
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,260
 Life sucks, then you die.

446
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,340
 What can we do?

447
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:44,620
 Kohalath asks the question, who can bring him to see what will be after him, after he

448
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,620
 dies?

449
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,740
 All die and who can save us?

450
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,780
 Kohalath didn't really have the answer.

451
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,940
 And we can ask the same question, who can save us?

452
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,140
 Who will deliver me from this body of death?

453
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
 But now we have an answer.

454
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,200
 This be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

455
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,240
 See the sovereign God who reigns above the sun came down to the earth to save us.

456
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,760
 Jesus, the son of God, was born as a man, as one of us.

457
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,240
 He lived like us under the sun in all the times that happened under the sun.

458
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,840
 There was a time for him to laugh at the wedding in Cana.

459
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,440
 And there's time to weep, like when Lazarus, his friend, died.

460
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,640
 There's a time to gather together his disciples.

461
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:37,560
 There's also a time when Judas betrayed him and Peter denied him three times.

462
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:43,240
 Yet despite all of life's complexities, Jesus lived a perfect life, one that none of us

463
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,440
 could ever live.

464
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,120
 And still, there was a time for Jesus to die.

465
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,640
 Jesus who never sinned died on the cross for our sins, taking on himself the wrath of God

466
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,280
 that we ourselves deserve for all who believe in him.

467
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,320
 But death was not the end for him.

468
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,040
 Jesus rose from the dead on the third day so that all who believe in him would be saved

469
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,840
 from death also and have new life in his name.

470
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:17,560
 And so when life is meaningless, you should look to Jesus.

471
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,040
 Jesus redeemed us from the futility of death.

472
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,840
 The eternity that God put in our hearts that brought us frustration, we have that eternity

473
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,560
 in Christ.

474
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,760
 Jesus also demonstrates to us God's sovereignty.

475
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,160
 We might see injustice under the sun.

476
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,320
 Maybe you don't like the time that you're in.

477
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,100
 I don't like that it's the time to weep.

478
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,800
 You want this time to pass.

479
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,800
 Maybe there's something you want to know, a question you want answered.

480
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,160
 You don't have knowledge that you want.

481
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,120
 You have to wait.

482
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,680
 In those times, we can find hope in the fact that God is sovereign.

483
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,800
 There was also a time for the Son of God to die, for him to go through suffering.

484
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:07,880
 But also, it was so very meaningful, completely meaningful.

485
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:13,020
 And so also, our frustrations right now are difficult but meaningful.

486
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,680
 We can suffer as Christ suffered, knowing that there's glory that awaits us all.

487
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,960
 The greatest evil that ever happened in the world, the murder of the Son of God on the

488
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,040
 cross.

489
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,960
 Over that, God was sovereign.

490
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,280
 He was in control.

491
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,040
 What sinful men meant for evil, God meant it for good.

492
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,720
 If God meant the greatest evil in history for good, what in your life can he not also

493
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,340
 work for good?

494
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,840
 If he is sovereign over the death of Jesus, he is sovereign over every other thing in

495
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,360
 our lives.

496
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,880
 If God was willing to give up his own Son, if God was good in that way, what good thing

497
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:58,720
 will he withhold from us whom he loves so dearly?

498
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,480
 So Jesus demonstrates to us God's sovereignty.

499
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,700
 He also gives us a new fear of God.

500
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,040
 The word fear can have two meanings.

501
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,760
 One is to be afraid or scared of God.

502
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,340
 And that's the fear we should have had without Christ.

503
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,960
 We were under the wrath of God and were worthy of judgment.

504
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,360
 But Jesus takes that fear of God away.

505
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,400
 We are justified in Christ.

506
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,040
 It is just as if we have never sinned.

507
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,800
 In Christ, we are no longer under the wrath of God and have no longer any reason to be

508
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,800
 afraid.

509
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,800
 And instead, God gives, Jesus gives us a new fear of God.

510
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:44,320
 We now fear God not in that we are afraid of him, but now Jesus opens our eyes so that

511
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,840
 we can see the beauty and glory and awe and majesty of God, that he is eternal, he is

512
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,360
 sovereign, and he is good.

513
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,440
 And so in Christ, we can bow down before God in worship.

514
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,000
 We can love him and see him as worthy of all glory and honor and praise.

515
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,520
 That is the fear of God that Jesus gives us.

516
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,000
 He allows us to fear God and to enjoy him forever.

517
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,240
 And now we're going to respond in song.

518
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:17,600
 We'll be singing a song called "Only Holy God."

519
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,120
 There are many rhetorical questions in Ecclesiastes.

520
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,800
 Kohalath asks a lot of questions.

521
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,880
 We saw a few today.

522
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,900
 What gain has the worker from his toil?

523
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,640
 Or who can bring him to see what will be after him, after death?

524
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,600
 And the answer, again, over and over, is nothing, nobody.

525
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,600
 There's no reason.

526
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,160
 There's no gain.

527
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,040
 We'll see another set of rhetorical questions in this song.

528
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,920
 Who else commands all the hosts of heaven?

529
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,320
 Who else can make every king bow down?

530
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,880
 What other beauty demands such praises?

531
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,040
 What other splendor outshines the sun?

532
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,840
 Who else could rescue me from my failing?

533
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,560
 Who else would offer his only son?

534
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
 And what's the answer to these questions?

535
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,920
 Again, nobody.

536
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,520
 Except for one.

537
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,360
 Only our holy God.

538
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,880
 That is the meaning that we have.

539
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,600
 That is our purpose.

540
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,360
 So let us glorify God and enjoy him forever.

541
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,640
 Let's pray.

542
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:28,960
 O Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth.

543
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,240
 You, God, are beautiful, you are sovereign.

544
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,800
 You are worthy of all glory and honor and praise.

545
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,480
 You created us and you created us to know you.

546
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,280
 Lord, we pray that we would see this,

547
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,760
 that you would open our eyes to see Christ,

548
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,120
 that your spirit would work in us

549
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,360
 so that we would know you, fear you, and enjoy you forever.

550
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,560
 Help us to live wisely according to the times,

551
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,360
 the times that you've created.

552
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,040
 And Lord, use the life now,

553
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,280
 the life that we have here on earth.

554
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,120
 Use it so that we would know you

555
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,000
 and bring others to knowledge of you,

556
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,640
 to know your glory and beauty.

557
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,520
 Would we see your sovereignty and love it,

558
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,200
 would we praise you in good times and bad times.

559
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,920
 May it all point to a deeper love and joy in you.

560
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,560
 Lord, we give you thanks for all this in Jesus' name.

561
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,400
 Amen.
