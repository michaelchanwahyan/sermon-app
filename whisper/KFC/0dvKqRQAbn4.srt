1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
 It's so glad, I'm so glad to be here to be speaking with you tonight.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,520
 Now I just want to show you this.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,360
 I was going to wear this tonight when you were all here to prevent the virus from spreading,

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,520
 but apparently you are now one screen away, so this will not be needed.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,880
 I will just put this on the side.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:34,380
 This is a situation where we're least expected, but we're glad that everybody is taking precautions.

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,600
 So I'm really glad tonight to be speaking with you on a message on how we can partner

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
 with God.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,200
 Now I don't know about you, but I've been facing problems every now and then, and I

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,440
 think it's just part of life that we have problems and troubles.

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:56,880
 But the thing is, how is it that we can partner with God so that He can help us in those situations?

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,040
 And for some of us, we might be going through a hard time because we have a relationship

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,480
 problem or we might not be able to find a job and we're having a financial problem.

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,400
 And for other people, we might be having problems in our family.

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,340
 And every now and then we might come into a crisis and we just want to call out to God.

16
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,320
 But how is it that we can work with God so that God can work through us and that we can

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
 see His miracles?

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,800
 So today we're going to find out the secrets on how to do that.

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,920
 Now we're going to be studying Judges chapter four and chapter five.

20
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,320
 Now chapter four and five, they're actually telling the same story, except in chapter

21
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,120
 four, it's a narration.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,980
 So it tells us a victorious battle that God has fought for the people of Israelites.

23
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:54,600
 Now chapter five is where Deborah, the judge at that time, sings a song of victory because

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,860
 of this great battle that God has performed.

25
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,280
 So today we're going to look at both of them so that we can draw the details from both

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,480
 chapters and get the full picture.

27
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:12,720
 Now so it all started in chapter four where we find that Israelites, again, the people

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,840
 there were doing things that were evil in the sight of the Lord.

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,180
 And so the Lord gave them over to their enemies, the Canaanites.

30
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,060
 And now there was a king called King Jabin and he lives, I think I'm going to try to

31
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,180
 use this, he lives right here at Hazar.

32
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,500
 He lives very north.

33
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,800
 And now he has a commander, a military commander.

34
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,140
 His name is Seseira and he lives right here in Hiroshihagumi.

35
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:49,020
 And so what we find is that they are powerful because they have 900 chariots of iron and

36
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,860
 a very, very great army.

37
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,620
 Now the Israelites, because the Lord has given them over to their enemies, has been oppressed

38
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,220
 by them for over 20 years now.

39
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:08,740
 And so there were cruelties and they were oppressed in such a way that the roads all

40
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:15,000
 along here, they were robbers and that people would just take plunders from the Israelites.

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,020
 And at the same time, the villages were no more, meaning that they were unwalled villages

42
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,540
 and people had no crops and had no agriculture at all.

43
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,540
 So that was a time of great oppression.

44
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,540
 And what we find is that God has Deborah being the judge and she sits here, there is a palm

45
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,260
 tree named after her.

46
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,380
 It's called the Palm of Deborah.

47
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,780
 And it actually is situated between Bethel and Ramah.

48
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,900
 We're going to find that these will actually come into play where the geographic of things

49
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,900
 are.

50
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,120
 So we're just going to learn a little bit about where everything's happening.

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,400
 So now in this situation, we find that for some reason, a woman was the judge.

52
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:07,520
 And so she calls out to the Israelites military commander and his name is right here.

53
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,080
 So what is it that we...

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,040
 So Deborah here, she calls out and she says, "Barak, you are our military commander, come.

55
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,040
 Come because I have a word that I need to tell you."

56
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,480
 And so let's read it together.

57
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:31,600
 Here it says, "She sent and summoned Barak, the son of Abinoam and from Kadesh, Naphtali,

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,400
 and said to him, 'Has not the Lord, the God of Israel commanded you?

59
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,200
 Go gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the

60
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,900
 people of Zebulun.

61
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:56,160
 And I will draw out Seseirah, the general of Jabin's army to meet by the river Kishon

62
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,080
 with his chariots and his troops.

63
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,560
 I will give him into your hands.'"

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,080
 Now from these two verses, we can see that it was all God's plan to deliver the people

65
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
 of Israelites.

66
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,640
 And there was a great game plan.

67
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,740
 I mean, if we look at this, we see that this area is where the battlefield would be.

68
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,460
 And what we find is that Deborah tells him, "This is the game plan, okay?

69
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,500
 God has it all written out for you.

70
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,780
 All you need to do is carry it out because God already said that he will give your enemies

71
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,740
 into your hands."

72
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,340
 And this is what they were supposed to do.

73
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:41,380
 They were supposed to gather men from Naphtali and Zebulun and then travel to Kadesh.

74
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,980
 And then they're going to go to Mount Tabor where they're going to fight with Seseirah,

75
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,700
 the general of the enemy.

76
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:54,180
 And they're going to come here to this point where the Lord will give them over to the

77
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,340
 Israelites.

78
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,940
 Now this all sounds great, right?

79
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,660
 So now if you are Barak, what would you be thinking?

80
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,660
 "Oh, right.

81
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,740
 I just got a word from God and now I even got a confirmation from the judge, Deborah,

82
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,820
 and she's also a prophetess.

83
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,100
 So I think it's going to be a sure win."

84
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:16,980
 But somehow Barak didn't really react like that.

85
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,820
 So let's read and see how he reacted.

86
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:24,160
 And he said, "If you will go with me, I will go.

87
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,940
 But if you will not go with me, I will not go."

88
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,500
 And she said, "I will surely go with you.

89
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,720
 Nonetheless, the road on which you're going will not lead you to glory.

90
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,180
 For the Lord will sell Seseirah into the hand of a woman."

91
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,380
 So Deborah rose and he went with Barak to Kadesh.

92
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,580
 Now what we find is that for some reason, even after the confirmation from God, it was

93
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,380
 not enough for Barak to take actions.

94
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,120
 Now there is something very, very different about Deborah and Barak, right?

95
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,940
 We can find a few differences.

96
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:05,380
 One is a male, one is a female, and one is a military general, while the other one is

97
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,820
 a prophet and a judge.

98
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,100
 And we find that there's also something very critical that sets them apart.

99
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,620
 And do you know what that is?

100
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,460
 I can't really hear you from across the screen, but I'll give you the answer.

101
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,460
 It is faith.

102
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,940
 It is faith that sets them apart.

103
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,260
 So I want to bring us to a very first point, is that if we want to partner with God, if

104
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,780
 we want Him to be in our lives and help us with the situation that we're going through,

105
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,420
 we must have faith in God.

106
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:46,860
 Now as we said earlier, we found out that Barak actually realizes what God's word was,

107
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,940
 but he thinks that it's not good enough.

108
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,620
 God's word alone for Barak was not good enough.

109
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,380
 He needed more, and even a confirmation was not enough for him.

110
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,140
 He needed even more.

111
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,620
 What did he need?

112
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,580
 He needed something that he could see with his eyes.

113
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,020
 He needed visual evidence.

114
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,420
 Now on the other hand, we see that Deborah believes in God and believes in His words

115
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,260
 alone.

116
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:22,860
 And she also risks her life because when Barak says, "Will you go with me?"

117
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,260
 She said, "Okay, I'll go with you, but you just won't get the glory."

118
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,560
 So she puts her life at risk for God's word.

119
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,000
 And also, she doesn't need physical evidence.

120
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,760
 Now what we notice is that there are these two people, one with faith, that's Deborah,

121
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,240
 Barak without, and we're asking ourselves, why is it that these two people under the

122
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,560
 same circumstances, they've been oppressed in the same ways, but one has faith and one

123
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,800
 doesn't?

124
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
 Because if we find out why, maybe it will also help us have faith.

125
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,120
 Because we hear people talk about have faith in God all the time, but how is it that we

126
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,280
 can do it?

127
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,600
 Now the Bible doesn't specify, but we can look at the clues and find out what makes

128
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,600
 Barak not courageous and what makes Deborah having all this faith.

129
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:27,280
 Now let's have a look, because in previous verses, we already saw that it said that the

130
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,400
 people of Israel, how did they do?

131
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,280
 They did evil in the eyes of the Lord.

132
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,720
 What else did they do?

133
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,680
 Because they did evil, the Lord sold them to their enemy, King Jabin.

134
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,840
 And when the new gods were chosen, war was at gates.

135
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,120
 So what is it that we realize is, Barak, who is part of the Israelites, has gone through

136
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,400
 this experience, where yeah, they prayed to God, but they were doing evil at that time.

137
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,420
 And because they did evil, God gave them into their enemies.

138
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,880
 And so they've been experiencing this God that's not fighting for them, but they've

139
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:14,840
 been experiencing a God that seemed to be distant and leaving them alone.

140
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:24,000
 And so what we find is that Barak, having done evil, experiences a Lord that sells them

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
 to their enemies.

142
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,720
 And because of that, they have no faith in God and His words.

143
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,560
 Now on the contrary, we're going to find that Deborah is not the same, even though they

144
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,760
 were under the same situation.

145
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,120
 Now remember, Deborah, she is actually a prophetess and a judge.

146
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,640
 What that means was she had access to the book of laws, and she would know what is it

147
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,800
 that God likes, and she would live by them.

148
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,400
 Now how do we know that she lived by them?

149
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,380
 Well, let's see, remember how Barak reacted?

150
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,280
 He actually said that if you go with me, I will go.

151
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,120
 What is that saying?

152
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,360
 That's saying that Deborah has such a good reputation of God's presence with her, that

153
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,920
 he's willing to even risk his life.

154
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,360
 So her reputation is telling us that she has been following God and God's presence was

155
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,440
 apparent in her life.

156
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:32,040
 And at the same time, we also saw from scripture that it actually told us that she was able

157
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,600
 to judge the men of Israel, and men and people of Israel were actually going to her.

158
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,920
 So it means that because of the presence of God in her life, she was also able to teach

159
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,000
 people about who God was and how they should live their life.

160
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,680
 So in here, we also see that in chapter five, it says, "I, Deborah, arose as a mother in

161
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,360
 Israel."

162
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,720
 Now what do mothers do?

163
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,400
 Mothers discipline their children, they bring them to the right path.

164
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:11,000
 And so here we see that the reason that Deborah has so much faith is because she has been

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 doing good.

166
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,920
 She has been doing things the way that God wanted the people to do.

167
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,680
 And not only that, she teaches other people to do that when she judged for them.

168
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,420
 And we also see because of that, the Lord has been with her.

169
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,960
 And it was apparent, so apparent that people saw the presence of God in her life.

170
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,280
 And because of that, she has faith in God.

171
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,560
 And so faith is like a muscle that we have, that we can exercise.

172
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:48,360
 And if we are also like Deborah, if we choose to be like her, we can also exercise our faith

173
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
 muscle.

174
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,760
 And we can do that by following what God says.

175
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,160
 And whenever we follow what God says and God's goodness comes into our life, we actually

176
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,040
 gain more faith.

177
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,640
 And if we store up so much faith that when crisis come into our lives, we would have

178
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,040
 enough faith to just believe in God's word.

179
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,880
 And so from this, we see the very first thing that we as partners of God need to do is to

180
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,720
 have faith through doing good.

181
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,880
 Now another thing that we looked at is, we haven't looked at, we're going to look at

182
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:37,120
 now is that as they were moving north, because Deborah was going with Barak to north to have

183
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,720
 this battle, we realized that in chapter five, it actually tells us that she calls on to

184
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,880
 the different tribes.

185
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,720
 Because as she moves from here, Ephraim, all the way up to where the battlefield is,

186
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,360
 that along the way, they were singing a song to let people know, come on out, come on out,

187
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
 because the Lord is fighting for us.

188
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,640
 We need you, come on out.

189
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,800
 But we realized that not all of them responded to God.

190
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,160
 And not all of them responded to Deborah and Barak's song.

191
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:18,380
 So I have highlighted for us that all of the one in Magneta, they're the ones that responded

192
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,240
 to their calling.

193
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,120
 And the ones in blue are the ones that didn't.

194
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,680
 And they were too busy tending their flocks, too busy fighting off other enemies, or just

195
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,440
 simply for no reason.

196
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,020
 And the Bible tells us so.

197
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,920
 And so it brings us to our second point.

198
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,680
 If we want to partner with God, the very thing that we need to do is we need to also take

199
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,600
 on our responsibilities.

200
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,120
 Now we have responsibilities, just like these tribes.

201
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,740
 When God is fighting for us, we have a responsibility to react.

202
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,120
 We have a responsibility to respond to his call of action.

203
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,760
 Now I know that a lot of times we just want to sit on our couch and wait for God to do

204
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,080
 things for us.

205
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,720
 But God is not here.

206
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,960
 He's not in the business of cultivating a lot of lazy Christians.

207
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,000
 But he is in the business of partnering with us.

208
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Think about this.

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,600
 I mean, God can just send a plague down and immediately all the enemies would be gone.

210
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,000
 Why spend so much time gathering people?

211
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,640
 And it's not even a lot, it's 10,000 people.

212
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,760
 So why is it that he's doing so much?

213
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,680
 It's because he wants our partnership.

214
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,880
 How easy would it be for him to just do that?

215
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:45,080
 Now we have a Cantonese saying that when you go to someone for dinner and you want to bring

216
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,080
 something, we usually bring a chicken or something for the dinner buffet, right?

217
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:56,880
 So there's a saying that someone will bring the chicken and I will bring the soy sauce,

218
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,880
 okay?

219
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,240
 Which means that this is pretty much what's happening.

220
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,280
 Even though this is a partnership that we have with God, but really he's bringing the

221
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:10,120
 chicken, he's doing all the work, but he just wants us to participate, bring the soy sauce.

222
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,500
 And so when we partner with him, it's important that we take on our responsibilities.

223
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,620
 And if we do that, we're going to see God acting out for us.

224
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:30,820
 And so this is a saying I really like, which is, "We can't do anything if God is not here,

225
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,420
 but God won't do anything if we're not here."

226
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,620
 Okay, I want to say that again.

227
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:45,420
 We can't do anything if God is not here, but God won't do anything if we're not here, because

228
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,000
 God wants our partnership.

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,580
 This is a relationship that we have with him.

230
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:59,700
 And then so the third thing that I want to tell you is that while we partner with God,

231
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,460
 this is my favorite point, by the way.

232
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:06,500
 My favorite point is the third point, because I get to see the salvation of the Lord.

233
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:12,380
 This is the part where after we've put in our faith in what God said, and this is the

234
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:19,020
 part where we even took on our responsibilities and did what we were supposed to, God has

235
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:25,420
 the battle, and he's going to deliver us, because he knew how the ending would be even

236
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,860
 before anything happened.

237
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:33,620
 So the third part for us to really partner with God is just to see how he's going to

238
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,780
 save us.

239
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,580
 And it's so awesome to watch that.

240
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:44,380
 And in this situation where the tribes were fighting at the River of Kishon, what we find

241
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:51,020
 is that all of a sudden, even though the River of Kishon in that time of the year was a small

242
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:59,780
 stream, okay, but all of a sudden there was a cloud burst in a month that rain was unheard

243
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
 of.

244
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,060
 And all of a sudden the heaven rained.

245
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:11,260
 And what we find is that in this verse we see, "From heaven the stars fought.

246
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,220
 From their courses they fought against Cicera.

247
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,180
 The torrent Kishon swept them away.

248
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,820
 The ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon, marched on my soul."

249
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:31,100
 And so what we see here is that the Lord actually opened up the sky and it started to rain in

250
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,500
 a season that rain was impossible.

251
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,460
 And not only like a few drops of rain, it was a torrent.

252
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:44,300
 It was enough that the ground that the chariots were on became muddy and that the wheels were

253
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,620
 all stuck in the mud and we can no longer go.

254
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:54,060
 And so the Israelites were able to take the lives of those army and their enemies.

255
00:18:54,060 --> 00:19:01,220
 And so what we find here is that God is here to fight for us because he loves us.

256
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,980
 And in any situation, he wants to be a part of our lives.

257
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,460
 He wants to take care of our problems.

258
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,460
 But it's not all the time that we are actually partnering with him.

259
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,560
 A lot of times we're just on our own.

260
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:20,820
 So I just want to share a quick story about an event that happened last week.

261
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:27,260
 So last week I was told, at least my mom tells me, that there's some family businesses that

262
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,420
 I need to take care of.

263
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,740
 And I was like, "Okay, well this is not something that I really am looking forward to."

264
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:39,820
 The reason being is because the task required that I would need to talk to much older men

265
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,780
 and they were a lot craftier than I was.

266
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,940
 And I was definitely not looking forward to it.

267
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:52,580
 And so I actually sat down, because I have two sisters and they're not in Hong Kong,

268
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,540
 and so this is me and my mom, all females.

269
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,120
 And so I was thinking to myself, "All right, what kind of guy friends do I have?

270
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,740
 Maybe I'll ask that person to help.

271
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
 Nope.

272
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:08,940
 And so I went through a list of people and I realized they didn't quite fit, as in it

273
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,180
 wasn't quite right for them to help me.

274
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:19,900
 And so I suddenly remembered these two chapters, because I was also preparing for this sermon.

275
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:28,260
 And I asked myself, "Michelle, what is it that you're depending on?

276
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,140
 Are you depending on human beings, people?

277
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,260
 Are you depending on people who are more skillful than you are?

278
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,300
 Or are you going to depend on God and God alone?"

279
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,500
 And I just remembered, I said, "Yes, of course, God and God alone."

280
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,780
 And suddenly I just started to remember that God loves me so much.

281
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,380
 Not that I forgot, but it was a very deliberate thought that God loves me so much that he's

282
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,420
 going to provide for me.

283
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,980
 He's going to open the ways for me.

284
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,340
 And so the next day, even though I was a little bit scared, I texted the people that I needed

285
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,700
 to talk to, because I thought I need to fulfill my responsibility.

286
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:17,740
 I need to do, I need to act in a faithful way after I know and have faith in God.

287
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,060
 I still needed to do something.

288
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:26,780
 So I texted them and we had a chance to meet up and negotiated on some terms.

289
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,820
 And surprisingly, I have to say surprisingly, that God delivered.

290
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:39,340
 He delivered just like the way he delivered the Israelites, because they were supposed

291
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:45,740
 to be these old fox, but then they were like sheeps somehow.

292
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:51,020
 And at the same time, they agreed to pretty much all the terms that I wanted to, which

293
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:54,340
 is very, very surprising for me.

294
00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:01,020
 So you see, the story actually didn't end here for the Israelites, but I wanted to use

295
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:09,660
 my story to share with you that when we put our faith there, when we also act on it, that

296
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,780
 God will open doors in a way that we least expected.

297
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:22,420
 And when I say least expected, I want us to continue on the story where we see that Seseira

298
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:29,020
 was actually one of the only men that got away from that event when God gave them a

299
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,300
 victorious battle.

300
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,900
 And he was the only one that ran away and he went to a tent.

301
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,300
 And this tent was owned by a lady called Jeho.

302
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:47,620
 Now Jeho was actually supposed to be a family ally of the Kenyanites, but God used her in

303
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,620
 a way that helped the Israelites to get rid of this general.

304
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,520
 Now how did he do it?

305
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:04,340
 So he asked, he asked Jeho if he could take cover in refuge in her tent.

306
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,580
 And so she says, yes.

307
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,540
 And she says, turn around so I can cover you with this rug.

308
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,780
 And then he asked, could I have some water?

309
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,900
 And she says, yes, have some milk.

310
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,900
 They were curdled milk.

311
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,020
 And then he says, if anyone asks for me, just say that there's no one here.

312
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,560
 And she's like, okay.

313
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:28,360
 So she goes to her toolbox and she actually takes out a peg and also a hammer.

314
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,300
 Because in those days, women actually put up and they took down tents.

315
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,280
 So she had these tools in her female toolbox.

316
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:45,960
 And so she took it over and actually while he was sleeping, she has assassinated him.

317
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:54,400
 And so what we find is that who would have imagined that the outcome of Seseira would

318
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,520
 be in a woman's hand other than God?

319
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,640
 And who would have thought that this turn of events, which seems so unpredictable and

320
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,960
 impossible to happen.

321
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,100
 And that's the point that I wanted to get is that when we look towards God for the victorious

322
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:22,640
 battle, he will open the skies like he did for the Israelites, just for you.

323
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,000
 And he's going to have a chain of events that doesn't even make sense.

324
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,480
 And it's impossible.

325
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,040
 How would a female kill an assassin, a general?

326
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,960
 That's impossible.

327
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,320
 And yet she just took out some random tools and completed the job.

328
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:45,280
 So I just wanted to say that God loves us and he wants to help us with every single

329
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,680
 situation.

330
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:52,880
 And if we too will fight alongside with God, and if we will partner with him, putting our

331
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,080
 faith in him, exercising our faith muscles, and if we will take on the part that we are

332
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:06,920
 responsible for, we will see God delivering us in our situations.

333
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:12,320
 Now those situations may not happen exactly the way that we have hoped or we'd like, but

334
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,820
 we do know that God is in charge.

335
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:22,240
 And if he is in charge, he's able to bring us to an outcome that is for us and not against

336
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
 us.

337
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
 And so what does that mean for us today?

338
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,880
 Well, if we want to train up our faith muscles, we can start off by remember what Deborah

339
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
 did.

340
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,040
 She did good.

341
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,560
 And when she did good, she saw God and she got more faith.

342
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:43,640
 And so we can just read a passage from the Bible each day or even a verse and we'll say,

343
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,360
 you know what, Father, I'm willing to follow that passage.

344
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,080
 I'm willing to live that out today.

345
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:56,060
 If it says, forgive your enemy, and I have someone I really hate from work, I'm willing

346
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,640
 to do that.

347
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,320
 And if you say to forgive, and I'm fighting with my spouse, I'm willing to reconcile that

348
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,640
 day and that moment.

349
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,480
 And the more we do it, the more faith we build up.

350
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,680
 And so when things happen, like maybe we're facing coronavirus now and we're very nervous

351
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,160
 about it, or maybe you're looking for a job now and you look out, you're like, this is

352
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,120
 the hardest time to find a job.

353
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,800
 What shall I do?

354
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,960
 And in those moments, if we also act on it, take on our responsibilities, maybe we'll

355
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,160
 send out a resume every day.

356
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,480
 Maybe we'll even write a unique cover letter for each one.

357
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,680
 Or maybe for those of us who want to protect ourselves from the virus, then we're going

358
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,720
 to take as much precautions as we can.

359
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,080
 And this is a time where when we take on the responsibilities and we do our best, we're

360
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,720
 going to see God fighting for us.

361
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,920
 So friends today, I just wanted to encourage you because I've had so many instances where

362
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,080
 God and I partnered together, and again and again, He delivered me.

363
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:14,160
 And I just want to say that He's no longer a God that's far away that I can't reach.

364
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:21,320
 Through all these things that God and I have been together, actually, He's very, very close.

365
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:28,440
 He's so close to me that in each of my day, I can tell Him my struggles and He would guide

366
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,720
 me to do what is good, what is good for me.

367
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,440
 And so I just wanted to encourage you, if you take nothing away today, that if there's

368
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,040
 one thing that can build your faith muscle, and that would be read a passage a day and

369
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:53,160
 act on it, build your faith so that when that faith grows to be so big that you're able

370
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,980
 to believe in God's Word in whatever circumstances that you have.

371
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:04,200
 Maybe the circumstances that you're facing is as big as the 900 chariots of iron.

372
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:10,000
 And maybe that thing has been with you for over 20 years and you can't seem to get rid

373
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 of that problem.

374
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,720
 But you know what?

375
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,900
 Our God is much more powerful than that.

376
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,740
 He can take care of all those things.

377
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,240
 He can open up the skies for you.

378
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,380
 And He's willing to have this unexpected chain of events just to help you.

379
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,520
 So friends, really want to encourage you that we'll take faith in Him.

380
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:39,560
 So let us pray together for the God of the universe, our friend, to help us.

381
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:46,880
 Dear Heavenly Father, just want to thank you for being a God that never forsakes us.

382
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,920
 Even when we did not follow your ways, Father, you were compassionate and you would find

383
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,520
 ways to reach out to us again.

384
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,400
 You would give people like Deborah, you would give the Bible to us, you would give friends

385
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:10,360
 and church to bring us back so that even if we fell away from you, Father, that you would

386
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,980
 bring us back.

387
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,760
 And so Father, today we just pray that you would help us to build our faith muscle so

388
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:23,600
 that we have so much faith in you that whenever we're faced with crisis and troubles in our

389
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,440
 lives, that we will not look onto those trouble, but we'll look onto you, God, and say that

390
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,040
 you're always our help, you're always our friend.

391
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,920
 Father, help us so that we can partner with you.

392
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,960
 We just can't wait to see the works that you will do for us.

393
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
 Thank you, Father.

394
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,960
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

395
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,520
 Amen.

396
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
