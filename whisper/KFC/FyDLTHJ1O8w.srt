 - So a big welcome to those of you

221
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,720
 who may have joined us since the service started.

222
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,680
 Welcome to KFC Online.

223
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,880
 It's great to have you with us.

224
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,960
 And we haven't much in terms of notices tonight,

225
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,960
 but what we can tell you is that next Saturday the 24th,

226
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,480
 we will also be online and live streaming.

227
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,640
 And obviously what we'll do is we'll keep you posted,

228
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,280
 we'll keep you in touch with developments here.

229
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,080
 Basically everything this week is happening online,

230
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,380
 whether it be Bridge or Summer College Program,

231
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,240
 and indeed our service next Saturday.

232
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,760
 Please stay safe, won't you?

233
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,720
 And now we're gonna pray for Hong Kong.

234
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,440
 And I'm gonna ask Pastor Johnny to come and to pray for us

235
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,760
 and to introduce Michelle.

236
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,640
 - Thank you, Pastor John.

237
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,040
 Let's take some time to just quiet our hearts

238
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,300
 and come before God and ask him for our help.

239
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:35,520
 That we could pray for our city and pray for Hong Kong.

240
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,660
 Lord, we come before you and we know

241
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,080
 that there is this third wave in Hong Kong right now,

242
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,220
 that the infections are getting worse and worse,

243
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:52,060
 but we believe that God, you are with us,

244
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,220
 that you are sovereign.

245
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,180
 Lord, we ask that you would be with the medical staff

246
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,120
 and the team in the hospitals,

247
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,300
 that you would give them wisdom

248
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,140
 to know how to take care of the patients,

249
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,860
 you'd give them energy,

250
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:09,360
 give them knowledge of the virus and how to help people.

251
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,540
 Lord, I pray that you give our leaders in this city

252
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,540
 wisdom to know how to contain it,

253
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,000
 the rules and the regulations that will follow

254
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,540
 to help slow the curve down.

255
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,020
 Lord, we pray for the people in this city, Father,

256
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,700
 that they would be able to, yeah,

257
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,500
 be vigilant to wash our hands and keep our masks on

258
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,980
 and stay at home so that we can prevent this virus

259
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,000
 from getting worse and worse.

260
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,460
 Lord, amongst, even though all these things are happening

261
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,260
 in the midst of this storm,

262
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,300
 we still want to praise you and worship you,

263
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,580
 that you are God over this virus,

264
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,020
 you're God over our city,

265
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,580
 you're God over our hearts.

266
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,140
 And we want to acknowledge that you are God, Father.

267
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,660
 And Lord, we want to pray for Michelle

268
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:05,500
 as she comes up and speaks your word.

269
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,020
 Lord, empower her through the Holy Spirit.

270
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,580
 Bless her that the words that comes out

271
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,240
 will not go back void, Father, according to your word.

272
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,420
 Bless us, Lord, tonight as we listen to your word

273
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,740
 in Christ's name we pray, amen.

274
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:32,260
 - Good evening, everyone.

275
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,660
 Good evening, everyone.

276
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,700
 It's so glad, I'm so glad to be here

277
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,200
 to be speaking with you tonight.

278
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,080
 Now, I just want to show you this.

279
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,700
 I was gonna wear this tonight

280
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,700
 when you were all here to prevent the virus from spreading,

281
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,180
 but apparently you are now one screen away,

282
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,040
 so this will not be needed.

283
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,020
 I will just put this on the side.

284
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:01,640
 This is a situation where we're least expected,

285
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,820
 but we're glad that everybody is taking precautions.

286
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,020
 So I'm really glad tonight to be speaking with you

287
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,140
 on a message on how we can partner with God.

288
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,700
 Now, I don't know about you,

289
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,580
 but I've been facing problems every now and then,

290
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,300
 and I think it's just part of life

291
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,340
 that we have problems and troubles.

292
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,340
 But the thing is, how is it that we can partner with God

293
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,100
 so that he can help us in those situations?

294
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,760
 And for some of us, we might be going through a hard time

295
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,540
 because we have a relationship problem,

296
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,820
 or we might not be able to find a job,

297
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,660
 and we're having a financial problem.

298
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,820
 And for other people,

299
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,440
 we might be having problems in our family,

300
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,900
 and every now and then we might come into a crisis,

301
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,740
 and we just want to call out to God.

302
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,900
 But how is it that we can work with God

303
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,080
 so that God can work through us

304
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,920
 and that we can see his miracles?

305
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,960
 So today, we're gonna find out the secrets

306
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,300
 on how to do that.

307
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,140
 Now, we're gonna be studying Judges,

308
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,300
 chapter four and chapter five.

309
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,620
 Now, chapter four and five,

310
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,740
 they're actually telling the same story,

311
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,500
 except in chapter four, it's a narration.

312
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,200
 So it tells us a victorious battle

313
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,360
 that God has fought for the people of Israelites.

314
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,600
 Now, chapter five is where Deborah, the judge at that time,

315
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,620
 sings a song of victory

316
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,200
 because of this great battle that God has performed.

317
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,040
 So today, we're gonna look at both of them

318
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,520
 so that we can draw the details from both chapters

319
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,840
 and get the full picture.

320
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,280
 Now, so it all started in chapter four,

321
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:43,740
 where we find that Israelites, again,

322
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,640
 the people there were doing things

323
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,120
 that were evil in the sight of the Lord.

324
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,360
 And so the Lord gave them over to their enemies,

325
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,320
 the Canaanites.

326
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,340
 And now there was a king called King Jabin,

327
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,280
 and he lives, now I think I'm gonna try to use this,

328
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,520
 he lives right here at Hazar, okay?

329
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,760
 He lives very north.

330
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,000
 And now he has a commander, a military commander.

331
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,800
 His name is Seseira,

332
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,480
 and he lives right here in Haroshi Hagumi.

333
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,980
 And so what we find is that they are powerful

334
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,360
 because they have 900 chariots of iron

335
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,220
 and a very, very great army.

336
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,520
 Now, the Israelites,

337
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,900
 because the Lord has given them over to their enemies,

338
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,560
 has been oppressed by them for over 20 years now.

339
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,680
 And so there were cruelties and they were oppressed

340
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,440
 in such a way that the roads all along here,

341
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,920
 they were robbers and that people would just take plunders

342
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,120
 from the Israelites.

343
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,080
 And at the same time, the villages were no more,

344
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,520
 meaning that they were unwalled villages

345
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,920
 and people had no crops and had no agriculture at all.

346
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,760
 So that was a time of great oppression.

347
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,600
 And what we find is that God has Deborah being the judge,

348
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,600
 and she sits here, there is a palm tree named after her.

349
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,680
 It's called the Palm of Deborah.

350
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,200
 And it actually is situated between Bethel and Ramah.

351
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,960
 We're gonna find that these will actually come into play

352
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,980
 where the geographic of things are.

353
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,320
 So we're just gonna learn a little bit

354
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,480
 about where everything's happening.

355
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,360
 So now in this situation,

356
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,800
 we find that for some reason, a woman was the judge.

357
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:34,320
 And so she calls out to the Israelites military commander,

358
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,880
 and his name is right here.

359
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,800
 So what is it that we, so Deborah here,

360
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,200
 she calls out and she says,

361
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,240
 "Barak, you are our military commander, come.

362
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,400
 "Come because I have a word that I need to tell you."

363
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,760
 And so let's read it together.

364
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,920
 Here it says, "She sent and summoned Barak,

365
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,920
 "the son of Abinoam, and from Kadesh, Naphtali,

366
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,140
 "and said to him,

367
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:08,640
 "Has not the Lord, the God of Israel, commanded you?

368
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,720
 "Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor,

369
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,280
 "taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali

370
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,000
 "and the people of Zebulun.

371
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,140
 "And I will draw out Seseira, the general of Jabin's army,

372
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,460
 "to meet by the river Kishan

373
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,520
 "with his chariots and his troops.

374
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,960
 "I will give him into your hands."

375
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,180
 Now from these two verses,

376
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,400
 we can see that it was all God's plan

377
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,520
 to deliver the people of Israelites.

378
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,160
 And there was a great game plan.

379
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,760
 I mean, if we look at this,

380
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,080
 we see that this area is where the battlefield would be.

381
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,920
 And what we find is that Deborah tells him,

382
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,600
 "This is the game plan, okay?

383
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,680
 "God has it all written out for you.

384
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,960
 "All you need to do is carry it out

385
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,880
 "because God already said

386
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,080
 "that he will give your enemies into your hands."

387
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,760
 And this is what they were supposed to do.

388
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,320
 They were supposed to gather men from Naphtali and Zebulun

389
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,520
 and then travel to Kadesh.

390
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,820
 And then they're gonna go to Mount Tabor

391
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,400
 where they're gonna fight with Seseira,

392
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,040
 the general of the enemy,

393
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,640
 and they're gonna come here to this point

394
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,640
 where the Lord will give them over to the Israelites.

395
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,320
 Now this all sounds great, right?

396
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,000
 So now if you are Barak, what would you be thinking?

397
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
 "All right, I just got a word from God

398
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,040
 "and now I even got a confirmation from the judge, Deborah,

399
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,120
 "and she's also a prophetess.

400
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,160
 "So I think it's gonna be a sure win.

401
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,160
 "But somehow, Barak didn't really react like that.

402
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:51,160
 "So let's read and see how he reacted."

403
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,480
 And he said, "If you will go with me, I will go.

404
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,280
 "But if you will not go with me, I will not go."

405
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,680
 And she said, "I will surely go with you.

406
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,240
 "Nonetheless, the road on which you're going

407
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,060
 "will not lead you to glory,

408
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,560
 "for the Lord will sell Seseira into the hand of a woman."

409
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,760
 So Deborah rose and he went with Barak to Kadesh.

410
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,040
 Now what we find is that for some reason,

411
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,840
 even after the confirmation from God,

412
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,760
 it was not enough for Barak to take actions.

413
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,780
 Now there is something very, very different

414
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,520
 about Deborah and Barak, right?

415
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,220
 We can find a few differences.

416
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,520
 One is a male, one is a female,

417
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,960
 and one is a military general,

418
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,920
 while the other one is a prophet and a judge.

419
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,480
 And we find that there's also something very critical

420
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,440
 that sets them apart.

421
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,080
 And do you know what that is?

422
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,100
 I can't really hear you from across the screen,

423
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,800
 but I'll give you the answer.

424
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,780
 It is faith.

425
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,360
 It is faith that sets them apart.

426
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,960
 So I wanna bring us to a very first point,

427
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,600
 is that if we want to partner with God,

428
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,200
 if we want Him to be in our lives

429
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,160
 and help us with the situation that we're going through,

430
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,800
 we must have faith in God.

431
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,620
 Now as we said earlier,

432
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:16,480
 we found out that Barak actually realizes

433
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,240
 what God's word was,

434
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,000
 but he thinks that it's not good enough.

435
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 God's word alone for Barak was not good enough.

436
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,120
 He needed more,

437
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,720
 and even a confirmation was not enough for him.

438
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,520
 He needed even more.

439
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,920
 What did he need?

440
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:37,000
 He needed something that he could see with his eyes.

441
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,560
 He needed visual evidence.

442
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
 Now on the other hand,

443
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,540
 we see that Deborah believes in God

444
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,520
 and believes in His words alone.

445
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,600
 And she also risks her life,

446
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,280
 because when Barak says,

447
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,200
 "Will you go with me?"

448
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,060
 She said, "Okay, I'll go with you,

449
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,640
 "but you just won't get the glory."

450
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,920
 So she puts her life at risk for God's word.

451
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,920
 And also, she doesn't need physical evidence.

452
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,280
 Now what we notice is that there are these two people,

453
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,200
 one with faith, that's Deborah,

454
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,240
 Barak without,

455
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,440
 and we're asking ourselves,

456
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,440
 why is it that these two people

457
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,360
 under the same circumstances,

458
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,560
 they've been oppressed in the same ways,

459
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,080
 but one has faith and one doesn't?

460
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,800
 Because if we find out why,

461
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,160
 maybe it will also help us have faith.

462
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,560
 'Cause we hear people talk about

463
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,520
 have faith in God all the time,

464
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,560
 but how is it that we can do it?

465
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,920
 Now the Bible doesn't specify,

466
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,440
 but we can look at the clues and find out

467
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,560
 what makes Barak not courageous

468
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,000
 and what makes Deborah having all this faith.

469
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,400
 Now let's have a look,

470
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,280
 because in previous verses,

471
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,040
 we already saw that it said that the people of Israel,

472
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,760
 how did they do?

473
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,560
 They did evil in the eyes of the Lord.

474
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,920
 What else did they do?

475
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,080
 Because they did evil,

476
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,040
 the Lord sold them to their enemy, King Jabin.

477
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,320
 And when the new gods were chosen,

478
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,160
 war was at gates.

479
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,440
 So what is it that we realize is,

480
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,800
 Barak, who is part of the Israelite,

481
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,160
 has gone through this experience,

482
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,400
 where yeah, they prayed to God,

483
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,760
 but they were doing evil at that time.

484
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,560
 And because they did evil,

485
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,720
 God gave them into their enemies.

486
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,200
 And so they've been experiencing this God

487
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,040
 that's not fighting for them,

488
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,600
 but they've been experiencing a God

489
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,160
 that seemed to be distant and leaving them alone.

490
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,840
 And so what we find is that,

491
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,240
 Barak, having done evil,

492
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:56,560
 experiences a Lord that sells them to their enemies.

493
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,160
 And because of that,

494
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,120
 they have no faith in God and his words.

495
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,520
 Now on the contrary,

496
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:08,400
 we're gonna find that Deborah is not the same,

497
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,140
 even though they were under the same situation.

498
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,080
 But remember, Deborah,

499
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,480
 she is actually a prophetess and a judge.

500
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,640
 What that means was,

501
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,560
 she had access to the book of laws,

502
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,360
 and she would know what is it that God likes,

503
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,240
 and she would live by them.

504
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,680
 Now how do we know that she lived by them?

505
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,340
 Well, let's see,

506
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,800
 remember how Barak reacted?

507
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,840
 He actually said that,

508
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,640
 "If you go with me, I will go."

509
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,360
 What is that saying?

510
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,760
 That's saying that Deborah has such a good reputation

511
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,520
 of God's presence with her,

512
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,280
 that he's willing to even risk his life.

513
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,480
 So her reputation is telling us

514
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,400
 that she has been following God,

515
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,640
 and God's presence was apparent in her life.

516
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,880
 And at the same time,

517
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,780
 we also saw from scripture

518
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,880
 that it actually told us

519
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,560
 that she was able to judge the men of Israel,

520
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,960
 and men and people of Israel were actually going to her.

521
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,440
 So it means that because of the presence of God in her life,

522
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,440
 she was also able to teach people about who God was,

523
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,360
 and how they should live their life.

524
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,340
 So in here, we also see that in chapter five,

525
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,340
 it says, "I, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel."

526
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,880
 Now what do mothers do?

527
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,640
 Mothers discipline their children,

528
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,520
 they bring them to the right path.

529
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,100
 And so here we see that the reason that Deborah

530
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,240
 has so much faith is because she has been doing good,

531
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,200
 she has been doing things the way

532
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,320
 that God wanted the people to do.

533
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,160
 And not only that,

534
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,320
 she teaches other people to do that

535
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,860
 when she judged for them.

536
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,900
 And we also see because of that,

537
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,800
 the Lord has been with her,

538
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,760
 and it was apparent, so apparent,

539
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,160
 that people saw the presence of God in her life.

540
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:07,600
 And because of that, she has faith in God.

541
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,220
 And so faith is like a muscle that we have,

542
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,880
 that we can exercise.

543
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,320
 And if we are also like Deborah,

544
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,480
 if we choose to be like her,

545
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,800
 we can also exercise our faith muscle.

546
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:25,000
 And we can do that by following what God says.

547
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,520
 And whenever we follow what God says,

548
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,600
 and God's goodness comes into our life,

549
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,360
 we actually gain more faith.

550
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,000
 And if we store up so much faith,

551
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,720
 that when crisis come into our lives,

552
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,720
 we would have enough faith to just believe in God's word.

553
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,360
 And so from this we see the very first thing

554
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,120
 that we as partners of God need to do

555
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,780
 is to have faith through doing good.

556
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:58,760
 Now, another thing that we looked at is,

557
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,600
 we haven't looked at,

558
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,080
 we're going to look at now,

559
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,400
 is that as they were moving north,

560
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,240
 because Deborah was going with Barack,

561
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,480
 to north to have this battle.

562
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,040
 We realized that in chapter five,

563
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,160
 it actually tells us that she calls on

564
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,480
 to the different tribes.

565
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,480
 Because as she moves from here, Ifram,

566
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,040
 all the way up to where the battlefield is,

567
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,560
 that along the way,

568
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,960
 they were singing a song to let people know,

569
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,680
 come on out, come on out,

570
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,760
 because the Lord is fighting for us.

571
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,880
 We need you, come on out.

572
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,160
 But we realized that not all of them responded to God.

573
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,160
 And not all of them responded to Deborah and Barack's song.

574
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,680
 So I have highlighted for us

575
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:47,200
 that all of the one in Magneta,

576
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,520
 they're the ones that responded to their calling.

577
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,440
 And the ones in blue are the ones that didn't.

578
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,840
 And they were too busy tending their flocks,

579
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,200
 too busy fighting off other enemies,

580
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,800
 and or just simply for no reason.

581
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,320
 And the Bible tells us so.

582
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,280
 And so it brings us to our second point.

583
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,680
 If we want to partner with God,

584
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,640
 the very thing that we need to do

585
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:16,000
 is we need to also take on our responsibilities.

586
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,520
 Now we have responsibilities just like these tribes.

587
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,880
 When God is fighting for us,

588
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,160
 we have a responsibility to react.

589
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,160
 We have a responsibility to respond to his call of action.

590
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:33,680
 Now, I know that a lot of times,

591
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,240
 we just want to sit on our couch

592
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,440
 and wait for God to do things for us.

593
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,000
 But God is not here.

594
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,240
 He's not in the business of cultivating

595
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,360
 a lot of lazy Christians.

596
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,320
 But he is in the business of partnering with us.

597
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,200
 Think about this.

598
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,080
 I mean, God can just send a plague down,

599
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,020
 and immediately, all the enemies would be gone.

600
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,640
 Why spend so much time gathering people?

601
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,000
 And it's not even a lot, it's 10,000 people.

602
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,760
 So why is it that he's doing so much?

603
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,080
 It's because he wants our partnership.

604
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,320
 How easy it would be for him to just do that.

605
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,520
 Now we have a Cantonese saying that

606
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,720
 when you go to someone for dinner

607
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,280
 and you want to bring something,

608
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,840
 we usually bring a chicken or something

609
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,440
 for the dinner buffet, right?

610
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,280
 So there's a saying that someone will bring the chicken

611
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,100
 and I will bring the soy sauce, okay?

612
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,520
 Which means that this is pretty much what's happening.

613
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,480
 Even though this is a partnership that we have with God,

614
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,280
 but really, he's bringing the chicken.

615
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,760
 He's doing all the work,

616
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,480
 but he just wants us to participate, bring the soy sauce.

617
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,480
 And so when we partner with him,

618
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,880
 it's important that we take on our responsibilities.

619
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,880
 And if we do that, we're gonna see God acting out for us.

620
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,960
 And so this is a saying I really like,

621
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,960
 which is we can't do anything if God is not here,

622
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,880
 but God won't do anything if we're not here.

623
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,120
 Okay, I'm gonna say that again.

624
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:11,820
 We can't do anything if God is not here,

625
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,520
 but God won't do anything if we're not here,

626
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,440
 because God wants our partnership.

627
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,800
 This is a relationship that we have with him.

628
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:27,880
 And so the third thing that I wanna tell you

629
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,120
 is that while we partner with God,

630
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,920
 this is my favorite point, by the way.

631
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,840
 My favorite point is the third point,

632
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,920
 because I get to see the salvation of the Lord.

633
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,840
 This is the part where after we've put in our faith

634
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,320
 in what God said, and this is the part

635
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,880
 where we even took on our responsibilities

636
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,080
 and did what we were supposed to,

637
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,040
 God has the battle, and he's gonna deliver us,

638
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,720
 because he knew how the ending would be

639
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,140
 even before anything happened.

640
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,520
 So the third part for us to really partner with God

641
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,120
 is just to see how he's gonna save us,

642
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,960
 and it's so awesome to watch that.

643
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,600
 And in this situation where the tribes were fighting

644
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,940
 at the River of Kishon, what we find

645
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:18,500
 is that all of a sudden, even though

646
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,200
 the River of Kishon in that time of the year

647
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,820
 was a small stream, okay, but all of a sudden,

648
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:29,260
 there was a cloudburst in a month

649
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,940
 that rain was unheard of, and all of a sudden,

650
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,860
 the heaven rained, and what we find

651
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,620
 is that in this verse we see,

652
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,500
 from heaven, the stars fought.

653
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,680
 From their courses, they fought against Cicera.

654
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,640
 The torrent Kishon swept them away.

655
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,640
 The ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon,

656
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,020
 marching on my soul.

657
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,380
 And so what we see here is that

658
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,060
 the Lord actually opened up the sky,

659
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,260
 and it started to rain in a season

660
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,660
 that rain was impossible, and not only

661
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,860
 like a few drops of rain, it was a torrent.

662
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:13,300
 It was enough that the ground that the chariots were on

663
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,780
 became muddy, and that the wheels

664
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,000
 were all stuck in the mud, and it can no longer go.

665
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,580
 And so the Israelites were able to take the lives

666
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,500
 of those army and their enemies.

667
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,220
 And so what we find here is that God

668
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,500
 is here to fight for us, because he loves us,

669
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,260
 and in any situation, he wants to be a part of our lives.

670
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,860
 He wants to take care of our problems,

671
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,440
 but it's not all the time that we

672
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,000
 are actually partnering with him.

673
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,900
 A lot of times, we're just on our own.

674
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,380
 So I just want to share a quick story

675
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:52,260
 about an event that happened last week.

676
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,540
 So last week, I was told, at least my mom tells me,

677
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,660
 that there's some family businesses

678
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,020
 that I need to take care of.

679
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,460
 And I was like, okay, well, this is not something

680
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,220
 that I really am looking forward to.

681
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,560
 The reason being is because the task required

682
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,380
 that I would need to talk to much older men,

683
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,940
 and they were a lot craftier than I was.

684
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,300
 And I was definitely not looking forward to it.

685
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,380
 And so I actually sat down,

686
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,980
 'cause I have two sisters, and they're not in Hong Kong,

687
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,940
 and so it's just me and my mom, all females.

688
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,420
 And so I was thinking to myself,

689
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,440
 all right, what kind of guy friends do I have?

690
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,140
 Maybe I'll ask that person to help.

691
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,100
 Nope, maybe that person, nope.

692
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,980
 And so I went through a list of people,

693
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,500
 and I realized they didn't quite fit,

694
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:42,620
 as in it wasn't quite right for them to help me.

695
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:48,540
 And so I suddenly remembered these two chapters,

696
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,300
 because I was also preparing for this sermon.

697
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,880
 And I asked myself, Michelle,

698
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,700
 what is it that you're depending on?

699
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,600
 Are you depending on human beings, people?

700
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,300
 Are you depending on people

701
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:07,660
 who are more skillful than you are?

702
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,680
 Or are you gonna depend on God and God alone?

703
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,620
 And I just remembered, I said, yes,

704
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,700
 of course, God and God alone.

705
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,860
 And suddenly I just started to remember

706
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,100
 that God loves me so much.

707
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:23,500
 Not that I forgot, but it was a very deliberate thought

708
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:27,780
 that God loves me so much that he's gonna provide for me.

709
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,340
 He's gonna open the ways for me.

710
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,980
 And so the next day, even though I was a little bit scared,

711
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:37,380
 I texted the people that I needed to talk to,

712
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,220
 and 'cause I thought I need to fulfill my responsibility.

713
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:46,220
 I need to do, I need to act in a faithful way

714
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,280
 after I know and have faith in God.

715
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,340
 I still needed to do something.

716
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,480
 So I texted them and we had a chance to meet up

717
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,140
 and negotiated on some terms.

718
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,200
 And surprisingly, I have to say surprisingly,

719
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,060
 that God delivered.

720
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,260
 He delivered just like the way he delivered

721
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,820
 the Israelites because they were supposed to be

722
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,820
 these old fox, but then they were like sheep somehow.

723
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,540
 And at the same time, they agreed to pretty much

724
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,380
 all the terms that I wanted to,

725
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,700
 which is very, very surprising for me.

726
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:29,820
 So you see, the story actually didn't end here

727
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,300
 for the Israelites, but I wanted to use my story

728
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,740
 to share with you that when we put our faith there,

729
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,740
 when we also act on it, that God will open doors

730
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,200
 in a way that we least expected.

731
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,140
 And when I say least expected,

732
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,660
 want us to continue on the story where we see

733
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,860
 that Seseira was actually one of the only men

734
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,520
 that got away from that event,

735
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,980
 when God gave them a victorious battle.

736
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,020
 And he was the only one that ran away

737
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,100
 and he went to a tent.

738
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,700
 And this tent was owned by a lady called Jael.

739
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,140
 Now Jael was actually supposed to be a family ally

740
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,140
 of the Kenyanites, but God used her in a way

741
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:25,060
 that helped the Israelites to get rid of this general.

742
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,340
 Now, how did he do it?

743
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,880
 So he asked, he asked Jael if he could take cover

744
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,560
 in refuge in her tent.

745
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,480
 And so she says, yes, and she says,

746
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,880
 "Turn around so I can cover you with this rug."

747
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,160
 And then he asked, "Could I have some water?"

748
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,320
 And she says, "Yes, have some milk."

749
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,200
 They were curdled milk.

750
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,960
 And then he says, "If anyone asks for me,

751
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,400
 "just say that there's no one here."

752
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,920
 And she's like, okay.

753
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,680
 So she goes to her toolbox and she actually takes out

754
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,680
 a peg and also a hammer.

755
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,960
 Because in those days, women actually put up

756
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,720
 and they took down tents.

757
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,640
 So she had these tools in her female toolbox.

758
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,260
 And so she took it over and actually while he was sleeping,

759
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,600
 she has assassinated him.

760
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:22,320
 And so what we find is that who would have imagined

761
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,520
 that the outcome of Seseira would be

762
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,820
 in a woman's hand other than God?

763
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:34,560
 And who would have thought that this turn of events,

764
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,960
 which seems so unpredictable and impossible to happen.

765
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,680
 And that's the point that I wanted to get,

766
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,680
 is that when we look towards God for the victorious battle,

767
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,600
 he will open the skies like he did for the Israelites,

768
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,000
 just for you.

769
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,960
 And he's gonna have a chain of events

770
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,800
 that doesn't even make sense and it's impossible.

771
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,320
 How would a female kill an assassin, a general?

772
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,320
 That's impossible.

773
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,400
 And yet she just took out some random tools

774
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,620
 and completed the job.

775
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:14,320
 So I just wanted to say that God loves us

776
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,800
 and he wants to help us with every single situation.

777
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,840
 And if we too will fight alongside with God,

778
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,880
 and if we will partner with him,

779
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:28,880
 putting our faith in him, exercising our faith muscles,

780
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,480
 and if we will take on the part that we are responsible for,

781
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,320
 we will see God delivering us in our situations.

782
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,300
 Now, those situations may not happen

783
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,620
 exactly the way that we have hoped or we'd like,

784
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:46,080
 but we do know that God is in charge.

785
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,600
 And if he is in charge, he's able to bring us

786
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,240
 to an outcome that is for us and not against us.

787
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,360
 And so what does that mean for us today?

788
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,160
 Well, if we wanna train up our faith muscles,

789
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,840
 we can start off by remember what Deborah did.

790
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,440
 She did good.

791
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,800
 And when she did good, she saw God and she got more faith.

792
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,840
 And so we can just read a passage from the Bible each day

793
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,920
 or even a verse and we'll say, you know what?

794
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,880
 Father, I'm willing to follow that passage.

795
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,440
 I'm willing to live that out today.

796
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,480
 If it says, forgive your enemy,

797
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,000
 and I have someone I really hate from work,

798
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,020
 I'm willing to do that.

799
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:32,880
 And if you say to forgive, and I'm fighting with my spouse,

800
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,020
 I'm willing to reconcile that day and that moment.

801
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,880
 And the more we do it, the more faith we build up.

802
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,560
 And so when things happen,

803
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,200
 like maybe we're facing coronavirus now

804
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,080
 and we're very nervous about it,

805
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,760
 or maybe you're looking for a job now and you look out,

806
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,520
 you're like, this is the hardest time to find a job.

807
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,200
 What shall I do?

808
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,300
 And in those moments, if we also act on it,

809
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,020
 take on our responsibilities,

810
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,440
 maybe we'll send out a resume every day.

811
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,820
 Maybe we'll even write a unique cover letter for each one.

812
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:12,320
 Or maybe for those of us who want to protect ourselves

813
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:14,720
 from the virus, then we're gonna take

814
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,120
 as much precautions as we can.

815
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,920
 And this is a time where when we take on the responsibilities

816
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,020
 and we do our best, we're gonna see God fighting for us.

817
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,560
 So friends today, I just wanted to encourage you

818
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,160
 because I've had so many instances

819
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,560
 where God and I partnered together.

820
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,480
 And again and again, he delivered me.

821
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,920
 And I just wanted to say that he's no longer a God

822
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,480
 that's far away that I can't reach.

823
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:50,160
 Through all these things that God and I have been together,

824
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,680
 actually, he's very, very close.

825
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:56,760
 He's so close to me that in each of my day,

826
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,440
 I can tell him my struggles and he would guide me

827
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,120
 to do what is good, what is good for me.

828
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,880
 And so I just wanted to encourage you.

829
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,460
 If you took nothing away today,

830
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,000
 that if there's one thing that can build your faith muscle,

831
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,000
 and that would be read a passage a day and act on it.

832
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,960
 Build your faith so that when that faith grows to be so big,

833
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,460
 that you're able to believe in God's word

834
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:29,200
 in whatever circumstances that you have.

835
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,760
 Maybe the circumstances that you're facing

836
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,560
 is as big as the 900 chariots of iron.

837
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,560
 And maybe that thing has been with you for over 20 years

838
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,200
 and you can't seem to get rid of that problem.

839
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,440
 But you know what?

840
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,360
 Our God is much more powerful than that.

841
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,240
 He can take care of all those things.

842
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,680
 He can open up the skies for you.

843
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,120
 And he's willing to have this unexpected chain of events

844
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,380
 just to help you.

845
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,160
 So friends, really want to encourage you

846
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,960
 that we'll take faith in him.

847
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,000
 So let us pray together for the God of the universe,

848
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,440
 our friend to help us.

849
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,440
 - Dear Heavenly Father, just want to thank you

850
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,120
 for being a God that never forsakes us.

851
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:22,480
 Even when we did not follow your ways, Father,

852
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,800
 you were compassionate and you would find ways

853
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,960
 to reach out to us again.

854
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,580
 You would give people like Deborah,

855
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:32,600
 you would give the Bible to us.

856
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,360
 You would give friends and church to bring us back

857
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,880
 so that even if we fell away from you, Father,

858
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,400
 that you would bring us back.

859
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,680
 And so Father, today we just pray that you would help us

860
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,960
 to build our faith muscle so that we have so much faith

861
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,960
 in you that whenever we're faced with crisis and troubles

862
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,800
 in our lives, that we will not look onto those trouble,

863
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,960
 but we'll look onto you, God, and say that

864
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,960
 you're always our help, you're always our friend.

865
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,040
 Father, help us so that we can partner with you.

866
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,600
 We just can't wait to see the works

867
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,320
 that you will do for us.

868
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,480
 Thank you, Father.

869
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,220
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

870
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:24,880
 - Let's respond in song.

871
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,820
 Whom shall I fear?

872
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:35,020
 You hear me.

873
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:39,340
 You hear me when I call.

874
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:42,780
 You are my morning song.

875
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,060
 Though darkness fills the night,

876
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:48,820
 it cannot hide the light.

877
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:53,220
 Whom shall I fear?

878
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:58,740
 You crush the enemy

879
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:02,500
 underneath my feet.

880
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,740
 You are my sword and shield.

881
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,780
 Though troubles linger still,

882
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,820
 whom shall I fear?

883
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:18,980
 I know who goes before me.

884
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:22,300
 I know who stands behind.

885
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:25,780
 The God of angel armies

886
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,180
 is always by my side.

887
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,620
 The one who reigns forever,

888
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:36,060
 he is a friend of mine.

889
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,540
 The God of angel armies

890
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,180
 is always by my side.

891
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:47,220
 My strength.

892
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:52,100
 My strength is in your name,

893
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,460
 for you alone can save.

894
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,780
 You will deliver me.

895
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,060
 Yours is the victory.

896
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:05,940
 Whom shall I fear?

897
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:11,780
 Whom shall I fear?

898
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:18,900
 I know who goes before me.

899
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,300
 I know who stands behind.

900
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,660
 The God of angel armies

901
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:29,020
 is always by my side.

902
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,340
 The one who reigns forever,

903
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,700
 he is a friend of mine.

904
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:39,060
 The God of angel armies

905
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,540
 is always by my side.

906
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:48,980
 And nothing formed against me shall stand,

907
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:55,460
 'cause you hold the whole world in your hand.

908
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,460
 I'm holding on to your promises.

909
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,460
 You are faithful.

910
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,460
 You are faithful.

911
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:14,460
 And nothing formed against me shall stand,

912
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:21,460
 'cause you hold the whole world in your hand.

913
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:28,460
 I'm holding on to your promises.

914
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,460
 You are faithful.

915
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,460
 You are faithful.

916
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,460
 You are faithful.

917
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:47,460
 I know who goes before me.

918
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:50,460
 I know who stands behind.

919
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,460
 The God of angel armies

920
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,460
 is always by my side.

921
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,460
 The one who reigns forever,

922
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,460
 he is a friend of mine.

923
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:08,460
 The God of angel armies

924
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:11,460
 is always by my side.

925
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,460
 I know who goes before me.

926
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:18,460
 I know who stands behind.

927
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:22,460
 The God of angel armies

928
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:25,460
 is always by my side.

929
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:28,460
 The one who reigns forever,

930
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,460
 he is a friend of mine.

931
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,460
 The God of angel armies

932
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,460
 is always by my side.

933
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,460
 The God of angel armies

934
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:47,460
 is always by my side.

935
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:52,460
 Let's just take a few moments

936
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,460
 as we draw our service to a close.

937
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,460
 We've sung those words,

938
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:01,460
 "I know who goes before me.

939
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,460
 I know who stands behind.

940
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,460
 The God of angel armies

941
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,460
 is always by my side."

942
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,460
 As Pastor Michelle told us,

943
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:18,460
 it's a partnership.

944
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:22,460
 I just sense as if God is reaching out

945
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,460
 his hand to you,

946
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:29,460
 as it were beyond the computer screen.

947
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,460
 He's saying to you now,

948
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:38,460
 "Will you take my hand?

949
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,460
 Will you come in partnership with me?"

950
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:48,460
 I don't know what you're going through in your life,

951
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:52,460
 but what I do know,

952
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:56,460
 if you would just reach out your hand tonight

953
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:00,460
 and take the hand of the one

954
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:04,460
 who is the God of angel armies,

955
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:10,460
 he is faithful.

956
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:14,460
 He will be faithful to you as he was to Deborah

957
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:17,460
 and the Israelites.

958
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,460
 So let's pray together as we close the service.

959
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:29,460
 Father, I thank you for meeting us tonight.

960
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:35,460
 Lord, meeting us in that difficult situation.

961
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:39,460
 Meeting us in the things that we have to face.

962
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:45,460
 Father, would you take my hand?

963
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:53,460
 Would you lead me to your side?

964
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:59,460
 May I know your presence with me

965
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,460
 tonight and always.

966
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,460
 May the blessing of God Almighty

967
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:15,460
 Father, Son, and Holy Spirit

968
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:19,460
 be upon us and our loved ones

969
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:26,460
 this night and for always.

970
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:30,460
 My friends, thank you for joining us tonight.

971
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,460
 God bless you.

972
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,460
 Just remember this week,

973
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,460
 everything will be online,

974
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:43,460
 whether it be Klans or Bridge or SCP.

975
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:48,460
 And next Saturday, we'll be back live streaming here again.

976
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:53,460
 Please join us as we start to look at the story of Gideon together.

977
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,460
 God bless you.

978
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,460
 Stay safe.
