[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   Hello everyone, good to see you all. Very, very good to see you. Hey, this is my first
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.280]   time sharing over Zoom like this as well. I think one of the things I would really look
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.520]   forward to is to be able to actually share and actually see faces rather than preaching
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.280]   into a camera or an empty hall. Now I get to see Vincent's good looking face. I only
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.920]   wish I got to see him on his sofa, but this is good enough for me. Hey Vincent, hey everyone,
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.880]   it's really good to see you all. I'm trying to try and resist the temptation to keep sliding
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.960]   through all the screens to see who's paying attention or who's not, but I want to try
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.280]   and resist that. Hey, we're going to go through Judges and it's a strange book. It's a strange
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.680]   book and I shared this last time. It's full of these pretty moronic people who God uses
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.440]   to somehow lead and deliver the Israelites. We've had some of the big names. We've had
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.240]   Deborah, we've had Gideon, Mark. Thank you so much for your sharing. It's so good to
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.400]   be able to hear from other people in our church and that's been a real encouragement to me
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.680]   and to the Pastoral team as well. We've been going through all these different Judges and
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.760]   now we come across one who maybe we haven't heard that much of and because there's a reason
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.400]   for it. He is a real idiot. He is just one stupid man. In fact, as we look through the
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.400]   Judges chapter 9, we'll see that there really isn't much that we can learn from him. If
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.360]   anything, we have to only learn from what he does and make sure that we don't do it
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.120]   and that is it. This guy is called Abimelech. If you want to turn with me to Judges chapter
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.640]   9, it's a very long chapter. There's 57 verses, so don't worry, I'm not going to troll us
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.280]   through all of this just because we have an unlimited Zoom account. What I do want to
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.480]   do is as we share this story is really ask God to really speak to us and see how we can
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.640]   apply it right now. So we've had Ahab, we've had Deborah, we've had Gideon and now we have
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:10.040]   Gideon's son. Gideon actually is one of the more famous Judges, I would say, and he's
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.000]   an interesting one, right, because he really lacked confidence and then God really assured
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.560]   him and really came through him and then God used this person who wasn't the most confident
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.640]   to end up really delivering the Israelites from the Midianites in some of these great
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.120]   battles that we've heard in the last few weeks. And Gideon himself was, most would say, a
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.880]   humble kind of guy. But then it is interesting because in some ways it is a false sense of
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.760]   humility that we see. In Judges chapter 8, before we're introduced to Gideon's son Abimelech,
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.440]   Gideon wins this big battle. He comes back and the Israelites are like, "We want you
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.920]   to be our king. Seriously, we want you to rule over us, Great Gideon." And Gideon's
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.800]   like, "Oh, no, no, no, I don't want to rule over you. But what I do want you to do is
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.840]   give me all your gold and I'm going to make a jacket out of it and it's going to look
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.240]   pretty cool. I want to act like a king, but I don't want the responsibilities." In some
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.240]   ways, yes, it's humility, but it's probably a false sense of humility. And we sense that
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:14.560]   even more in how he names his son. His son Abimelech means, "My father is king." So
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.120]   even though Gideon turned down kingship for the Israelites in some subtle, stealth kind
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.360]   of way, he still slips it in there that his son's father himself is king. And that false
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:33.000]   humility, almost that false sense of identity and where he's getting his validation from
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.600]   seeps into the next generation, seeps into what his son then does. And see, Abimelech
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.480]   is his son, but he's only really one of 71. Abimelech has 70 brothers and Abimelech is
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.600]   really just a bad egg. And I want to tell you a little bit about him. I'm going to run
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.760]   through the story about Abimelech from the moment he tries to become king to unfortunately
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.880]   the moment he dies. This is disclaimer. If you don't know about Abimelech, unfortunately,
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.760]   this is not breaking bad. This is not going from bad to being a good. There is no good
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.400]   ending to this story. It's a bad ending. Okay. So just putting that one out there. And it
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.040]   starts off with Abimelech, one of 71 sons, actually his mother was Gideon's slave. So
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.680]   you could say that he was an illegitimate one. Illegitimate. So he goes to his mom's
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:30.720]   town. And then from there, he goes to find his mom and all her friends and all her family.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.760]   And what does he do? He starts fundraising. He starts going to all these people who know
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.280]   him and know his mom and say, Hey, look, do you really want to be ruled by these 70 guys?
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.480]   Is it even possible to be ruled by 70? Isn't it much more efficient if you just get ruled
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.080]   by me? If you are just ruled by me, how about you guys make me king? Seriously, I would
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.600]   be so much better. So clearly Abimelech is good with his words. He's know what he's doing.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.640]   He's manipulative. He's scheming. He's ambitious. And so he goes to these people, he fundraise
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.840]   and what do they do? They give him money. People of Shechem there. Shechem is a Canaanite
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.520]   town actually. Remember, the Israelites were supposed to go into Canaan and drive everyone
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.320]   out. They did not. So then you have all these Canaanites and all these different groups
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.120]   of people living within this promised land. And so Shechem was a town that was full of
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.720]   Canaanite people and they did worship other gods. And when they heard about Abimelech's
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.640]   fundraising speech, they were like, yeah, sure. We'll have you rule over us. We'll give
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.280]   you your money. So he gets all this money and what does he do with it? He then in 9
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   verse 4 says he goes out and he recruits worthless and reckless fellows. So what he does is he
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.600]   goes out with 70 pieces of silver, verse 4, and he hires worthless and reckless fellows
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.480]   who then follow him. Him with this band of gangsters then take all the brothers, round
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:59.960]   up all the 70 brothers, take them onto one stone and they kill them all apart from one.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.760]   One guy manages to escape and his name is Jotham. Verse 5 says Jotham manages to escape.
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.120]   Abimelech having killed all his brothers and basically all the competition assumes the
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.000]   role of king in this small town of Shechem. It's not the whole of Israel. It's not the
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.400]   whole of Canaan. It's just a small town. He seems quite happy with himself. He has declared
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   himself king. From there, Jotham, the brother that escapes, he hears about this and he comes
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.840]   back out and he tells this parable. He tells this parable to the people of Shechem and
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.320]   it's a parable about trees. We won't go into this today but what he's really saying is
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.240]   this. The story is, he's like, people of Shechem, have a serious think about what you're doing
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:46.800]   here as you make this person your king. You need to ask yourselves, are you doing this
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.560]   with the right intentions? Are you picking someone who is a good leader? Remember what
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.400]   my dad Gideon did for you all. How God and Gideon delivered all of us. Do you really
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.840]   want to act in such bad faith to appoint this guy to be your king? Have a think about this.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.600]   Seriously, have a think. If you really think he's the right one, well then you've made
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.840]   your choice and you will go with it. He gives this little speech, this parable and then
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:19.920]   he goes into hiding. He goes into hiding for three years. Three years in hiding, all the
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.720]   while hearing that this half brother of his is now ruling over his town. You see, what
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.080]   God is doing, God is allowing time to pass. It's interesting because we're often asking,
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.720]   I don't know about you, we're looking around the world now and we're looking at the leaders
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.160]   that we have in this world and we're thinking, oh my goodness, what is happening here? What
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:45.520]   is happening here? Why is God allowing these people to be appointed as leaders? No country
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.720]   is being named right here, right now, but what is God doing? And then what we see then
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.080]   is that actually God is above it all and actually he allows certain things to happen for his
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.200]   reason and imagine feeling how Jotham felt at that moment. He's given this parable, he
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.560]   knows he's right because he knows Abimelech is in the wrong, yet God still chooses to
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:11.640]   wait three years. But after that, the divine retribution kicks in. Verse 24 is when God
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.800]   says after the three years, he then starts his plan of removing Abimelech. And right
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:23.440]   at the end of chapter nine, right at the very, very end, verse 57, "And God also made all
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.960]   the evil of the men of Shechem return on their heads and upon them came the curse of Jotham,
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.600]   the son of Jeroboam." Jeroboam being Gideon. And so we see here, God is in complete control,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.920]   even when there are bad leaders. And this is where we almost have to remind ourselves
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:46.000]   of this, to have faith in God's sovereignty, that he is in complete control. Even when
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   we see there are certain people in this world that have been allowed to be leaders of very
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.080]   important countries, yet somehow God is still in control. And you see what happens after
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.760]   this is, how does God start this process of removing Abimelech? You carry on into chapter
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:09.200]   nine, verse 22 onwards is the downfall of Abimelech. What happens is God sends an evil
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.160]   spirit, allows an evil spirit to basically place a wedge between Abimelech and the people
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:22.080]   of Shechem. So the very people that gave Abimelech money because of an evil spirit now turn against
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.040]   him. They're like, "You know what? We don't really want him anymore. It's been three years,
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.160]   we're done with him." So what do they do? They then go and try and find another guy
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:36.720]   to dethrone him. And this guy is, verse 26, they find Gael. Unfortunately, he fails. He
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:43.620]   fails. Abimelech knows what's happening and ends up ambushing him and basically running
[00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:50.740]   him out of town. At this point, Abimelech is angry. These are the people that gave him
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:56.440]   money and supported him and made him king and they've turned against him. So what happens
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.440]   here is he then starts to kill these people. So he goes into his own town and basically
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:08.160]   starts to destroy the city. And all the people, they try and find refuge in this tower. They
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.920]   try and find refuge in this tower. They all run up into this tower, a thousand of them,
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.880]   to try and run away from Abimelech and to protect themselves. Abimelech ends up basically
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:21.560]   setting fire to the whole tower, causing the whole thing to be destroyed and all the people
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:26.960]   inside to be killed. So Abimelech now is on some kind of power trip. He's angry that he's
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.200]   been betrayed and then he goes and destroys his own town. The town that he was supposed
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:38.560]   to be king of, he has completely destroyed. Not only that, something in him switched where
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:43.820]   before he was happy to rule just this small town for three years. After destroying his
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.840]   own town, he decides, that's it. I'm going to go and try and capture other towns. So
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.880]   he then moves into a neighboring town, Bebez, to try and capture that one. And this is unprecedented
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.480]   for him. Remember before he was happy just to rule his own little thing. So then because
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.440]   of that pride, because of that anger, he then goes into another town and he tries to capture
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:09.640]   that one. Again, he basically runs all the residents in that town up into their tower.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.800]   And what's he thinking? Look, that's a stupid idea guys. I just destroyed a thousand people
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.040]   in a tower in my own town. I'm going to do the same with you guys. I'm going to set you
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.940]   guys all on fire and you'll be done. But what he doesn't know is his pride ends up leading
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:30.140]   to his destruction because in that tower, one woman drops a really big heavy stone,
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:35.340]   a millstone, drops it down from the top of the tower and it so happens to hit Abimelech
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:41.420]   in the head and crushes his skull. But he doesn't quite die immediately. He knows that
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:47.380]   he's just had a millstone being crushed, dropped by a woman onto his head and he knows he's
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:53.420]   about to die. But then he goes to a soldier next to him and says, "Hey, draw your sword
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.860]   and you kill me because I don't want to be that guy that gets known to be killed by a
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:06.440]   woman." So then you can see still that pride that existed in Abimelech even to the very
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:14.180]   last breath. And that is the story of Abimelech. That's it. And you're just thinking, "Oh my
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:18.460]   goodness, why is this in the scriptures? This is just the most terrible story. There is
[00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:24.460]   not a single verse here that really is edifying or glorifying in any way. What is going on
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.740]   here?" And I thought that today as I'm sharing this passage to you over Zoom, I'm just thinking,
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:36.980]   you know what Abimelech did? He just gave us a crash course on bad leadership 101. Bad
[00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.940]   leadership 101. And of course, I think there are people in this world, current world leaders
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.860]   who could probably do the same for us right now. But Abimelech here is the one in the
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.460]   scriptures who's doing this for us. And I'm wanting to share a couple of points that I've
[00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:54.020]   observed about being a bad leader that Abimelech was and seeing how that can apply into our
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:13:01.700]   lives. And the first thing is this, Abimelech was power hungry. Power hungry. You see, he
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:07.300]   was one of 71 boys and he decided that he wanted all the power. He was ambitious, he
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:14.300]   was manipulative, he was scheming. The problem is this, true leaders earn the right to lead.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.500]   True leaders earn the right to lead. And you see, the thing is, at this point Israel had
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:23.340]   no king because Israel wasn't supposed to have a king. Israel's king was supposed to
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:30.700]   be who? God. God was supposed to be the one who was supposed to lead this nation. But
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.140]   you see, this is the thing that reminded me and really convicted me. As I look down on
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:40.420]   Abimelech, as I'm looking at him thinking, you, why are you, your life is just, you're
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:46.860]   incredibly stupid. But then I realized inside the heart of every person is this desire to
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:53.540]   be king, is this desire to be God. That we are all in some ways power hungry, at least
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:59.740]   I am. And you might think, well, I'm not that bad. I'm not as bad as Abimelech. And for
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.780]   me, I hope I'm not either. But then I'm thinking, you know what, maybe there are some aspects
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:10.380]   of my life where I am in desire, where I'm desiring to be God myself. Every time I try
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:16.500]   and take control of something in my life, every time I try to pursue my own ambitions,
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.420]   my own agenda, every time I feel as though I'm offended by someone or I've been slighted
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:26.100]   by someone and I want to take it into my own hands and I want to take control of the situation.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:31.860]   I want to assert authority in my own life over someone else. Maybe that's revealing
[00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:38.060]   that I have a desire to be God, that I have that same desire. And I think inside the heart
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:44.780]   of every person is that desire to be in control. I don't know about you. I don't know what
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:51.060]   areas of your life you feel that you are always wanting to make sure that everything is settled,
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:56.300]   everything is under control. And a lot of these feelings don't come from a bad place.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.140]   We're not trying to take over the world. We just want our own lives to be set in our own
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:08.660]   ways based on our own preferences. And I think in some ways that itself is us trying to wrestle
[00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:14.740]   away control from God. That is us not being willing to relinquish control and surrendering
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.780]   to God. Inside the heart of every person is that desire to be God. And the problem is
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:26.140]   this, that is the reason for the fall of mankind. That is what caused Adam and Eve to make that
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.820]   first mistake, wanting to feel that they are God, that they are the ones that know everything,
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:37.300]   they are in control. And so it really requires all of us, brothers and sisters, to ask ourselves,
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.700]   what areas of our lives do we think we are actually being power hungry, that we haven't
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:47.660]   actually surrendered to God? You know, we ask, the Psalmist asks in Psalm 139, "God,
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.340]   you have to search my heart and test my thoughts to see if there is any offensive way in me
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:57.540]   because I know my heart is deceitful. There are areas in my life that I know that I am
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:03.380]   refusing to relinquish control. I know right there I am wanting to be king. I am wanting
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:10.020]   to be God." You know, I took two weeks off recently and I watched an old film, an old
[00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:17.060]   favorite of mine called Gladiator, Gladiator by Russell Crowe. And Russell Crowe plays
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:24.020]   this mighty warrior who is in charge of the Roman Empire called Maximus. And there's a
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.900]   scene early on in the film, and I'm not afraid to give you spoilers, it's been like 20 years
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:34.500]   that you've had every chance to watch it. There's the scene where Caesar, the emperor,
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.740]   is about to die. So he's looking for someone to succeed him. And of course, he has his
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:45.020]   own son, but his own son is a little bit like a Bimelic. So he wants to give control to
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:51.740]   Maximus, Russell Crowe. And then Russell Crowe, so he tells Russell Crowe, he tells Maximus,
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:57.540]   "I want you to take over my empire." And Russell Crowe tells him, "No, it can't be me. I can't
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.780]   do it. I don't want to do it." And then Caesar tells him, "That's exactly the reason why
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:07.700]   you are the only one who can, who should, because you don't want that power. You don't
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:14.020]   want that control." In some ways, it's the same as a true leaders are not power hungry.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:18.900]   True leaders are not power hungry. They're not ambitious in the way that they want to
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:25.620]   seize power. But really, true leaders are humble. True leaders are humble and not power
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:30.900]   hungry. I see I'm triggering a lot of holy conversation in the chat room about Gradiator
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.900]   Now. Well done, everyone. And I'm seeing lots of smiles and giggles, clearly not about my
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:41.540]   sermon because it was supposed to be very serious. Okay. Anyway, pay attention, class.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:47.100]   Goodness me. Anyway, it is a really good movie. Yes, I did say you could talk, but now I'm
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:54.100]   regretting it. We should have closed the chat room. Note to self. Man, here I was thinking
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:03.140]   Judges 9 was just so compelling. It was more about Gladiator. Anyway, bad leadership 101.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:09.820]   True leaders are not supposed to be power hungry. Number two is this. True leaders do
[00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:14.820]   not recruit badly. You see, verse four, he takes this money and he goes, and who does
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:20.980]   he hire? Worthless and reckless fellows. People who he thinks will basically agree with his
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:26.020]   thoughts. You see, he knew what he was doing. He knew what he was doing because he knew
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:31.980]   he had to hire people who would not disagree with him. He had to hire people who would
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:37.980]   basically just do as he says. You see, true leaders, good leaders, godly leaders surround
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:44.780]   themselves with godly people. Surround themselves with people who they know will hold them accountable,
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:50.980]   who will tell them the truth. Abimelech, this king, surrounded himself with reckless fellows
[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:56.500]   who basically would do whatever he said and would not hold him accountable at all. He
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:00.860]   surrounded himself with people who were of the same mind. But if you're a true leader,
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.540]   you would assemble people around you in your friendship groups. If you were a leader in
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:12.220]   the corporate field, you would hire people who would hold you accountable, who will basically
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.260]   disagree with you when you are wrong. Okay. And so this really brings me to my second
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:23.060]   thought, my second conviction, which is this, inside the heart of every person is the desire
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:28.620]   to be agreed with, to be listened to and to be agreed with. Inside the heart of every
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:33.860]   person is that desire to be agreed with. You know, Galatians, the apostle Paul talks about
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:39.860]   this 110, you know, are you seeking the approval of man or of God? And Abimelech is just finding
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.700]   people who will do whatever he says and basically do it. But really what we need, if we are
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.580]   to be leaders, and actually, what I can say here to all of these faces on the screens
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:56.460]   here, you are all called to be leaders. You are all called to be leaders because the church,
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.660]   the body of Christ is supposed to be the one that's leading people to God. And so it's
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:07.180]   very key that we, all of us here, surround ourselves with people who are not just yes
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:12.580]   men. We can see how damaging and destructive that is when we see some governments that
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:20.460]   maybe have this problem. We need to have people who are willing to hold us accountable. You
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:26.380]   see, there's a passage in scripture, which is a bad company corrupts good morals. And
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.940]   of course, Abimelech didn't really need any help getting corrupted, but you get the point
[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:37.900]   here, which is that it is so important to be surrounded by good and godly people. So
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:43.300]   my question to all of us here is this, how are the people that are surrounding you? What
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:48.620]   are they like? Are they godly? Do they hold you accountable? Do they support you in the
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:54.260]   right way? Do they push you towards God or are they distracting you away from God? And
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:21:00.900]   how do you perceive these people? Do you live for their approval? Or actually, are you actually
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:06.500]   able to put God as the highest and have these people around you? Who are the people that
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.260]   are surrounding you? And the other point is this, he did not invest in any of these people.
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:15.620]   He simply gave them money and they were just hired guns to basically help murder his brothers
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:20.420]   for him. And of course, I don't think any of us here are thinking of doing that right
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.860]   now, at least I hope not. But who are the people that God has placed around you? Or
[00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:29.060]   rather, who are the people that you're choosing to put around you yourself? You see, good
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:34.940]   leadership, good leaders choose carefully who they put around themselves. They invest
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:40.340]   in the right people and they are all people who are godly. So it's up to us to invest
[00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:48.460]   in the right people. And the final point is this, Bad Leadership 101.3 is he was pride
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:55.020]   filled. Ibn Malek's journey was all about pride. It was pride that caused him to want
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:00.940]   to be king. It was pride that caused him to get the money and recruit people to then kill
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:06.460]   others. It was pride that caused him, once his own people, the people of Shechem turned
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:10.500]   against him, it was pride that caused him to want to destroy his own town. He basically
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:15.180]   sabotaged his own kingdom. And then it was pride, something tripped in him, it caused
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.020]   him a power trip where he then decided, you know what, I'm just going to go and attack
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:23.060]   and capture the next town. And it was pride that caused him to basically lead himself
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:28.980]   to his own death. And it was pride that even before dying, in those final few moments,
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:34.300]   he still couldn't let it go. And he still needed his soldier to draw his sword to kill
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.540]   him so that it's not a woman who kills him. Can you see that this guy is just so full
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:46.260]   of pride, that this old saying that pride comes before every fall. And again, that pride
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:52.380]   comes from that desire to be lifted up to be God. And so my final reflection for me
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:59.540]   is inside every person is that desire to be exalted. Inside every person is that desire
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:05.460]   to be exalted and to be acknowledged and to be shown to be significant, important, talented.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:12.820]   But you see, it's ironic, because it's his pride that led to his destruction. And Jesus
[00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.820]   talks about this. He says, the first will be last and the last will be first. Those
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:21.820]   who exalt themselves will be humbled. And it's only those who humble themselves who
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:29.580]   will be exalted. And Abimelech showed us that leadership is pride filled. And so that's
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:35.660]   Abimelech. Really, it shows us no good example of any good leadership. But it really reminds
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:39.140]   me and whilst we're looking at this, and we might be discouraged that wow, these people
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:46.180]   are so bad, I hope it really causes us to reflect on actually, where in my heart is
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:51.220]   there a little bit of Abimelech? And also, finally, to be encouraged that actually, there
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:58.260]   is a good leadership example out there. You see, at every area where Abimelech fell and
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:06.620]   failed, Jesus redeems and shows what good leadership is. So every opportunity that Abimelech
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:14.260]   had to display bad leadership 101, Jesus comes to redeem and shows us a good leadership 101.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:20.300]   See, Jesus himself wasn't power hungry. He had the highest renown already. He had the
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.660]   throne in heaven. Yet, what does it say in Philippians? He didn't count equality with
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:31.140]   God something to be grasped. Instead, he let it go. And he humbled himself. He left his
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:37.260]   own throne to come down. And that's what made him the example that we should all follow.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.900]   He humbled himself and dethroned himself. And even when he got here, not only did he
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:47.460]   choose to be born in a manger, but then even as an adult, he chose to wash his disciples'
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:53.820]   feet. He was the servant king. He was the one who showed us that true leadership is
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:59.420]   humble and not power hungry. And he also didn't recruit poorly. Yes, he chose disciples that
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.580]   had their flaws, but he invested in them. He spent three, four years living with them,
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:10.100]   doing life with them, making disciples of them. And that group of 12 ended up changing
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:16.540]   the world, ended up outliving the Roman empire, and ended up imitating him and being willing
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:24.620]   to lay down their own lives. And true good leadership is not pride filled. Jesus had
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.820]   the opportunity to have all the kingdoms. Even when he came down to the earth and he
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:33.460]   was taken into the wilderness by the spirit and he was face to face with the enemy, the
[00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:38.060]   enemy said, "Hey, look, here's a shortcut. You could be done with this. You don't need
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:42.420]   the cross. Look, if you came for the world, I'll give you the world. Here you go. You
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.940]   can have all the world. You just need to bow down to me. That's all you need. And you can
[00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:52.380]   get everything. Everything can be at your feet." And yet Jesus resisted. Jesus humbled
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.060]   himself to the Father's will. He humbled himself to the Father's will, even when he didn't
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:03.620]   feel like it. And that's where he asks, "It's your will that is done, Lord. I just want
[00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:10.660]   what you want, Father." So Jesus shows us that to be the best leader, we have to not
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:17.500]   be power hungry. We have to surround ourselves with the right people and we have to be humble.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.460]   The best leaders in the world right now then are the people who are willing to follow him.
[00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:29.340]   The best leaders are the best followers. His leadership is one of submitting to God's authority
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:35.820]   and ending up with being having every name, the name above every name. And he is the only
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:42.300]   one that is worthy of us following him. So my prayer for all of us, as I conclude, is
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:48.180]   this. And a question that I want to ask you all to reflect is, are there any areas in
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:55.180]   your life where you could do with swapping out this Abimelech trait and swapping in a
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:02.140]   Jesus trait? Is there any area of your life where you are just still trying to wrestle
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:08.980]   control from God? And I want to encourage you to look to Jesus, that Jesus in his love
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:16.460]   for you was willing to let himself completely go and empty himself for you. And that is
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:24.580]   the best kind of leader. He is the example that we should aim to follow. And for us,
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:29.020]   as we are leaders in our industries, in our fields, or just in our friendship groups,
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:34.420]   we pray that we will exhibit that same trait that Jesus did, that we are the best leaders
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:40.620]   because we are the best followers of God. And our prayer is that the spirit is the one
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:47.620]   that guides us in any and every aspect of our lives. Let's pray.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:57.980]   Father Lord, we thank you. We thank you that the Bible is real. The Bible is real and that
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:05.600]   it doesn't eliminate bad examples and characters like Abimelech, but that we get to see mankind
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:10.460]   that is worse. And we get to recognize and repent ourselves that actually, even in these
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:16.220]   terrible characters, there are some traits that we exhibit that are not too far off from
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:22.340]   them. And so Lord, I pray that you, your spirit will purify us and cleanse our hearts and
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:27.180]   search our hearts so that if there is any Abimelech in us, that Lord, in your name,
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.180]   they be removed. But Lord, that we decrease and you increase in our lives and that we
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:38.500]   all are molded and every day sanctified to becoming more and more like you. Lord, you
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:44.140]   are the true leader that we seek to follow. You are the servant king and we live and seek
[00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:51.580]   to follow your example. So we pray that you will reveal yourself more and more to us Lord.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:57.060]   Thank you God. And as we go into a time of reflection with a song, Lord we pray that
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:02.260]   the words in the song will really guide us and be the cry of our hearts as we leave this
[00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:08.020]   Zoom call and share with each other. And as we live our lives in this strange time, Lord
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:13.260]   that we, our hearts, will follow you with all our hearts, all our minds. We thank you
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.540]   God. In Jesus name, Amen.
