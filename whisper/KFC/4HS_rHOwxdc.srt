00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Hey all, welcome to Online Church. I just want to encourage you all just to step into a place where we can open our hearts to what God has for us today

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 and that we can really worship Him with our whole hearts and our whole beings.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 So whether that's if you change things up or you sit, stand, kneel, lie down, just really encourage you to just get into a place, whatever that is for you, where you can just worship Him fully.

28
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 I see His love and mercy washing over all our sins. People sing. People sing.

 I see His generation rising up to take their place with selfless faith, with selfless faith.

32
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I see Him in revival stirring as we pray and sing. We're on our knees. We're on our knees.

41
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Thank you, worship team. We're going to spend a bit of time now as a church, praying. It's so important, even with KFC online, for us to spend this time to pray for the needs of our world and to pray for the needs of Hong Kong.

42
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 So, if you'd like to join with me, firstly I'll pray for the world situation and then Bonnie will pray for Hong Kong.

43
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Father God, we thank you that we can meet together, that we have this freedom to worship you, even online today.

44
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 We pray for our world situation. We pray for world leaders. We know, Lord, their job is not easy. And we pray for the deteriorating virus around the world, for the increase in the number of cases.

45
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 We pray for medical staff everywhere. And we pray, Lord, that you give leaders, medical teams and others the wisdom to be able to deal with this virus.

46
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 We recognize, above all, Lord, that you're the healer. And we ask for you to come upon our world, bring healing, bring restoration.

47
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 I pray particularly today for those who have been bereaved, have lost loved ones. I just pray you'll comfort them.

48
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And I pray that your church around the world will rise up at this time and to be the church that's outside the buildings.

49
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Help us to be your hands and feet. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen.

50
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Yeah, Lord, just thank you so much for this opportunity to be able to still do church online, Lord.

51
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 We just want to pray for our city's leaders and just pray that you will continue to give them wisdom, Lord.

52
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 And just, yeah, Lord, the courage to be able to make hard decisions, even when it affects our city a lot, Lord.

53
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 We also pray for the people, Lord. We pray for their safety from the epidemic, Lord. We pray for people's businesses.

54
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 We know that the economy has been not as good as it could have been in recent days, Lord.

55
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 But we just know that you are the provider, Lord. We know that you will continue to provide and make sure that we are well, Lord.

56
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 So we just, yeah, Lord, we just pray for our city and for our people.

57
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Lord, we also pray for our churches, Lord, across Hong Kong. We pray that all of us will continue to stay faithful during this time,

58
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 especially those who have just been struggling with their faith during this difficult time, Lord.

59
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 We also pray that those in the churches will be able to just be your hands and feet during this time, Lord,

60
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 to just reach out and to care for other people, even though we may be restricted to gatherings of four.

61
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 So, yeah, Lord, we just pray that you will continue to give us love, care and compassion,

62
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 and that we would really be able to fully demonstrate your strength and your compassion.

63
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 And just also, yeah, Lord, really be true witnesses and followers of you. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.

64
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 Yes, Lord, we pray for Pastor James as he brings this word to us.

65
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 Just pray that this word will come to our heart, Lord, that it will just not be words, but the words will be turned into action in Jesus' name.

66
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Amen. And now the word of God.

67
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 Hello, everyone. So we continue with the series on Jesus as King.

68
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And as we're building up to Easter, really exploring all the different facets of Jesus' kingship over our lives,

69
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 his sovereignty over this world. And today we're going to be looking at the King's recital.

70
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 And, you know, one of the things about Jesus is that he was a storyteller. He loved telling stories.

71
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 We all love listening to stories because stories often give us so much help in helping us remember some of life's lessons.

72
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Maybe we all remember the story of Boy Cries Wolf and the lessons that we learn as a child during that time.

73
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 And Jesus used stories and he called them parables. And these parables would be packed with layers and lessons where we could learn from.

74
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And one of the reasons why he used them is that it really gave the people who really wanted to learn a chance to learn.

75
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 You know, Jesus says those who seek will find. And in the parables of all these layers and lessons,

76
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 we could delve into them and be guided by the spirit in really having lessons that we can take away and apply into our lives.

77
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 And today in this short message, I want to cover two very, very short parables, two very short stories Jesus told to teachers.

78
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 Something about the kingdom of heaven, something about his kingdom.

79
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 And if I can ask you to turn with me to Matthew, chapter 13, verse 44 to 46.

80
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 There's only three verses and there's two parables worth here as well.

81
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 So let me just read them to you. The parable of the hidden treasure.

82
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which a man found and covered up.

83
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And in his joy, he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.

84
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.

85
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 So two parables, very short, right next to each other, often treated as twins and often preached on together, which is what I'm doing today.

86
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 As we look at these three verses, I wanted to share three very simple observations about what I found when I read these two parables and some lessons that we can apply to our situation right now.

87
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 And the first one is this. The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field.

88
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 A treasure that is hidden in a field. Now, it's important to note here, the kingdom of heaven isn't the treasure itself necessarily, but the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field.

89
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 This treasure that is of ultimate worth, that this labourer, most likely a labourer who found whilst working a field that did not belong to him.

90
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 You see, treasure back in those days was quite commonly found buried in the ground, because back then there were no banks.

91
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 So if you had any valuables, you would often bury them in the field so no one would find them.

92
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 But of course, over time, people would die and some of these treasures would just stay in the ground because their location, their whereabouts would not be told to loved ones around.

93
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 So then what happens here is there's most likely a labourer who's working the field that does not belong to him.

94
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 And as he's working, he finds this treasure. And the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field.

95
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 And this reminds me of something that often the kingdom of heaven, often God is found in the ordinary.

96
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 It's found in the field that we're working and it doesn't even look that sassy.

97
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 Yet, that is where we find the kingdom of heaven.

98
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 You see, we're often always engrossed with this idea that God is extraordinary, supernatural, and he is all those things.

99
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And we can think back to maybe, for those of us who are believers, think back to big events in our lives where God has shown up,

100
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 whether it was in a conference or in a big event or maybe a big life moment like getting married or having children or getting your dream job.

101
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But if we're not careful, we start trying to associate God with the whole of our lives, but just limit him to some of those extraordinary events.

102
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 When really God is everywhere and God is in the extraordinary, but also in the ordinary.

103
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 The kingdom of heaven is like treasure that is hidden in a field.

104
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And so for me, especially during the season, during the coronavirus, where a lot of us are just isolating at home,

105
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 we often need the reminder that actually God is with us, even in those ordinary moments,

106
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 even in those times where it doesn't feel that spiritual, where it doesn't feel that fun,

107
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 yet reminding ourselves that God is actually with us.

108
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 God is in the ordinary and in the extraordinary.

109
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 You know, the prophet Elijah in the Old Testament in 1 Kings 19, he was waiting to hear from God as well.

110
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 And as he was waiting to hear from God, first there was a strong wind, but God wasn't there.

111
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 And then there was an earthquake, but God wasn't there.

112
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Then a big fire came and God wasn't there.

113
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 It was after all these big events that happened that God then turned up and he showed up in a still, small voice.

114
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field.

115
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 And then we see the apostle Paul in Romans 1 talking about God, his invisible attributes are seeped into creation itself.

116
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 For those who want to find it, will find it.

117
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 And this really makes me think that actually whilst the kingdom of heaven is hid often in the ordinary, it can still be found.

118
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And what we see here in these two parables is you have one who is a labourer, who found it by accident,

119
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 by working a field, by doing work, getting on with life in this ordinary field and stumbling across this treasure.

120
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 But then you find another example, which is the second parable, where the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls.

121
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And he's actually searching for the kingdom of heaven.

122
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 So the kingdom of heaven, although it is hidden, can also be found.

123
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And it's up to us to go and look for it.

124
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It's up to us to go and seek and search and yearn for the kingdom of heaven.

125
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 In Matthew chapter 6, Jesus talks to us about 'ask and you will receive, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be opened'.

126
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 It's our job, living on this earth, to go and find this creator, to go and find him and he is there.

127
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 Although hidden, he is there to be found.

128
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 And you know, in Jesus' sermon on the man in the Beatitudes, chapter 5 verse 8 in Matthew, says this,

129
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 'Blessed are those who are pure in heart, for they shall see God'.

130
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 And we often use that verse to kind of help us in the battle against lust and temptation.

131
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 But actually, when Jesus says the words 'blessed are those who are pure in heart',

132
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 he's actually talking about blessed are those who have a single-minded devotion, who have a tunnel vision in seeking God.

133
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 Basically, it's those who want to see God, will see God.

134
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And so the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field. It is hidden and can be found.

135
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 That is the first point.

136
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 So my question really to all of us is, how much are we trying to notice and be aware of God in these ordinary surroundings?

137
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 When we're trapped at home, when there doesn't seem to be much going on, how aware are we of his presence?

138
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 How much are we looking for him in the ordinary and in the extraordinary?

139
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 Because he's there in both. How aware are we of God's presence, of the kingdom of heaven in our lives?

140
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 That was the first point.

141
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 The second one is this. The verse carries on in verse 44,

142
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 'Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field'.

143
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 See, this labourer who's working this field finds this treasure, covers it up.

144
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 This parable isn't trying to give us any kind of ethics or moral teaching here.

145
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 It's just a story to highlight the value of the kingdom of heaven.

146
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 So he covers it up, then he goes away, and in his joy he sells everything that he has to buy that field.

147
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Because once he buys the field, then the treasure is his.

148
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 In his joy, that's his response. It's full of joy.

149
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 He knows the worth of the treasure, and he's willing to give up everything that he has for it.

150
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 How often in our Christian lives do we sometimes think,

151
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 'Ah, there's so many things I have to give up to be a Christian.

152
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 There's so many things that I can't do to be a Christian. There's so many rules to follow.

153
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 God is so cramping my style. I'm not allowed to do this, I'm not allowed to do that.

154
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 God, do you understand how much you're asking me to give up?'

155
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 But really, it's just down to a question of worth.

156
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 Do we really know how much the gospel is worth in our lives?

157
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 Do we really know the true value of knowing Jesus?

158
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 So the question is, like, is $500 expensive?

159
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Well, it depends what you're buying with that $500.

160
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 If you're wanting to buy a chocolate bar with that $500, then I'd say that's very, very expensive.

161
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 But if you're wanting to buy a house with it, then I'd say it's very, very cheap.

162
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 So when it comes to talking about the kingdom of heaven, we first need to realise what its worth is.

163
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 The labourer in the field in this parable knows the worth of the treasure.

164
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 And he's willing to sell everything that he has and be completely filled with joy about it,

165
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 because he knows what he's getting in return.

166
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 So often when we're moaning or just complaining or just feeling down about everything that we feel as though we have to give up,

167
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 what it maybe really is telling us is we don't really truly know the worth of knowing Jesus Christ.

168
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 When we're complaining about our lives, when we're not filled with thankfulness and gratefulness,

169
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 maybe that's what's really showing, being exposed, is that we don't really truly know the value and the worth of being in a relationship with our Creator.

170
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 You know, the Apostle Paul in Philippians talks about it like this.

171
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 He said, "All I once held dear I count now as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus Christ."

172
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 So Paul, who had so much in life, once he met Jesus, he knew that that was incomparable,

173
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 that he would willingly give up everything that he had before because knowing Jesus was that worthwhile,

174
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 knowing that Jesus was really worth that much.

175
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 The Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field which a man found and in his joy sells all that he has.

176
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 Which brings me to a second point within this second point.

177
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 It's that this guy sells everything that he has.

178
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And what it tells me is when we're talking about the Kingdom of Heaven, when we're dealing in this currency, there really is no halfway house.

179
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 This guy did not in his joy go and sell half that he has to get the Kingdom of Heaven.

180
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 But he has to sell everything.

181
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 There is no halfway house. We have to be all in.

182
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 Again, this goes back to the Beatitude.

183
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 "Blessed are those who are pure in heart, single-mindedly, utterly devoted to the Kingdom of Heaven."

184
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 And so what we see here is this guy is willing to give up everything to gain a relationship with Jesus.

185
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And for us, sometimes, I think, at least especially for me, I ask, "Why isn't God filling me up more?

186
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 Why aren't I feeling his presence more?"

187
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 And then I wonder actually whether it's because I've not really been willing to let go of certain things.

188
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 I'm not willing to empty my hands. So how can he fill me?

189
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 If we're only willing to go half the way, if we're still holding on to some of the sins, holding on to some of the distractions or desires of this world,

190
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 then there's no wonder why God can't fill us.

191
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Because we're holding on to these different things.

192
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 So what about us? Do we have that joy when we encounter God and the Gospel?

193
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Do we have that joy that spurs us on to wanting to sell everything that we have, to let go of it all,

194
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 to count everything that we once held dear as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus?

195
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 You know, one of the things that this coronavirus situation has brought about is the fact that our lives are now completely stripped out.

196
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 A lot of the things that we had, especially in a city like Hong Kong, where we're used to living on 15-minute schedules and timetables,

197
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 with all these things going on in our lives, now they're all stopped.

198
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And I was thinking about this. I was like, "You know what? Life really is quite tough right now because there's so many things that we can't do."

199
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 And then it just really started to make me think, "Well, actually, what were the non-negotiables in my life anyway?

200
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 What were the key pillars? What are the most important things in my life?"

201
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 And I'm thinking, "Oh, well, the most important things are, I guess, family, spending time with those we love,

202
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 spending time with God, reading His Word, praying, being in fellowship with brothers and sisters, and eating is important, I guess."

203
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Then I was like, "Oh, we've not lost any of those things."

204
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 In fact, what the virus situation has done is forced us to stop, to let go of a lot of the distractions that we filled our lives with before.

205
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 And then it made me think, "Actually, in that case, I really need to think about what my non-negotiables are.

206
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 What are the key pillars in my life?

207
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 What are the things, actually, when life does return to normal, that I really shouldn't let back into my life now that I've let them go?

208
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 What were the distractions before that, now that I've had to stop, but what are the things that maybe I could do without?"

209
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Because that's what a crisis does. It really makes you re-evaluate what is important to you.

210
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 And for us as believers, as we look at this passage here, this labourer is filled with joy as he sells everything that he has.

211
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Do we have that joy in letting everything that we have go, and in exchange, gaining a relationship with Jesus Christ,

212
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 in exchange, gaining the Kingdom of Heaven and eternity with Him?

213
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 That is my second point. In His joy, He sold all that He had because of the surpassing worth of the Kingdom.

214
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 And the final point is this. The second parable says this, "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,

215
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 who on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it."

216
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And in many ways, this parable is connected and related to the first parable.

217
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 It's talking about the priority of the Kingdom of Heaven.

218
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 And as I was thinking about this, I realised there's another way to look at this second parable as well.

219
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Because the first one is a labourer who is working hard and eventually uncovers a treasure in a field.

220
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 The second one is a merchant in search of fine pearls who is actively searching.

221
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 And yes, that could be us actively searching for the Kingdom of Heaven, actively searching for God.

222
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 But on the other hand, what this really reminds me was that Jesus Himself could be that merchant in search of fine pearls.

223
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Maybe the second parable turns it around completely, whereas the first one is about us looking for God,

224
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 the second one is about God looking for us.

225
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 Can you imagine that our King, the Prince of Heaven, like this merchant in search of fine pearls,

226
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 would search for us and look for us, and when He finds us, He deems us worthy enough to let go of everything that He has.

227
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 In Philippians 2 it talks about this, that Jesus, even though He was in the form of God,

228
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 He did not count equality with God as something to be grasped.

229
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 When He saw us, He deemed us valuable enough, of so much worth that He was willing to give His life for us.

230
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 This King that we serve, this shepherd who's willing to leave the 99 to go and find this one,

231
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 now looks at us, each of us as individuals and says, "You are worth it.

232
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 You are that fine pearl that I'm willing to sell everything that I have, my status and my throne in Heaven,

233
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 and come down to Earth and sacrifice myself for you, because you, my child, are worth it."

234
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 Isn't that a great feeling?

235
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 We are the subject of this great King's love, that He would lavish and pour out His love on us, exchange His own life for us.

236
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 That was His response to us.

237
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 So how do we respond to Him?

238
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 Do we continue to be distracted by the things of this world?

239
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Do we continue to hold on to all those things?

240
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Or do we respond with gratefulness, with thankfulness, and with joy,

241
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 and let go of the things that are not so important and focus on the key pillars in our lives?

242
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 And the most key, the highest priority, is the Kingdom of Heaven in our hearts.

243
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 Jesus Christ Himself living with us.

244
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 How willing are we to commit our lives to Him?

245
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 These two parables are about priority.

246
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 They're about how much value we place in God, how much worth we ascribe to Him.

247
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 For us Christians, we often sing worship songs when we gather together.

248
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 And of course the term "worship" derives from the term "worth."

249
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 And when we're worshipping God, we're ascribing worth to Him.

250
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 We're declaring and we're singing through song that He is worth our everything.

251
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 That there are no riches in this world that compare to the richness of being in relationship with Him.

252
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 That's why we worship.

253
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 So as we respond now in Psalm, I encourage you, brother and sister, to really ponder on your own life.

254
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 But actually, is God already working in your ordinary, seemingly mundane or even challenging life?

255
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 How hard are you working in finding Him in those places, in the less glamorous places,

256
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 especially during this time when we're not able to gather together?

257
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 And once you find Him, are you filled with joy?

258
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 And are you willing to give up everything else that you have and make Him your priority?

259
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 Of course the answer should be yes, because He made us His priority.

260
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 Brothers and sisters, bless you.

261
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And during this difficult time where we're still physically distancing,

262
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 may the Spirit of God fill your homes and your families.

263
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Goodbye.

264
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 [music]

265
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Oh, I am Lord, here before you, reaching out for more.

266
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 You're the promise, never failing.

267
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 You are my reward.

268
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 You are my reward.

269
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 I let go of all I have just to have all of you.

270
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 And no matter what the cost, I will follow you.

271
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Jesus, everything I've lost, I have found in you.

272
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 When I finally reach the end, I'll say, "You are worth it all."

273
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 [music]

274
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 There's no richer earthly treasure that could satisfy

275
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 every longing for you, Jesus.

276
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 Set this heart on fire.

277
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 Set this heart on fire.

278
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 I let go of all I have just to have all of you.

279
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 And no matter what the cost, I will follow you.

280
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 Jesus, everything I've lost, I have found in you.

281
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 When I finally reach the end, I'll say, "You are worth it all."

282
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 You are worth it all.

283
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 When I'm there.

284
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 When I'm there in your glorious presence,

285
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 every knee is bowed before you.

286
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,000
 Hear the sound of heaven singing, "You are worth it all."

287
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 All the saints sing, "Holy, holy." Angels sing, "You're worthy, worthy."

288
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 Forever I will shout your praises.

289
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
 You are worth it all.

290
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 When I'm there in your glorious presence,

291
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 every knee is bowed before you.

292
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Hear the sound of heaven singing, "You are worth it all."

293
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 All the saints cry, "Holy, holy." Angels sing, "You're worthy, worthy."

294
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 Forever I will shout your praises.

295
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 You are worth it all.

296
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 Worth it all.

297
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 I let go.

298
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 I let go of all I have just to have all of you.

299
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 And no matter what the cost, I will follow you.

300
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:22,000
 Jesus, everything I've lost, I have found in you.

301
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,000
 When I finally reach the end, I'll say, "I love you."

302
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 I let go of all I have just to have all of you.

303
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 And no matter what the cost, I will follow you.

304
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
 Jesus, everything I've lost, I have found in you.

305
00:38:49,000 --> 00:39:01,000
 When I finally reach the end, I'll say, "You are worth it all."

306
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:07,000
 You are worth it all.
