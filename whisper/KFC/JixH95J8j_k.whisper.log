[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Today I will share with you about the KFCC.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   I have said for a long time that I will go to KFCC.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   I will go this year.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   I will step out of this place in May or June.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   You may see me on Sunday.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   I will be at KFCC.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   KFCC is not about last year or recently.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   It is because of the idea of 2020.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I hope that through the 4 walls of the church,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   we can lead people to the community and serve those in need.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   What have we done in the past few years?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I have a short clip to share with you.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Please share the clip with me.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   In this short clip, I have talked about what we have done in the past 2-3 years.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   If you pay attention, you will see that in August,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   we held a "Dream Flyer" event in the second floor.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   It teaches students how to fly a plane.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   If you notice, there is a girl who is sitting on a wheelchair.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   This girl is just like everyone else.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   She is healthy. She is not born with it.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   However, during COVID-19,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   she had her first vaccine and became like this.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   She could not move her whole body.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Only her head could move.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   When we heard about this, we were shocked.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   How could this happen?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   She is just like us. She is a lively girl.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   She is a normal student.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   But in the end, she had to spend her life on a wheelchair.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   When she arrived, her mood was not good.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   She thought that she had not been to church before.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   She did not know why, but she knew about this event.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   She was still able to believe that her dream would come true.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Although she was sitting on a wheelchair,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   she still believed that her dream could come true.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So she joined this event.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   When she arrived, everyone was shocked to hear her story.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   We did not have any sympathy or anything special for her.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   We just wanted to make it easier for her to participate.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   If you saw the video, we were playing a game of wheelchairs.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   She could join us.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   After four days of church,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   her parents came to visit her.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   They were very grateful to God.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   They believed in Jesus and were saved.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I believe that in the future,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   there will be more stories like this in KFCC.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   These stories will not only happen in KFCC.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I believe that everyone here has their own story.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Your stories can also inspire the local people to know God better.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Today, I would like to share a scripture with you.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   This scripture is in Proverbs 11, 24-28.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It says,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   "Those who have a good heart are more generous,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   those who are too cautious are rebellious,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   those who are too selfish are too generous,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   those who are too wise are too wise."
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It is obvious that those who are too cautious
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   will receive more blessings and more blessings.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Those who are helpful will receive more blessings.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   This is a very special principle in the Bible.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Why? Because it is said in the world that
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   the more we save, the more we will have.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Is this what the world thinks?
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   The more we save, the more we will have.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   But it is completely different in the law of God.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   When we are willing to share with others,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   God has given us resources,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   which include money, time, love, and talent.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   God has bestowed all these things on us.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   If we are willing to share our time, love, and talent,
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   our lives will be more abundant.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It is not just about material abundance.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Our souls will be more abundant.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   On the other hand, it is also said that
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   when we are not willing to share with others,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   we may lose what we have.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Why?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   When we are not willing to share with others,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   we will naturally feel empty and lonely,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and even lose the blessings from God.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   I would like to share with you
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   the love, talent, time, and material abundance
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   that Jesus Christ has given us.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Why do we need to care for those in need?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   First, if we are Christians,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   this is a testimony of love.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   When we practice the teachings of Jesus Christ,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   we are shown the love of Jesus Christ by others.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   When we sit here every week,
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   we hear that the core value of Christianity is love.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Do we sit here every week and be a Christian?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   No, we don't.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   We must practice what we have learned
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   and show the love of Jesus Christ to others.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Second, we need to change the lives of those in need.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   A simple action can change a person's life.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I remember that I did an interview with Dr. Ho
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and the women in the interview were all single parents.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   When they see young people visiting them,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   they are the happiest.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Not only can they have time to talk to them,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   but they can also have life-changing interactions.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I believe this is an important element of life-changing.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Third, we need to cultivate our character.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   We need to learn to be reasonable,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   to know the needs of others,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   to be patient and to be grateful.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   These are all precious characteristics of life.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Gratefulness.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Everyone sitting here, including me,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   I think we all need to be grateful.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Because it is not necessary for us to be able to breathe,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   to sit here and to go to church.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   We need to learn to be grateful.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Have you heard of the story of a child?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I shared it with you.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   They have never eaten mooncakes.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   They have never eaten radish cakes.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   I believe that by the new year,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   they will not want to eat them anymore.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   There are many children and families
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   who have never even eaten radish cakes.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   So our gratitude is not only for the life-giving elements,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   but also for the good family,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   which has enough food and supplies.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So I ask God to help us learn to be grateful.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Young people, how do you practice this concern?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I hope you can participate in volunteer activities,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   community services, church care,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   volunteer work and charity activities.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I hope you will do these volunteer activities with a sincere heart.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I believe that some of these activities are not sincere.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I know that many of you have to take exams at university.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   So you have to do it for a better portfolio.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   But it is not sincere.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I have seen some young people
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   who have no smile on their faces when they do volunteer work.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I think to myself, "Why don't you go home?"
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   So if you want to do it,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   you really have to do it with a sincere heart.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   If you don't want to participate in volunteer work,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   you can start to learn to care about the people around you,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   including your classmates, family and neighbors.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   You can learn to care about them.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Share time and resources.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Simply accompany, listen and share life materials.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   You can accompany your friends.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Listen to them and tell them whether they are happy or not.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   You don't accompany them to play games.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   You don't accompany them to overcome obstacles.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   You don't need to accompany them too much.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Finally, I want to share with you.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   The Bible has told us that
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   in the 20th chapter of the book of Exodus,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   there is a saying,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   "The more you give, the more you will receive."
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   When we can give with a sincere heart,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   we will feel contentment and joy.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   When we know why we need to help others,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   we can become God's hands and feet.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   God can do it, but he does it through you.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   He brings his love to every corner.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   We say that caring has many benefits.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   First, we can do some explorations
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   to reduce the loneliness of the elders.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   We can encourage our friends to go out and do activities.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   We can help those in need.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   When we have abundant material,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   we are willing to help those in need.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   We say we want a fair society.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   What is the real fairness?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   We need to think about what is the real fairness.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I have told you before what is fairness.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Six char siu bao for two people.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   What do you think is fairness?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Three for each person.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   It is very fair.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   But one person just finished a very full meal of buffet.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   The other person didn't eat for two days.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   How can we be fair if we share the char siu bao for two people?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   So we need to learn what is the real fairness.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   We will discuss it in your group.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   The power of caring is great.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   We often say we are helping others.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   We seem to be very good at helping others.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   But we have grown up in the process of helping others.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   We have cultivated empathy and responsibility.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   We can also encourage the community to help those in need
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   through different activities.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   We can help the community to make progress.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   We can help those in need and
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   encourage those who want to move up.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   We can reduce the government's expenses.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   We can make the world a better place.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   Lastly, I want to encourage everyone.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   You are all young, talented and have a heart.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   I hope you can take this step with courage
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   and help those in need with your heart.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Don't underestimate your own small actions.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   Because every action of yours can bring a lot of change.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   God has given us a lot of grace and ability.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   If we are willing,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   we can make a big change with our small actions.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   I think we can always play and have fun.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   But if you can use your time to think about
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   what you can do for others,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   I believe you can make others happier.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   We have different activities in the South District.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   I have a little announcement.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   On 24th December, the Peace Day,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   which is the Peace Day in 2025,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   we will be at the Hong Kong Children's Centre.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   If you live in that area,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   you will know that there used to be a kindergarten there.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   We are at the kindergarten.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Jose, you are the closest.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   So you can come and help us.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   What will we do at the Hong Kong Children's Centre?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   We will have a radio broadcast for half a day.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   I hope we can make a radio team.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   We will have a time slot for the local residents.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Please continue to help us.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   We can help people who are close to us.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   We can also help people from far away.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   God has given us different leaders and ideas.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I am happy to have invited two former students.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   They have different ideas of God.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   They have been to different places and countries
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   to spread the message of God.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   They have spread the message of God.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Not only helping the local people,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   but also spreading the message of God to others.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   I would like to invite Mavis to share with us.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Good morning everyone.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   My name is Mavis.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   I am currently a fourth year student in university,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   studying in Australia.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Like many of you, I also grew up in this church.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I just came back from a month-long trip
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   in Nagoya, Japan last December.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Have you ever heard of the word "missions"?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   For me, I first heard of "missions"
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   from a vacation Bible study when I was younger.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I always thought missionaries looked like this.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   They are blonde, kind, and courageous.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   They go to Africa to help kids who are hungry
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   and in need of help.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   As a kid, I found these people very inspiring.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I never really put much thought into it.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   I grew up in a Christian family.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   I went to church every Sunday.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   I thought being a Christian was just going to church
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   every week, memorizing scripture, getting stickers,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   and generally being a kind person because
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   love your neighbor as yourself and something like that.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   But I never really understood what I was claiming
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   to believe in and why it is so important to myself.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Before going to university, I was super shy
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   and introverted.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I probably still am.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   I did not know if I could make any friends,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   but God was really gracious to me.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   During my first year, a girl from my church
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   invited me to a camp held by a Christian club
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   on my campus.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   I did not know anyone but her, so I was hesitating
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   if I should go or not.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   But I don't know what got into me,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   but I decided to go and take a step.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   At that camp, I met a lot of Christian uni students.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Though they did not know me, they were really,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   really kind and welcoming and interested to chat.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   As I got a chance to hear their stories
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   and their journeys with God, I saw how God
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   has transformed them, and they were all super joyful
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   and confident.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   But on the other hand, I look at myself
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   and I only see what I could share was only
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   I grew up in a Christian family, and I think I'm Christian.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   After that camp, I felt very convicted
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   to learn more about Christianity.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   So I joined the Christian club and started my journey
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   on being discipled by a missionary.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   We also did walk up, so it was like walking up
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   to strangers every week to ask them about their faith
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   and their background.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Mind you, I was still very, very shy and did not know much
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   about the Bible and theology and stuff like that.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   The first few times were super intimidating,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   and I got really, really tired afterwards.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   I probably still do get really tired after doing that.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   But after stepping out of my comfort zone,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   that was when I really experienced the power of God
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   and the power of prayer.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Before we go out to talk to strangers on campus, we pray.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   I usually feel super awkward because you don't really
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   know how the conversation is going to go.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   But every time I go out, I am reminded that I cannot
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   control other people's minds.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   I can't control how they think of me.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   So the only thing I could do was to rely on God and pray.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   So because of that, I got a chance to meet a lot
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   of different people, and God surprises me every time
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   in different conversations.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   So back to Japan.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Random question for everyone.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Has anyone here been to Japan?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Okay, cool.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   So if so, or if not, what do you think when you think of Japan?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   For me, I think what I think about when I think about Japan
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   is manga, anime, shrines, and food,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   and maybe cool technology.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   And missional work was definitely not on my list.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   So on the surface, Japan seems pretty cool, right?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And very rich country.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   But you guys may know, Japanese culture and work culture
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   is very, very stressful.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   There's also a term for death by overwork called "karoashi."
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   And Japan being a very homogenous country,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   being different from society is seen as being
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   disrespectful of peace.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   So there's a Japanese proverb that says,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   "deru koe wa utareru," which means,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   "The nail that sticks out is hammered down."
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   So a little context about Japan.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   So the population in Japan is about 126 million people,
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   and only 1 to 2%, as you can see over there,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   the red, are Christian.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   So being a Christian is definitely very, very difficult
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   and very different from societal norms in Japan.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   The Christian population being really small in Japan,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Japanese people have never met a Christian in their lives before.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   Some of them don't even know the meaning behind Christmas.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   So it reminded me of this verse in the Bible that says,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   "How then can they call on the one they have not believed in,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   and how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard,
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   and how can they hear without someone preaching to them,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   and how can anyone preach unless they're sent?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news."
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Many people think that going to mission means going to help people
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   that are less fortunate or going to help people that are sick or in need.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   However, a missionary in Japan said this,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   "I cannot show you photos of hungry children, wells to be dug,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   and churches to be built, but I can show you building after building
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   of people that do not know God."
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   This really got to me.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   I think I was really fortunate to have been in a Christian family
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   and had so many opportunities to hear about God's love for me growing up.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   However, in Japan, it is super rare to even find one Christian.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   That is why I went on this mission.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   So what does mission actually look like?
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   I went with a group of 11 people,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   and we got on five different university campuses throughout our month there.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Our main goal was to connect with new students that we meet on campus
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   and journey alongside Christian students that are already connected with local staff.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   So we held events such as a Thanksgiving party--wait, where is it--
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   a Thanksgiving party, a little girls' night--what else--
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   a Christmas party, a Christmas English lesson,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   and also other things that they have over there.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Every Friday they have a little fellowship.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   It was actually not really like work, work, but it's more like connecting with people
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   and chatting with the students there.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   I want to end with a little story.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   During our farewell party, a Japanese Christian student named Tomoe
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   shared a little bit of her testimony.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   She shared that she has always been a Christian,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   but found it really, really hard to say it publicly
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   because of the fear of how people would react when they know she's a Christian.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   She shared that after meeting the team of Australian students
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   and doing outreach together, it reminded her of this passage.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   "For I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   that brings salvation to everyone who believes,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   first to Jews and then to the Gentiles."
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I'm not sure about you.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Have you been ashamed of your faith?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   If so, I hope this passage encourages you.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Please continue to pray for the ministry in Japan.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   People in Japan really need God.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I just want to pray for--please pray for God to continue to send workers there
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   and as the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   This is the end. Thank you for listening.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   If you have any questions, we can have a chat and stuff after.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Thanks, guys.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Thank you, Mavis, for sharing a little bit of your experience.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   In Asia, traveling is a good thing.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   But in the case of the Catholic Church,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Japan is a country of rocks.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   It needs a voice to reach this place.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Mavis is one of our mentors.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   She is the daughter of Auntie Maggie.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Those white-handed people are a bit loud.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   So I think when we become the second or third generation of Christians,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   we need to be grateful.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Not everyone can keep this good faith.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   God, please continue to help us.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Next, Cody will share with us.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Cody didn't go to Asia to preach.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   He went to a place in Europe.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   He will introduce himself.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Before I start, I want you to stand up.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   Then sit down.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Are you tired?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   No? Never mind.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   I want to say that every time you do something,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   there is a price.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   I am a lazy person.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   If the action has no real meaning, I won't do it.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   If someone asked me to stand up, I wouldn't do it.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   I admire you all.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Very good.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   I will explain why I went to Europe to serve God.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   The first picture is of my dad and me.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   My dad is my role model.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   He had cancer at that time.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   He couldn't eat well and sleep well.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   But he continued to read the Bible and preach.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Isn't it tiring?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   Normal people would be tired.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   My mom was also tired.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   It's not easy to take care of a sick person.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   But when you see him serving at church,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   or when he is not feeling well,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   you still want to serve him.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   Why?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   I thought,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   what made my mom and dad serve God so diligently?
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   It was because they saw God's power of transformation.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   God saved our family.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   But this is my parents' story.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Even if I saw God's power,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   I didn't think it was related to me.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   I thought I would follow God for my whole life.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   God is the one I will follow for my whole life.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   But from my school,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   I went to a primary school and then went to a university.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   I didn't think about what I would do for God.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   I don't know what you think of doing something for God.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   But for me,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   doing something for God is a big deal.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   I was a little boy.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   I didn't have the ability to do anything for God.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   I just prayed.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   When I entered university,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   I thought I must do all the things I learned in university.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   I didn't have time to do anything else.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   But when I entered university,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   I still wanted to find a fellowship.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   There were a group of Catholics who were my peers.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   But by accident,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   I accidentally joined a student movement,
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Campus Crusade.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   The organization was amazing.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   It was an organization that encouraged young people to preach the gospel and serve God.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   It was the first time that someone could make people on this earth
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   who had never heard the gospel
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   believe in a statement that was very meaningful.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I thought,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   "Why can I, as a family,
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   experience such a transformative event?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   But what about others?"
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   As the Roman Catholic priest, Mavis, said,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   "There is no chance to hear it."
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   I started to think about what I could do.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   I saw that these students were my age.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Why did people my age love God so much?
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   How much did they love God?
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   They loved the people God loved.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   After they had this love,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   as Pastor Irene said,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   this love had action.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   I followed them and slowly learned how to preach the gospel
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   and how to care for others.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   But if you have ever tried to preach the gospel,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   you need to have a thick skin.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   You don't have to be embarrassed.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Just like Mavis,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   she had to go to the front and preach.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   It was really embarrassing.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   But in the past few years,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   I started to train my skin to be a little thicker.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   When did I start training my skin?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   There were two countries.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   One was on the left.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   You can't guess where it was.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   It was Vietnam.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   I went to Vietnam with my students.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   When I was in the Explorer program,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I had to go to Vietnam to preach.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   What was most impressive was not the need of the place.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   There was a person who was there.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   He was a 20-year-old student.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   He was serving in Vietnam.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   I looked at him and thought,
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   "He is so young, but he is already serving God.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   Can I dedicate my youth to God in the future?"
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   But I didn't tell anyone when I came back.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Because you know,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   when you come back and tell anyone,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   they will push you to do something.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I didn't tell anyone.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   But I still had an action.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   I bought a book called "Divorce"
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   which is about the Sunday prayer of the Catholic Church.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   In addition to the article,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   there were prayers for different countries.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   I still thought that I could do something in the Explorer program.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   I could pray.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   The second country was Ireland.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   It was a green country.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   What made me most worried was
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   that I went to an exchange program for half a year.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   I had a great time there for half a year.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   But behind the joy,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   I saw that many Europeans
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   couldn't hear the prayer.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   We just said that the prayer of worship is the answer of God.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   But they only had many questions.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   The answer was right in front of them.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   They couldn't see the answer.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   So I felt very sad.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   It was like the people in this country
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   really needed to find the answer.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   But guess what I did after that?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   After that deep pain?
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   I prayed.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   I just prayed.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   But don't get me wrong.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Prayer is the foundation of all ministries.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   The ministry of the Lord's Prayer needs to start with prayer.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Or maybe God wants me to pray.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Okay, let's go.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   At the end, I had to graduate from university.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   I went to a camp.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   I participated in the student movement.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   At the end of each year,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   there was a call for prayer.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   What is a call for prayer?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   It's an article.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   After the call, the callers would be invited to respond
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   to the actions of the people of the camp.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   When I entered the camp,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   I thought, "It's okay. It's none of my business."
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   I started to look for a job.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   I was a normal person who just returned from work.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   I was already content.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   But when I was in Fuzhou,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   I was asked,
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   "If God wants you to serve Him in your whole life,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   will you respond to Him without hesitation?"
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   This call was a negative response.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   It was a no-turning-back response.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   When I heard this question,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   I felt like I was being asked.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   If I didn't respond,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   I wouldn't be able to do it.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   At that moment, I knew very clearly
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   that this was a call from God.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   So I responded to this call.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   I forgot to introduce this.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I was in my first year of studying at the Catholic School of the Apostles.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   After I graduated,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   I would serve God as a pastor.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   A few days before I entered the school,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   I opened my Bible.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   It was filled with the words of my time.
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   God encouraged me in this way.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   He was the God who called me.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   After I graduated,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   I returned to Ireland.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   I joined a police station called Operation Mobilization.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   It was a local church.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Although it was a European country,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   there were few Catholics there.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   It was not very developed.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   There were many sheep and farmers.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   I found out that the church did more than I imagined.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   It was not just a weekly visit to the city.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   It was a weekly visit to the community.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   I would bring people to the church
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   and find the answer in their conversations.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   But three years later,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   I still feel very sad.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Why can't they hear the call of God?
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   When I left, I had a big expectation.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   One day,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Ireland would no longer need a Catholic church,
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   or missionaries.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   On the surface of the earth,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   there would no longer be a need for missionaries.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   So I left the country with this expectation.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   But I knew that I had to serve God well.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   I had to dedicate my life to God.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   I had to be used by God.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   But to serve God well,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   I had to do one thing.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   I had to study.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Why did I have to study?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Because I had to learn about the equipment of the church.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   I had to know what I believed in.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   I heard a lot about the church,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   but I had to systematically learn everything.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   I had to know about the equipment,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   and I had to know that I had to follow my heart.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   You know,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   I want to say that
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   there are so many things to learn about the church.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   If I didn't do more,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   how could I have learned so much?
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   So I went to study.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   I had to be used by God in my life.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Finally,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   I don't know if you have ever thought about
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   whether the action I chose
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   was in line with God's plan.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   But this is what the Philippians encouraged me to do.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   They said,
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   "For you have made your decisions
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   according to your own will
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   in order to accomplish His will."
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   We make decisions
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   not because we think we are great,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   but because we want to accomplish God's will.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   What we have to do is to surrender,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   to surrender to God's will,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   and then act,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   and to show the way of life.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   So I have a hope for you,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   that you will use your youth well.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You don't have to go on a mission.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   This place,
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   this community,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   has many needs.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Your family, your friends,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   have many needs.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Can you devote your youth
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   to God's use?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   And if you are willing,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   you can also trust and obey,
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   to show the way of life.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   I will give the floor to Pastor Ari.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Thank you, Cody.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   Thank you, Lord.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   Cody is now studying at the Bordeaux Synagogue.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Studying the Bible is not just
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   because I want to study the Bible.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Studying the Bible requires
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   some kind of evidence,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   and the call of God.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Then you can read it.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   We have some practical students,
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   if you really want to study the Bible,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   you can talk to them,
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   why they suddenly want to study the Bible,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   and devote their youth to study it.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   After hearing them talk about
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   the call of God and their story,
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   I also want to tell you,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   behind KFCC,
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   behind this care center,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   there is one very important thing,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   through the sisters who serve,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   including you,
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   to spread the gospel,
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   and the last step,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   is to establish the first
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   church in Hong Kong.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   May God continue to help us,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   and may we serve the local people
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   in a good way.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   I think today we have two witnesses,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   and it's almost time,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   we may not be able to sing the response song.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   So, Pastor Karen,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   please pray with us.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Let's pray together.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Dear God,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   when we talk about the transformation of life this year,
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   can we live out of the outside world?
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   It's a litmus test to see if our lives have changed.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   Dear God,
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   I pray that you will help us.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Actually, there are many opportunities
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   around us.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   God, you didn't call us to go very far,
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   but there are many people nearby
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   who need you,
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   and who need the response.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   God, I pray that you will remind us again
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   how our lives have been touched by you.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   How much you love us,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   how you have saved us,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   how you have guided us.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   God, how can we bring this love
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   from you to the people around us?
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   God, we may have to pay a price
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   to be with you.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   But God, when we think of you
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   being born on the cross for us,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   shedding blood for us,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   so that we can share this love with you,
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   we know in our hearts
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   that all the costs are worth it.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   God, I pray that you give us courage
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   and let us put down our fear
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   to answer you,
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   to respond to your call.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   God, let our lives
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   not only be for ourselves,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   but also for you.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   May our lives be transformed by you,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   and may it be a life that honors you
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   and also blesses others.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   God, I pray that you continue
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   to lead us on the path ahead.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Help us to live a life
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   that is a blessing to millions of people.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   To respond to the grace of God
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   in our lives.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Let us pray together in the name of Jesus.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   May the grace of Jesus Christ,
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   the love of God,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   the touch of the Holy Spirit
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   be with us
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   until the coming of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Amen.
