1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,760
 - Hello, hello, is that coming through?

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,440
 All right, very good.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,440
 Okay, so when I was young, I loved board games, all right?

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,280
 But there was one game which I loved above all else.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,080
 It was the game to rule all games.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,480
 And it is, of course, the one and only Monopoly.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,560
 (audience laughs)

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,880
 I hear the groans.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,960
 All right, so when extended family was around

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,520
 and everyone agreed to settle in

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,440
 and play Monopoly for a long haul,

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,880
 this was, to me, was like going to Disneyland.

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,960
 I loved it.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,280
 I would terrorize my cousins who would have to hide from me

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,080
 and I would run around looking for them,

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,480
 saying, "Who wants to play the best game in the world?"

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,200
 And they would just hide in fear.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,920
 Mel even got me this classic edition

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,600
 because I love it so much.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,280
 And here you can see us both just really enjoying a game,

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,440
 both having such a great time.

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,720
 Now, there was only one problem with Monopoly.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,160
 It wasn't my strategy and skills.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,520
 I was great with that.

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,000
 But it was the fact that after we had played,

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,240
 the money I had amassed was useless anywhere else, all right?

28
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,960
 I had a portfolio like you would never believe.

29
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,640
 I had property, hotels, cash to the wazoo,

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,080
 but it was useless anywhere else.

31
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,320
 I couldn't even get a bag of lollies, all right?

32
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,520
 So it was like the shopkeeper didn't even know who I was.

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
 The wealth I had amassed was useless.

34
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,840
 And what did I actually do with that wealth while I had it?

35
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,800
 Well, according to various family and friends' accounts,

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,320
 I turned people against me.

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,080
 But when I was playing, nothing beyond that game mattered.

38
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,160
 I could have used that game while I was playing

39
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,000
 so that when the game had finished,

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 I would be in more favour with those others around me.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,240
 It might have been a less exciting game,

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,320
 but afterwards I would have had better results

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,680
 and better standing amongst family and friends.

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,880
 Now, in this parable, we see Jesus tell the story

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,680
 about this man, this unrighteous steward,

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,520
 who uses his position and his resources

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,040
 with his future in mind.

48
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,120
 Jesus uses this illustration to paint the picture

49
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
 of how we as followers of him

50
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,320
 should be using worldly wealth and resources

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,000
 with the kingdom of God in mind and eternity in mind.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,480
 Now, this parable is quite a well-known one

53
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,240
 and also one that can leave us scratching our heads

54
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,240
 as to what it is like Jesus is actually telling us to do

55
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,960
 or what it is he is approving of and what he is commending.

56
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,720
 On face value, we may come away with the impression

57
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,440
 that Jesus is okay with this master's dishonesty

58
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,800
 and even commending it.

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
 Now, it is important for us to address this

60
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,560
 because it is not misunderstood

61
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,040
 as an endorsement for dodgy money practices,

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,480
 but we don't want to get too bogged down in this aspect.

63
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,600
 So in verse one, we see that this man is accused

64
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,640
 of wasting his possessions.

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,480
 Now, the Greek word used here is actually the same Greek

66
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,520
 that Luke uses in the parable of the prodigal son,

67
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,680
 which John preached last week.

68
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,040
 Now, this word he uses to describe

69
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,520
 how the prodigal son uses his inheritance money,

70
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,600
 meaning to squander or to waste.

71
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,600
 So we can say he wasn't just some manager

72
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,960
 who was bad at his work and needed more training,

73
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,960
 but he was abusing his position and wasting money away.

74
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,640
 Now, in verses five to seven, we see the manager's plan

75
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,320
 that is supposed to help him have security

76
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,040
 in his soon unemployment.

77
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,000
 So summoning his master's debtors one by one,

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 he said to the first, "How much do you owe my master?"

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,640
 He said, "A hundred measures of oil."

80
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,040
 He said to him, "Take your bill and sit down quickly

81
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,160
 and write 50."

82
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,240
 Then he said to another, "And how much do you owe?"

83
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,800
 He said, "A hundred measures of wheat."

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,200
 He said to him, "Take your bill and write 80."

85
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,600
 Now, this also seems a little bit dodgy to his master, right?

86
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,200
 Now, while that may be a possibility,

87
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,680
 there are some other likely possibilities and explanations.

88
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,080
 One which many commentaries put forth

89
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,320
 is that this money he was discounting

90
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,800
 was actually from his own commission, okay?

91
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,320
 A very generous commission, granted.

92
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
 (audience laughing)

93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,400
 But, and that may seem crazy,

94
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,160
 but was given some of these margins,

95
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,000
 but is similar to how some tax collectors could operate

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,240
 in a very free, unregulated manner.

97
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,600
 It may have also come from interests

98
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,680
 that would have been charged,

99
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,320
 something that was illegal to do to fellow Israelites,

100
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,080
 according to Deuteronomy, but was practiced anyhow.

101
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,560
 Or it could have been a combination of any of these things.

102
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,840
 Okay, but what this can paint then

103
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,160
 is that rather than the steward

104
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,000
 who further cheats his master for selfish gain,

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,600
 is actually sacrificing his own commission,

106
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,960
 what will be his last paycheck for the foreseeable future,

107
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,600
 at a time when he clearly needs it

108
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,160
 so that he can have a longer term provision and security.

109
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,840
 It then begins to look a lot more like an investment.

110
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,080
 Now, while it's important for us to address this,

111
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,840
 it's not what we wanna get bogged down with.

112
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,800
 Jesus uses this to paint a larger picture

113
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,760
 and a larger point.

114
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,560
 It is not the larger point in and of itself.

115
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,360
 Now, these interpretations would just serve

116
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,280
 to make Jesus' point stronger.

117
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,480
 Now, this illustration was also likely

118
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,000
 much more easily digested

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,160
 for those who were hearing it in real time.

120
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,560
 Much like if someone now talks about buying a house,

121
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
 we know that involves a mortgage, a deposit,

122
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,480
 taxes, lawyers, et cetera.

123
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
 We aren't going to go into the details

124
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,360
 of all those little things

125
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,040
 every time we use buying a house as an analogy.

126
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,360
 So then, what is the master commending in verse eight?

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,360
 Well, his shrewdness.

128
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,360
 Now, we need to take a minute with this word shrewd.

129
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,800
 It's a word that can give us a bit of a funny feeling.

130
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,120
 Like it can mean like, we can think of it as cunning

131
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,600
 or maybe a bit too frugal and tight,

132
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,520
 the kind of person you don't really wanna go

133
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,160
 for a meal or drinks with,

134
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,080
 the kind who's nowhere to be seen when the Maidan comes.

135
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,000
 (audience laughing)

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,720
 So let's try and get rid of that feeling.

137
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,040
 And what is the word?

138
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,560
 The original Greek, which we often see translated

139
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,840
 as shrewd, shrewdness, shrewdly,

140
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,160
 really has the meaning prudently,

141
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,800
 practically wise, acting with forethought.

142
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,120
 And Jesus here is not commending any possible dishonesty

143
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,680
 in verses five to seven.

144
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,280
 And he's certainly not commending the dishonesty

145
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,960
 in verse one, but he is commending his shrewdness.

146
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,160
 He is commending his ability to act wisely

147
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,880
 in preparation for his future.

148
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,880
 Likely at some cost of sacrifice,

149
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,720
 he is commending that his plans was well thought out

150
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,920
 and meant to bring about a desired result.

151
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,040
 The master is commending his shrewdness.

152
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,600
 Now we need to understand that the lesson then

153
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,080
 is not to make money in whatever way you can,

154
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,680
 so then you can use it for the kingdom of God.

155
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,960
 This is where we can easily get trapped

156
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,520
 in the pursuit of money,

157
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,960
 convincing ourselves it's for a noble cause.

158
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,720
 I hate to tell you this,

159
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,400
 God doesn't need your money actually as much as you think.

160
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,920
 Don't get too much relief in that by the way,

161
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,480
 but he is much more interested in our hearts.

162
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,040
 Our money can be a reflection of that,

163
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,880
 but it is often also a guide for our hearts.

164
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,920
 In Mark 12, there is a story of a widow

165
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,200
 who throws in two small copper coins

166
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,360
 while others are throwing in large amounts.

167
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,000
 And Jesus looks at the widow and commends her,

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,520
 for while these other people were giving

169
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,760
 from a place of wealth, she was giving all that she had.

170
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,440
 Now, if it was just a matter of increasing

171
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,280
 the dollar amounts that we give,

172
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,800
 Jesus would be commending those who gave plenty

173
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,600
 and ignoring her.

174
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,520
 But he recognises that she is putting God above her money

175
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,320
 in such a significant way.

176
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,920
 So why use this character

177
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,960
 of the dishonest steward in the parable?

178
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,600
 Now, Jesus uses this shady character

179
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,720
 to help make clearer the comparison

180
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,000
 and the rebuke that we see in verse eight.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,760
 "For people in this world are more shrewd

182
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,600
 in dealing with their own kind

183
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,040
 than are people of the light."

184
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,040
 So even this squanderer can get his head together

185
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,760
 and be shrewd in his planning for what is coming

186
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,560
 and for his future.

187
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,680
 Yet us Christians often aren't wise

188
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,000
 in planning for our future, which is one of eternity.

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,040
 Even this unrighteous man is wise enough

190
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,200
 to use his resources to get people on his side.

191
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,000
 Yet followers of God can't show the same wisdom

192
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,080
 in using their money for kingdom purposes.

193
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,840
 Jesus uses this broken man

194
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,200
 to show us Christians in this rebuke,

195
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,800
 if he can get it, why can't you?

196
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,360
 So verse eight is also really where we get

197
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,720
 to the key of what Jesus is saying.

198
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,880
 Someone who doesn't believe in eternity

199
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,760
 for what will plan for what they value most.

200
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,880
 You know, that might be a nice house, car,

201
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,720
 good family, travel, experiences, whatever that may be.

202
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,160
 They'll make sacrifices, learn skills,

203
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,280
 invest time, money and energy

204
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,080
 so that they can attain and enjoy these things

205
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,120
 that they value.

206
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,600
 They'll research the best loan plans.

207
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,880
 What are the best holiday destination?

208
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,680
 What's the cheapest way I could do this?

209
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,400
 Now we do this also, but then to us Christians furthermore,

210
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,920
 what do we, or what are we supposed to value the most?

211
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,440
 That is God and his kingdom.

212
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,400
 We wanna see the kingdom of God here as it is in heaven.

213
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,440
 And we also wanna spend our eternity in heaven with God.

214
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,320
 We know that our lives go beyond this world.

215
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,360
 And we know that our actions aren't just meant

216
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,360
 to get us nice things, but can have eternal consequences.

217
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,720
 So we can take lessons from those who live in such a way

218
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,760
 for their earthly goals.

219
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,320
 And if they can do that, surely we can live in such a way

220
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,440
 for the kingdom of God, which is so much greater

221
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,520
 than anything they may be living for

222
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,000
 or anything we may have here.

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,720
 Now, so how much does our use of money

224
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,680
 and our resources reflect this?

225
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,400
 How much does our planning and forethought

226
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,960
 reflect our value in the kingdom?

227
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,440
 Do we sit down intentionally and think about this?

228
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,680
 Okay, I'm currently making this much money I've worked out,

229
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,800
 I can put this much towards helping the poor.

230
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,000
 Does our planning and wisdom into how we treat

231
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,920
 our resources in a God honoring way,

232
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,560
 match that of our planning and with planning

233
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,120
 that goes for a holiday.

234
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,040
 And let's review who Jesus is talking to in this parable.

235
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,760
 Let's look at verse one again.

236
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,320
 "Jesus told his disciples."

237
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,880
 This setup is key.

238
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,640
 Who Jesus is talking to in this parable is key.

239
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,920
 And many other parables are directed towards Pharisees,

240
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,960
 those trying to trick Jesus

241
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,120
 or those who wanna learn how to become followers.

242
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,640
 But not that many are directed to the disciples.

243
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,560
 We see later in verse 14,

244
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,680
 that Pharisees were in the vicinity and heard this parable,

245
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,360
 but this is specifically directed to the disciples,

246
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,920
 to those who had signed up and said,

247
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,520
 "I wanna be a follower of Jesus."

248
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
 So if you're a Christian,

249
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,760
 while all the parables relate to you

250
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,880
 and are for you,

251
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,920
 this parable that Jesus speaks is directly to you.

252
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,400
 Consider how important of a lesson this is

253
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,160
 that Jesus is telling.

254
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,600
 Now, these disciples that he's speaking this to,

255
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,560
 are the ones who will start his church

256
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,560
 and advance his message after his death and resurrection.

257
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,200
 And Jesus talks about our worldly wealth

258
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,000
 and wisdom in using it.

259
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,280
 He is saying this to the followers of the church

260
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,160
 that we are a part of today

261
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,120
 and that we are continuing on today.

262
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,560
 So I just wanna make sure we get the significance of that,

263
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,160
 how important it is,

264
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,680
 because how we use our worldly wealth and resources

265
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,440
 is not secondary,

266
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,800
 but actually foundational to our following of Jesus.

267
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,280
 It's not secondary,

268
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,360
 but foundational in our following of Jesus.

269
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,520
 So we don't have a choice in ignoring this.

270
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,960
 So then what about these disciples?

271
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,040
 Did they take this on board?

272
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,840
 Well, let's evaluate.

273
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,080
 In Acts 2, in describing the fellowship of the disciples,

274
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,240
 we read this and let's read this out together.

275
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,960
 I'll take this in, one, two, three.

276
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,080
 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching

277
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,440
 and to fellowship,

278
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,200
 to the breaking of bread and to prayer.

279
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,360
 Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders

280
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,120
 and signs performed by the apostles.

281
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,080
 All the believers were together

282
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,840
 and had everything in common.

283
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,200
 They sold property and possessions

284
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,800
 to give to anyone who had need.

285
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,320
 Every day, they continued to meet together

286
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
 in the temple courts.

287
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
 They broke bread in their homes

288
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,680
 and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,

289
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,640
 praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people.

290
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,320
 And the Lord added to their number daily

291
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,960
 those who were being saved.

292
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,360
 An amazing picture of church.

293
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,920
 And let's look at verse 45.

294
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,280
 They sold property and possessions

295
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,640
 to give to anyone who had need.

296
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,600
 Now, this was an integral part of who they were

297
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,880
 and their ministry.

298
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,480
 In Acts 6, later on,

299
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,800
 we see they had a daily distribution of food

300
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,520
 and the men who oversaw that

301
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,120
 were to be full of the spirit and wisdom.

302
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,560
 They were good stewards of what they had

303
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,920
 and there was an intentionality to what they were doing.

304
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,880
 It wasn't an afterthought or mere obligation,

305
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,920
 but an integral part of who they were.

306
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,840
 And in their faithfulness in this,

307
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,640
 as well as in the other areas,

308
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,520
 we see that they had the favour of all the people

309
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,560
 and the Lord was adding to their number daily.

310
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,800
 We see a very real example of what Jesus says

311
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,840
 in Luke 16, 9,

312
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,720
 in using worldly wealth to gain friends.

313
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,800
 And note how it is that they use their wealth.

314
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,120
 Now, this passage is often applied to all sorts of resources

315
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,560
 such as our time and skills, et cetera.

316
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,040
 Now, while these are applicable,

317
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,400
 it is important to recognise that

318
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,920
 at the heart of this passage,

319
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,560
 it is talking about our money,

320
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,840
 which includes our possessions.

321
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,080
 Because as we look at the verses following,

322
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,960
 Jesus keeps bringing it back to this.

323
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,800
 In verse 9,

324
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,920
 use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourself.

325
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,000
 11, if you have not been trustworthy

326
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,560
 in handling worldly wealth,

327
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,640
 who will trust you with true riches.

328
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,800
 Similarly in 12, with property and property of your own.

329
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,880
 And it cannot be as clear as in verse 13,

330
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,680
 the big knockout punch,

331
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,800
 you cannot serve both God and money.

332
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,960
 Now, verse 11 says,

333
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,400
 if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth,

334
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,040
 who will trust you with true riches.

335
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,280
 If God sees we are poor in handling worldly wealth,

336
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,400
 why would he entrust us with kingdom matters,

337
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,600
 which are of so much greater value?

338
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,400
 Similarly, if the world sees our handling of worldly wealth,

339
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,880
 and it is just corrupt and selfish,

340
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,800
 why would they care what we have to say

341
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,480
 about Jesus and eternity?

342
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,000
 And think about what a shame that is.

343
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,040
 Because if I'm selfish with my money,

344
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,960
 does that change that Jesus is good

345
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,080
 and that he has saved us?

346
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,280
 No.

347
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,600
 But it does make me a poor representative of that.

348
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,200
 And why would anyone trust me

349
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,520
 with what I may say about salvation and eternal life,

350
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,640
 when I handle worldly wealth so poorly,

351
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,760
 and in a manner that doesn't point to a life beyond this one?

352
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,320
 Now, I wanna make a distinction here.

353
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,600
 Often when we hear handling wealth poorly,

354
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,800
 we think of things such as not having

355
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,080
 adequate retirement plans and things of that nature.

356
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,760
 Now, having that is good

357
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,880
 and something we should employ wisdom in.

358
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,880
 But when it is talking about handling worldly wealth

359
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,080
 in this context,

360
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,040
 is much more to do with our generosity,

361
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,040
 our use of money as though there is a life beyond this one.

362
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,120
 When people criticize Christians

363
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,520
 for being hypocritical in this area,

364
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,440
 it's not a critique of our poor performing MPFs

365
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,480
 or stock portfolios.

366
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,080
 It's about greed, hoarding, not caring about the poor.

367
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,320
 So is there a some way we can get out of doing this right?

368
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,320
 Now, this topic is really unavoidable in the Bible.

369
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,280
 The fact that we have to walk with integrity in this area

370
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,200
 is not really up for debate.

371
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,120
 What about if I just am better in other areas to compensate?

372
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,320
 You know, I'll serve more, I'll be kinder, all those things.

373
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,560
 Well, yes, do those things.

374
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,360
 But no, we can't get out of these.

375
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,760
 Jesus warns us in verse 13

376
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,400
 that we cannot serve both God and money.

377
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,800
 We simply can't have it both ways.

378
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,720
 Even if we could attain perfection

379
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,000
 in every other aspect of life, it still wouldn't work.

380
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,760
 And if we did think that we found a loophole,

381
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,880
 actually we are the ones that would lose out from that.

382
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,280
 1 Timothy 6 verse 10 says,

383
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,440
 "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.

384
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,800
 Some people eager for money have wandered from the faith

385
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,920
 and pierced themselves with many griefs."

386
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,880
 Now look at the focus.

387
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,960
 We don't just avoid a love of money

388
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,200
 because it's harmful to other people, which it is,

389
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,640
 but it's harmful to you.

390
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,240
 But you will pierce yourself with many griefs.

391
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,280
 And this verse shows it can be a real trap

392
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,000
 in which people also lose their faith.

393
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,080
 It's for our benefit more than anyone else's

394
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,880
 that we understand this.

395
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,400
 And we see this in the parable, the way Jesus lays it out.

396
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,920
 This parable is not only directed to us, but it is for us.

397
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,080
 It's for our benefit.

398
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,840
 We need this more than God does.

399
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,480
 We need to let go of our love of money

400
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,560
 much more than God needs our money to continue His ministry.

401
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,360
 And the benefit is twofold.

402
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,760
 Not only are we saved from grief caused by our love of money,

403
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,400
 but also in how we receive from our generosity.

404
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,920
 Now this message isn't even emphasising give money

405
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,240
 and then we can be able to be a blessing to others.

406
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,560
 In this parable here,

407
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,840
 the tenants of the field were blessed for sure

408
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,360
 by the discount, but the steward was really bringing

409
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,400
 about his own longer term provision.

410
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,200
 And we also will be welcomed

411
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,480
 into eternal dwelling along with others.

412
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,160
 In 2 Corinthians, it says, remember this,

413
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,760
 "Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly

414
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,640
 and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.

415
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,440
 Each of you should give what you have decided

416
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,520
 in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion

417
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,080
 for God loves a cheerful giver."

418
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,720
 The biggest beneficiary of any generosity

419
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,040
 that you may have is not the person

420
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,200
 you are generous towards.

421
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,240
 It's not God as though you were doing Him some big favour.

422
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,960
 It's you.

423
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,840
 You're the biggest beneficiary of your generosity.

424
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,960
 It's the best investment any of us can possibly make.

425
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,200
 Let's look at what Jesus says in verse nine.

426
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,520
 And I tell you, "Make friends for yourself

427
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,680
 by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails,

428
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,200
 they may receive you into eternal dwellings."

429
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,800
 A great note here as well is,

430
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,160
 how did the steward's plan work out by the way?

431
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,720
 Actually, we don't know.

432
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,040
 We don't know how the steward's plan worked out

433
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,960
 if those tenants helped him.

434
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,080
 There's no guarantee that his investment

435
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,600
 in those tenants paid off.

436
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,360
 There's no guarantee with our earthly investments.

437
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,600
 But the difference for us is that we know

438
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,800
 that Jesus can guarantee us that what we give Him

439
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,200
 and how we live for Him will seem like nothing

440
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,160
 when we are with Him in heaven.

441
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,360
 And so what is this unrighteous

442
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,920
 or in some versions, worldly wealth?

443
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,720
 The word describing the wealth

444
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,280
 is the same to use to describe the steward.

445
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,000
 Now, this is not an endorsement to attain money

446
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,080
 in whichever which way you can.

447
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,480
 But this wealth just belongs to the world.

448
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,680
 It has no righteousness to it.

449
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,680
 It doesn't come with us into heaven

450
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,800
 and it has a great potential to corrupt and destroy us.

451
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,720
 And as verse nine points out, it will fail.

452
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,680
 One way or another, even on earth, we can lose it.

453
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,080
 The steward's plan, while shrewd,

454
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,160
 doesn't guarantee his security.

455
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,640
 But even if all goes well here,

456
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,280
 our money fails in granting us eternal life.

457
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,040
 There's no amount of money we can attain

458
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,560
 that will get us eternal life.

459
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,600
 So we should use it while we are here

460
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,160
 and have it to help advance God's kingdom.

461
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,200
 And the money we are so proud to have here

462
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,480
 is as silly as monopoly money, where we are going.

463
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,920
 It's like if I had taken all my monopoly winnings

464
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,400
 to an interview for bank manager at HSBC,

465
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,640
 bragging about how I owned all the green

466
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,160
 and the dark blue and how I had hotels.

467
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,360
 And this was my credential as to why I'm so significant

468
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,920
 and will be such a great bank manager.

469
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,840
 It's laughably silly.

470
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,160
 And while that money is extremely relevant

471
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,240
 while playing the game, it's irrelevant thereafter.

472
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,760
 Now, what we have in this life is monopoly money.

473
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,640
 We are best to use it to advance the kingdom of God

474
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,560
 that we may be welcomed into eternal dwellings.

475
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,040
 All right, so how do we do this?

476
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,480
 I want to give some practical ways to do this.

477
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,040
 And as we go through, this isn't a message of guilt.

478
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,040
 I don't want you to just go away with just,

479
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,360
 "Paul told me I need to give more money."

480
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,880
 Now, that may be true.

481
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,760
 That may be true.

482
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,320
 But what is more important is we shift our understanding

483
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,320
 of money into its rightful place.

484
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,600
 A worldly thing, a potential tool,

485
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,240
 which also has tremendous ability to corrupt us,

486
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,160
 but that we can use also in advancing God's kingdom.

487
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,040
 And that we want to treat with wisdom and intentionality

488
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,880
 that we ourselves and others may benefit.

489
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,440
 So the first point is tithing.

490
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,040
 Now, I'm referring to giving of 10% to the Lord.

491
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,680
 Now, this, as Christians, to be honest,

492
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,280
 is not really generosity.

493
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,320
 This is a baseline of giving.

494
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,600
 All right, we see some verses such as in Leviticus,

495
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,480
 "A tithe of everything from the land,

496
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,360
 "where the grain from the soil or fruit from the tree

497
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,880
 "belongs to the Lord.

498
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,920
 "It is holy to the Lord."

499
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,720
 And in Deuteronomy, we see,

500
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,160
 "Be sure to set aside a tenth of all

501
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,800
 "that your fields produce each year."

502
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,000
 Now, while there is some conversation

503
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,760
 to be had around a mandate in this sense in the New Testament,

504
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,160
 the standard of generosity in the New Testament

505
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,760
 is actually much higher, requiring all of ourselves.

506
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,240
 So actually, tithing is a really great place to start

507
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,200
 if you haven't already.

508
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,080
 And there is nothing better than this

509
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,360
 for building in the habit of giving

510
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,160
 and the reminder to ourselves

511
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,520
 that all of our money and things actually belongs to God.

512
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,240
 It comes from the Lord and it belongs to Him.

513
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,680
 So then putting that back to the kingdom of God.

514
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,200
 And we often think to ourselves,

515
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,280
 "If we win the lottery

516
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,720
 "or if I just become super rich very quickly,

517
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,800
 "then I'll become super generous."

518
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,760
 But this typically isn't true.

519
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,880
 And Jesus even says this in verse 10,

520
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,960
 "Whoever can be trusted with very little

521
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,040
 "can also be trusted with much.

522
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,960
 "And whoever is dishonest with very little

523
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,200
 "also will be dishonest with much."

524
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,520
 So we need to build in giving as a habit.

525
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,080
 Now, following on from that, we get to being generous.

526
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,600
 There are countless verses on being generous.

527
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,040
 This is actually the world's easiest fact check.

528
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,160
 Just Google Bible verses about being generous

529
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,880
 and then just spend the whole night reading through.

530
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,120
 So be generous with your family and friends

531
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,760
 and with those spreading the gospel.

532
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,680
 One example being in Philippians 4,

533
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,080
 Paul commends the Philippians for helping him with his needs.

534
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,440
 And then of course, being generous with the poor.

535
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,080
 Many of these countless verses

536
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,000
 specifically mentioned helping the poor

537
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,320
 and also caring about them.

538
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,040
 Some examples, Proverbs 14, 31,

539
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,560
 "Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his maker,

540
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,040
 "but he who is generous to the needy honors him.

541
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,360
 "Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord

542
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,480
 "and he will repay him for his deed."

543
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,320
 In Deuteronomy,

544
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,240
 "For there will never cease to be poor in the land.

545
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,480
 "Therefore I command you,

546
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,400
 "you shall open wide your hands to your brother

547
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,000
 "to the needy and to the poor in your land."

548
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,920
 And in Matthew,

549
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,000
 "And the king will answer them,

550
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,560
 "Truly I say to you, as you did to the least of these brothers,

551
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,640
 "you did it to me."

552
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,480
 And on and on and on.

553
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,040
 Now imagine the favour

554
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,120
 that people would have towards the church

555
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,280
 if we live this out.

556
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,680
 And many of these verses still show

557
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,920
 that you will reap the reward for your generosity.

558
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,880
 We do actually need this reminder,

559
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,880
 not because we want to cultivate selfishness in our giving,

560
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,920
 but actually we recognize that we are weak and selfish

561
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,360
 and that we need this reminder

562
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,640
 that this is actually good for me.

563
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,400
 So it's good to remember that this is for our benefit.

564
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,360
 But the other reason we need this reminder

565
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,320
 is to keep our pride out of it.

566
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,640
 Keep our pride of saying,

567
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
 "Oh, I'm such a generous person."

568
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
 Or to even to use how generous we may be

569
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,800
 to put ourselves above others.

570
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,680
 Our goal is not to be like the Pharisee who prays,

571
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,120
 "Thank you God that I'm such a good person

572
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,040
 "and not like that tax collector.

573
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,080
 "I fast and I tithe."

574
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,880
 And also consider Matthew 6, 1,

575
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,080
 "Be careful not to practice your righteousness

576
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,440
 "in front of others to be seen by them.

577
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,920
 "If you do, you will have no reward

578
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,480
 "from your Father in heaven."

579
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,840
 Our generosity is not to become just another status symbol

580
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,280
 that we chase and idolize.

581
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,480
 And so we want to be intentional in this.

582
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,040
 Give freely, but with purpose.

583
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,840
 Look at what is effective in helping those in need.

584
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,560
 Organizations that are doing this well.

585
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,080
 We want to approach this with excellence

586
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,000
 and not just as a tick the box.

587
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,200
 We need to actually care.

588
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,120
 And lastly, I want to lay down this challenge.

589
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,760
 Plan for this.

590
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,440
 We want to grow in our wisdom

591
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
 and our intentionality in this.

592
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,000
 The steward had a plan.

593
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,800
 He thought about it and then he carried it out.

594
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,040
 Now we are actually coming up to the perfect time

595
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,480
 to do this practically.

596
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,360
 April 1st, exactly two weeks away

597
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,000
 is of course the start of the next financial year.

598
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,400
 So let's make a goal.

599
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:16,200
 So let's make a goal sometime in the course

600
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,880
 of the next two weeks to sit down and think about

601
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,400
 and go through what our lives look like financially

602
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,120
 in relation to the kingdom of God.

603
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,600
 Treat it like an audit.

604
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,200
 Treat it as though you were researching to buy a house

605
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,600
 or go on a dream holiday.

606
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,400
 Get into the nitty gritty of it.

607
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,280
 Ask, am I being a good steward?

608
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,200
 Using my money shrewdly in ways

609
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,800
 that can advance the kingdom

610
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,400
 and am I investing in my eternal dwelling?

611
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,080
 We can remember this as thinking of April 1st,

612
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,720
 not as April Fool's Day,

613
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,560
 but April Wisdom Day.

614
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,400
 - Yeah, that sounds good.

615
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,640
 - So yeah.

616
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,480
 So,

617
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,200
 though we can remember it,

618
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,280
 we can remember it.

619
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,040
 And hopefully that one will stick with you for years.

620
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,080
 So,

621
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,400
 decide on a timeframe to keep coming back

622
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,640
 and revisiting this question.

623
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,080
 This may be monthly, quarterly,

624
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,560
 or at the very least, make this annual.

625
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,000
 And make it memorable,

626
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,880
 such as the first Tuesday of each month or April 1st,

627
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,400
 which is also known to some as April Wisdom Day.

628
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,760
 (congregation laughing)

629
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,680
 If you're a family, do this together.

630
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:34,720
 And God loves when we can give joyfully.

631
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,760
 2 Corinthians says,

632
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,720
 "Each of you should give

633
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
 what you've decided in your heart to give,

634
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,320
 not reluctantly or under compulsion,

635
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,600
 for God loves a cheerful giver."

636
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,800
 So pray through this,

637
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,520
 asking for wisdom and help and guidance in this area,

638
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,520
 because it's imperative that we get this right.

639
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,640
 As we wrap up, and as the band comes back up,

640
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,440
 we need to remember God actually is much more concerned

641
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,880
 with our heart than our money.

642
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,600
 He wants us to have a heart toward the kingdom and eternity.

643
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,600
 And He knows that this is such a strong area for us

644
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,160
 where we can harden our hearts and struggle.

645
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,600
 But this is also such an effective way

646
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,880
 of pointing our hearts toward Him

647
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,520
 and surrendering to Him

648
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,200
 and for also for others to then see Him.

649
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,120
 So remember the root of why we are doing this

650
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,920
 to begin with, and what, or more accurately,

651
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,520
 who gives us that ability?

652
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,360
 It is for the one that though He was rich,

653
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,600
 for our sakes became poor,

654
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,520
 that we may become rich.

655
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,840
 He is our strength in this, and He is our reason.

656
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,920
 And it is by His grace that we are saved.

657
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,440
 We don't come from this as we are such generous people,

658
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,760
 but we follow Jesus' example,

659
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,800
 considering what He gave for us

660
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,000
 and how much greater it is what He gave for us

661
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,200
 than what is required of us.

662
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,000
 Since what we have is not really ours anyway,

663
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,760
 we're mere stewards.

664
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,280
 So let's be wise, thoughtful, and generous

665
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,240
 with how we treat our worldly wealth,

666
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,480
 not for our own glory, but for His.

667
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,320
 Let us pray.

668
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,960
 Thank you, Lord, for all You've done for us,

669
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,520
 all You've blessed us with,

670
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,560
 and all You continue to do for us, Lord.

671
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,720
 We pray, ask You now that You would protect us

672
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,200
 from the love of money and from our pride.

673
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,040
 Ask that You help us in being generous with each other

674
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,680
 and with those in need,

675
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,520
 and be generous with what You have given us.

676
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,480
 And we ask, Lord, for Your wisdom in how to deal

677
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,280
 with the wealth that we have in this world,

678
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,880
 and that You would help us to honour You

679
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,240
 with what we have.

680
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,680
 Pray this in Your name, amen.
