[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.460]   - It's so good to be back with you guys.
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.660]   And as you know, I was in Singapore.
[00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.460]   And for the beginning, I was with Pastor John
[00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.460]   at Movement Day Conference.
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.160]   Have anybody heard of Movement Day?
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.000]   Raise your hand.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.840]   Yes, several of you.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.700]   And we got to see what God was doing
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.500]   in different cities in Southeast Asia.
[00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.500]   So in Jakarta, in India, half the conference was Indian.
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500]   They're really into Movement Day.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500]   Jakarta, Singapore, Hong Kong, Pastor John,
[00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.500]   Pastor Andrew Gardner was there.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500]   And they were talking about how they were reaching
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.500]   the next generation.
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.500]   And it was an awesome time at Movement Day Conference
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.500]   in Singapore.
[00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.500]   And then we also had a conference with Winnie
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500]   and the Explorer pastors, the Explorer team there.
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500]   And we went to Heart of God Church
[00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500]   and just seeing how they do youth ministry.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500]   This church is full of thousands of young people
[00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.500]   and young people from six or seven are taking photos.
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500]   People, teens from 14 to 15 are starting
[00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.500]   to lead other Connect group leaders.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500]   And it's amazing to see this youth church
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500]   and really learn from them and see how we can grow also
[00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.500]   as a church to grow our youth and help them to grow.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.500]   Well, while I was in Singapore,
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.500]   who's been to Singapore before?
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.500]   Who's been to Singapore?
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.500]   There's a lot of you.
[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500]   There's a lot of churches there as well.
[00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.500]   And we're talking about First Corinthians,
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.500]   which is also another very important church.
[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.500]   And while I was there, we heard a couple talks about this.
[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500]   And I also was having conversations
[00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500]   with different Christians who were in Singapore.
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.500]   And a big topic that came up was different scandals
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500]   that came into the church.
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   And one of the biggest scandals that happened in the church,
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.500]   as you see in the next slide, was City Harvest Church.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.500]   City Harvest Church is one of the biggest churches
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.500]   in Singapore or was, I think they had like 10,000 people
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.500]   or something like that.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.500]   And what happened was the senior pastor,
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.500]   his name was Kong He, he had a wife that was a singer, okay?
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.500]   Or who was becoming a singer or something like that.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   And there was some sort of scandal where he took money
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   from the church and he tried to use it to support his wife
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   in her singing career.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.500]   And that blew up, right?
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.500]   And not only was the senior pastor involved,
[00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   you see all these others were also involved, right?
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.500]   Not only was a senior pastor involved,
[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.500]   another founding member was involved,
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   the secretary of the church, board members,
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.500]   financial people in the church were also involved
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   and they were all convicted.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.500]   And so this church was struggling
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   because of their leadership.
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   Their leadership was struggling with greed
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   and mishandling of money.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   And I was also talking with other people
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.500]   and some of them went to another church,
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   I think it's called New Creation Church,
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   as you see in the next slide, Joseph Prince,
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.500]   anybody heard of Joseph Prince?
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.500]   And he has a lot of people at his churches
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.500]   with a lot of different locations.
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.500]   And I was talking with one of the people
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   that went to the church and he was saying,
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.500]   "Oh yeah, this church, it's very interesting.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   "It's very rich, they have their own mega mall building."
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   They own the mall, right?
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.500]   "Very rich, they invite Hillsong
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   "and the biggest stars to come."
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.500]   But they're like, "Ah, his message,
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.500]   "a little bit suspicious at times,
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.500]   "a little bit too much prosperity
[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   "and not talking about sin,
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.500]   "focusing on grace and blessing,
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   "but doesn't talk about really
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   "that we need to repent and confess."
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.500]   And so this church, it's doing well,
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   but there's also problems.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.500]   And this is a theological issue within the church.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.500]   As we're talking about the Corinthian Church,
[00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   it also had its own problems.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.500]   And I identified three problems
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   that were really big in the Corinthian Church.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.500]   And the first one is individualism.
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500]   The second is idolatry.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.500]   And the third is immorality, immorality.
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.500]   And I've actually been to Corinth.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   Has anybody been to Corinth?
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.500]   As you see in the next slide, I've been to Corinth.
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.500]   This is my photo, I didn't take it from the internet.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.500]   And it's a lovely place.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.500]   There's a lot of rocks on top of a lot of other rocks.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   And some of these rocks have been shaped
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.500]   and it's quite beautiful.
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.500]   But when you go to a lot of these ruins,
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   former cities, Ephesus,
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.500]   at least, Leoludicea, Philadelphia,
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   you know, there's a lot of rocks.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.500]   But if you just look at rocks, there's no meaning, right?
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   You gotta sort of understand, oh, this was where
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.500]   the temple was, oh, this was where the main street was.
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.500]   And so, Pastor Michelle did a introduction.
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.500]   I'm just gonna do a brief understanding
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   of where Corinth was.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.500]   As you see in the next slide, Corinth was in,
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.500]   it's in modern day Greece, right?
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   And it's in between two pieces of land.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.500]   It's called the isthmus, right?
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.500]   The upper part and the lower part of Greece.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.500]   And it's also separated by two ports,
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   two bodies of water.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.500]   As you see in the next slide,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.500]   ships would come in from one side,
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.500]   you know, from Israel, from Egypt,
[00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.500]   they would deliver different trades.
[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   And where do you think they were going?
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.500]   Where do you think they were going?
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   To modern day Rome, right?
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.500]   Rome was the capital.
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   And so, it was dangerous to go around.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   It was dangerous to go around
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.500]   because there were many storms.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.500]   And so, what people usually did,
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.500]   what ships would usually do,
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.500]   is they would go from Egypt or Israel or wherever
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.500]   towards Corinth, and then they would drag their boat
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.500]   over to the other side.
[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.500]   It's around four miles.
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.500]   Or they would drag all their, you know,
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   the things they were carrying to the other side
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500]   and transport it to another ship
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   so that that ship would go to Rome instead.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.500]   And so, because it became a port city,
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.500]   it became very wealthy.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.500]   It charged a lot, you know, for people to stay there.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   And if boats were going around
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.500]   and the crew was, some of the crew or the merchandise
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.500]   was staying in Corinth,
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.500]   you would charge money there, right?
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.500]   It was charging taxes and money for people coming in
[00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.500]   and out of their ports.
[00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.500]   It was big on trade.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.500]   A lot of people from different kinds of backgrounds
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.500]   were coming.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   It was a cosmological, not cosmological,
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.500]   cosmetologen, is it comatol?
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   Cosmopolitan, sorry.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.500]   Sorry, my bad.
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.500]   Yeah, it was that kind of city.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.500]   And it became very wealthy.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.500]   It became very wealthy.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.500]   And it was only years later that, you know,
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.500]   some people, some of the rulers there
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.500]   dug out a canal, as you see in the next photo,
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.500]   dug out a canal for the boats to go over
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.500]   so that ships could pass more easily.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.500]   Another reason that Corinth became very rich
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.500]   was the Isthmian Games, Isthmian Games.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.500]   Now, the World Cup is coming out.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.500]   You know, that's very popular.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.500]   The Olympics is very popular.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.500]   The Olympics was more popular than the Isthmian Games.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.500]   The Isthmian Games happened every other year,
[00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.500]   similar to the games in the Olympics.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.500]   You know, I think back then they did wrestling and javelin.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   They also did other things, like singing competitions
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.500]   or I think dramas as well, something like that.
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.500]   So the Isthmian Games would be like our modern day,
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.500]   you know, the Asian Games or something like that,
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.500]   you know, prep games to prep people
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   for the Olympic Games.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.500]   And so if people came for these games,
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.500]   they would need places to stay.
[00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.500]   They would spend money, right?
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.500]   If people came and delivered their goods
[00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.500]   and their goods were passing through,
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.500]   people, boatmen, would need to stay.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.500]   And so that is why the city became more and more wealthy.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   And the people in the church,
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   some of them became more and more wealthy.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.500]   And so individualism started to become a problem.
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500]   And what do I mean by individualism?
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.500]   It's more like, oh, I am of a certain class.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.500]   I'm of a certain standard.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.500]   And if you don't meet that standard,
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.500]   well then, you know, you're not really in my crew, right?
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.500]   And that causes divisions.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.500]   And we see that in 1 Corinthians 1.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.500]   And it says here, let's read together, one, two, three.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.500]   I appeal to you, brothers and sisters.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.500]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.500]   So Paul starts this letter in chapter one,
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.500]   informing them that he's heard
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.500]   that there are people who say, I follow this person.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.500]   I follow Paul. I follow Peter. I follow Apollo, right?
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.500]   I follow Christ.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.500]   And that was because also that society,
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.500]   back then in Roman society,
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:15.500]   you were either a free or a slave, free or slave.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.500]   As you see in the next slide,
[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.500]   there were different classes of people.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500]   There was the upper class, right?
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.500]   The emperors, the senators, the aristocrats,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.500]   you know, those who could work,
[00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.500]   and those who were of the lower class,
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.500]   foreigners, slaves, gladiators.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.500]   They were of a different class.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:37.500]   It was a big segregation in the Roman culture.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.500]   And because of that,
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   a lot of the people also incorporated that into their church.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.500]   And so they started separating themselves
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.500]   from each other, right?
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.500]   Oh, I follow Paul. Paul's done this.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.500]   He started churches here, here, here.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:57.500]   My Paul is better than your Peter, right?
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.500]   And that became a problem.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.500]   They were quarreling.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.500]   And Paul continues here,
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   and he says in 1 Corinthians chapter three,
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.500]   you are still worldly,
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.500]   for since there is jealousy and quarreling among you,
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.500]   are you not worldly?
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.500]   Are you not acting like mere humans?
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.500]   For the one says, I follow Paul, I follow Apollos.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:26.500]   Paul was saying, I fed you first with milk,
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   but now you are older,
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.500]   and you should be eating solid food.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.500]   But now you are still worldly.
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.500]   You are still immature,
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:40.500]   because there's quarreling and jealousy among you.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.500]   This church was young.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.500]   It was only around three years old,
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:46.500]   according to some of the commentators.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.500]   All right, so young Christians, right?
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   A lot of them are,
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.500]   probably all of them are first generation Christians, right?
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.500]   And they grew up with this culture,
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.500]   being in the Roman culture of individualism, of classes.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.500]   And so that started to flow within the churches.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.500]   And Paul's response to this was, what did he say?
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.500]   He says this,
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.500]   "Only servants though, who you came to believe."
[00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.500]   These people are only servants who you came to believe.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.500]   "As the Lord has assigned each of them to you, to his task.
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.500]   "I planted the seed, Apollos watered it,
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.500]   "but God has made it grow."
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.500]   Why are you making a big deal of who you are following?
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.500]   All these people, Paul, Peter, Apollo,
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.500]   they're all just servants of the Lord.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.500]   All of them are just teaching about Jesus Christ ultimately,
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.500]   who you are ultimately following.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:55.500]   God has assigned these servants to help you to grow.
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.500]   We should not be focusing on the servants,
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.500]   but on Jesus Christ himself.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   This was the first sign of quarreling
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.500]   and individualism and division within the church.
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.500]   The second place that we see this
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.500]   is in the next passage that we read in chapter 11.
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.500]   Let's read this together, one, two, three.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.500]   In the first place.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.500]   (congregation chattering)
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:30.500]   "No doubt there have to be differences among you
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.500]   "to show which of you have God's approval.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.500]   "So then, when you come together,
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.500]   "it is not the Lord's Supper you eat.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.500]   "For when you are eating, some of you go ahead
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.500]   "with your own private suppers.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.500]   "As a result, one person remains hungry
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.500]   "and another gets drunk.
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.500]   "So then, my brothers, sisters,
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:55.500]   "when you gather to eat, you should all eat together.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.500]   "Anyone who is hungry should eat something at home
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.500]   "so that when you meet together,
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.500]   "it may not result in judgment."
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.500]   Who's been to a potluck before?
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:11.500]   When you go to a potluck, what is the thinking process?
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   You think about what to bring, right?
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.500]   Now, some of you, okay, let's admit it, right?
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.500]   Who are you, who of you are very generous
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.500]   and are gonna bring more?
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500]   Raise your hand.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.500]   Yeah, Charles, yeah, good, Anthony.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.500]   Okay, who is very stingy and they'll be like,
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.500]   "I'm just gonna bring the least that I can to get by."
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.500]   Who wants to admit it?
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.500]   Nobody wants to admit it, eh?
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.500]   These are the people, me?
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.500]   (laughing)
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.500]   I think Paul is saying anyone who is hungry
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.500]   should eat at home first.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.500]   So I think he was talking to me.
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.500]   So I'll eat before I come to your next
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.500]   home invited dinners, okay?
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.500]   Okay, I'm sorry, forgive me.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.500]   (laughing)
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.500]   So when you go to a potluck,
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.500]   you think about, oh, who's hosting, right?
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:01.500]   If it is Agnes and Vincent hosting,
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.500]   oh, I know they're generous.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:04.500]   They're gonna make lots of portions.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.500]   Maybe I'll just bring something small, right?
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.500]   Maybe that's what you're thinking.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.500]   Okay, maybe you're like Auntie Jackie as well.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.500]   I like to cook up something as well
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.500]   or get my helper to cook up something.
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.500]   Okay, you cook, okay, sorry, you cook.
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.500]   And so she's gonna bring a lot of food as well, right?
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.500]   But there's those who are very stingy, right?
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.500]   That who don't bring anything, right?
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.500]   And so it causes some sort of division
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.500]   or quarreling amongst them.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.500]   Now back then, they would mix some of these dinners
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.500]   with their pagan dinners or banquets, right?
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.500]   That's why Paul is saying,
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500]   some of you are getting drunk, right?
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.500]   Can you imagine, you know, having a Christmas party
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.500]   at church and people are getting drunk?
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.500]   You know, that would not happen here, right?
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.500]   But back then in the church,
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.500]   they had the Lord's Supper and that was combined
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   with some of the dinners that they were having
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.500]   and banquets that they were having
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.500]   and a lot of them were pagan
[00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.500]   and a lot of them would get drunk
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:10.500]   because they were sort of still young believers.
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.500]   And so what was happening was there were rich people
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.500]   and those who were getting richer
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:18.500]   'cause it was a port city, right?
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   A wealthy city, a lot of trade.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   Some of them were getting wealthier and wealthier
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:26.500]   and they were starting to segregate themselves
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.500]   from those who were poor.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.500]   Maybe the wealthy were like,
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.500]   oh, we're gonna have our own dinner here.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.500]   This is the wealthy dinner.
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.500]   And for those who are less wealthy,
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.500]   maybe they can just share among themselves.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:48.500]   And that caused what Paul said was divisions among you.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.500]   Divisions among you.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.500]   And food can be a sensitive topic at church.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.500]   Food can be sensitive topic sometimes.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.500]   Well, maybe not for Auntie Jackie.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.500]   She's giving a little bit.
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.500]   Sometimes food can be a sensitive topic, all right?
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.500]   And so it was at this church as well.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:15.500]   For example, if we have Alpha, right?
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.500]   And we used to have Alpha dinners.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.500]   This was before COVID and we would have
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.500]   just all these foods lined up, right?
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.500]   And some people would take plates full of food, right?
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.500]   A mountain full of food, right?
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.500]   Have you ever met anybody like that?
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.500]   They would take a mountain of food, right?
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.500]   And it was not me.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.500]   It was not me, okay?
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.500]   I'm not condemning myself.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.500]   It was not me.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.500]   So, you know, food was a sensitive topic.
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.500]   So we're like, hey, we know that you can be very hungry,
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.500]   that maybe you can save some food and then afterwards,
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.500]   once everybody's gotten enough food,
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.500]   then you can take your share, right?
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.500]   Food can be a sensitive topic.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   You know, I've been here, literally been here.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.500]   And so what about us?
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.500]   You know, back then, individualism, classes
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.500]   were a big thing, wealthy and the rich.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.500]   Back then, Jews and Gentiles, wise and fools,
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:18.500]   noble birth and not noble birth, that was a big thing.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   What about us at our church?
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.500]   You know, sometimes I hear the Explorer kids,
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.500]   they're like, oh, he goes to this school, you know,
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.500]   it's a really good school, right?
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.500]   Or, oh, they just go to local school, right?
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.500]   Sometimes we talk about it, right?
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.500]   We talk about it, but, you know,
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   it doesn't mean that in our Explorer groups,
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.500]   it doesn't mean we segregate people.
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   Oh, they go to bad schools.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.500]   Don't, don't, don't let them have their own group.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.500]   We don't do that, we don't do that.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.500]   We're one body of Christ.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.500]   Yes, you know, we'll have some downfalls
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.500]   and mistakes here and there,
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.500]   but for the most part, we are showing unity.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.500]   It doesn't matter what school you go to.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.500]   It could be a very expensive school,
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.500]   it could be a free school,
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.500]   we still accept you in Explorer, right, Winnie?
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.500]   Yes, of course, okay, very enthusiastically.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.500]   So individualism, the different classes,
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.500]   led to division.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:24.500]   And what was Paul's response?
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.500]   Well, we see that Paul's response was,
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.500]   don't follow the leader.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.500]   Don't only just follow the leader,
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.500]   follow the Lord, right?
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:37.500]   The Lord is ultimately the person
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.500]   who has placed those leaders to help you to grow
[00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:43.500]   in your church.
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.500]   And so don't focus on Peter, Paul, Apollo.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:52.500]   Focus only on what God has done.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.500]   In Ephesians chapter two, it says this,
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.500]   "But now in Christ, you who were once far away
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   "have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.500]   "For he himself is our peace,
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.500]   "who has made the two groups one,
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.500]   "and has destroyed the barrier,
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:14.500]   "dividing the wall of hostility."
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.500]   Christ died for us.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   There's no longer Jew or Gentile,
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.500]   but we are one body, family of Christ.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   Jesus has brought unity through the cross.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.500]   And so that was his message to the Corinthian church.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:36.500]   And it's a message to us today.
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.500]   Yes, you know, we're known to be a rich church, right?
[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.500]   For some of you who didn't know.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.500]   (congregation laughing)
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.500]   We're known, or our reputation is,
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:54.500]   oh, there might be a lot of people of high positions
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:57.500]   in this church as well.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.500]   Yes.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.500]   But I don't see us dividing, you know, fellowships.
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:02.500]   Are we dividing fellowships?
[00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.500]   Oh, this is the low paying grade fellowship.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.500]   This is the high paying grade.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.500]   We don't do that.
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.500]   We don't do that because we believe in this,
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.500]   that Jesus has brought unity through the cross.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.500]   And ultimately the money comes from who anyways?
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.500]   Comes from God.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.500]   It comes, it goes, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:28.500]   So individualism was the first thing that they faced,
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.500]   first problem that they faced.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.500]   The second problem that they faced was idolatry.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.500]   Idolatry.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.500]   Corinth became a hub for religious activity as well, okay?
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.500]   Religious activity from all over the world.
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:45.500]   And especially they had different temples
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.500]   to different Greek and Roman gods.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.500]   Aphrodite is the God of love.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:57.500]   Poseidon, they especially focused on Poseidon as well
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.500]   because he was the God of the sea.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   And so because Corinth was between two seaports,
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   they especially focused and paid tribute to Poseidon.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.500]   Apollos was the God of a lot of things.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   Hermes, Venus.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:17.500]   And you remember the God, the statue to worship
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:23.500]   the gods who are unknown or all the gods?
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.500]   It was also here in Corinth.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.500]   Let's read chapter 10 together.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.500]   One, two, three.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.500]   For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers,
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.500]   that our fathers were all under the cloud
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.500]   and all passed through the sea
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.500]   and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.500]   and all ate the same spiritual food
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:50.500]   and all drank from the same spiritual drink.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:54.500]   For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.500]   and the rock was Christ.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.500]   Nevertheless, the most of the God was not pleased
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.500]   for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:04.500]   Verse six.
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.500]   Now these things took place as an example for us
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.500]   that we might not desire evil as they did.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:15.500]   Do not be idolaters as some of them were.
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.500]   As it is written,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.500]   the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.500]   We should not commit sexual immorality
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:24.500]   as some of them did.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.500]   And in the day, 23,000 of them died.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:32.500]   We should not, Christ, for some of them did
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:34.500]   and were killed by snakes.
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.500]   Therefore, my beloved, flee idolatry.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.500]   All right.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   What is Paul talking about here in chapter 10?
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.500]   He's talking about the Israelites.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:52.500]   The Israelites fled and had the Exodus
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.500]   from Egypt.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.500]   And as you see in the next slide,
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.500]   after they crossed the Red Sea,
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.500]   God sent what?
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:09.500]   God sent by day the cloud, the pillar of cloud, right?
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.500]   Because in the desert, is there any shade in the desert?
[00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.500]   Not much desert.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.500]   Has anybody been to a desert before?
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   Yeah, one person.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.500]   Two, thank you.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.500]   Three, okay.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.500]   In the desert, there's no trees, right?
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.500]   And so what, and it can get very hot, right?
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.500]   If the sun is burning.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   And so God sent a pillar of cloud by the day.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.500]   So nice of the Lord, right?
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   And at night, has anybody been to the desert at night?
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.500]   Yeah, how was it at night?
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.500]   It was dark, it was cold, right?
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:48.500]   And so God gave a pillar of fire at night.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.500]   Wow, they could warm up.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.500]   They could see where they're going.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.500]   God is so good.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.500]   God provided everything they needed.
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.500]   God provided what from the sky for them to eat.
[00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.500]   What did they provide?
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.500]   Manna, bread from heaven, right?
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:11.500]   But the problem was, in verse six, Paul says this,
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.500]   "Now these things took place as an example for us,
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.500]   "that we might not desire evil as they did
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.500]   "or lust as they did."
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.500]   What did Israel lust after?
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.500]   God took care of all of them.
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:31.500]   Provided cloud, provided the fire.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:36.500]   God provided manna, but what, they were not satisfied.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.500]   What did they want?
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.500]   They wanted meat.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.500]   Who's a meat lover here?
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:43.500]   Yeah, you guys are all guilty, I'm joking.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.500]   God provided quail, I think it was quail, for them.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:55.500]   And it flew around them and they could just eat it, right?
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:00.500]   They were not satisfied with what the Lord had given them.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.500]   They lusted after meat.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.500]   And not only did they lust after meat, what did they do?
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.500]   They had a golden calf, right?
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.500]   They wanted something physical.
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.500]   Oh, we haven't seen God for days.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.500]   Oh, we haven't seen Moses for days.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.500]   I don't know where they are.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.500]   They're up in Mount Sinai, worshiping God.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.500]   We can't see them anymore.
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:24.500]   We want something that we could physically see and worship,
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.500]   just like the other nations.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:32.500]   And they had a golden calf and they worshiped it.
[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.500]   And that's why Paul quotes here,
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   "The people sat down and eat and drank and rose up to play."
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.500]   They started to incorporate idolatry into their worship.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:51.500]   The Corinthian church was also dealing with idolatry
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.500]   and they were also dealing with meat.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.500]   Where would they get their meat?
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:02.500]   A lot of them got their meat sacrificed to idols, okay?
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.500]   They ate meat that were sacrificed to idols
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.500]   and Paul specifically spends some chapters
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   to talk about this, how it is affecting their faith,
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.500]   affecting their church.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:22.500]   And so we see a comparison between Israel and Corinth.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.500]   God provided manna and deliverance for Israel.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.500]   God also provided wealth and prosperity
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:33.500]   for the city in Corinth and this church was also prospering.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.500]   Israel drank from the rock, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:43.500]   Corinth has been saved by the rock of salvation, Jesus Christ.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.500]   The problem with Israel was they lusted after flesh,
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:50.500]   meat, fleshly desires.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.500]   Corinth also desired meat sacrificed to idols.
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   They fell into idolatry. Israel fell into idolatry.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:07.500]   Corinth was falling into idolatry.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.500]   They were incorporating the different gods
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.500]   and the different worships of those gods into the church
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:18.500]   and meat sacrificed to idols was being eaten
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.500]   by some of them in the church as well.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:26.500]   They mixed idolatry into God's worship
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:30.500]   and ultimately there was punishment.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:37.500]   Idolatry leads ultimately to death, spiritual death.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.500]   And God punished them.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.500]   How many did he say died in the desert?
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   23,000 of them died.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.500]   How come?
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.500]   They were blessed by God.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.500]   God provided for them.
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   How come they died?
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:01.500]   Because they did not obey the Lord.
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:03.500]   They followed their flesh.
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.500]   They followed idols.
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:12.500]   And that was Paul's warning to the church in Corinth.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:14.500]   God has blessed you.
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.500]   God has blessed this city.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:23.500]   But you must be careful to flee from idolatry
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:29.500]   because idolatry will lead to spiritual death.
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:32.500]   What about us?
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.500]   What about us?
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:39.500]   What are some of the idols that are in Hong Kong?
[00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:41.500]   Big idols?
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.500]   Money?
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.500]   Mirror? Oh, mirror.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.500]   Yeah, mirror. Yeah.
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.500]   We won't be singing mirror.
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.500]   I don't think our worship team will be singing mirror anytime soon.
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:00.500]   Greed is a big one.
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.500]   Okay, Rolex, we're getting very specific.
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.500]   Rolex.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.500]   It's not wrong to buy a Rolex.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.500]   But okay, in general, greed, money, right?
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.500]   Fame or status, right?
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.500]   These things are very big idols in our city.
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:23.500]   And so we must be careful not to make these things
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.500]   idols in our lives and also in our churches.
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:30.500]   And so that is a warning to us.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.500]   And I looked up some things.
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:39.500]   One commentary had this, "Signs our church has fallen to the world.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:44.500]   "Teaching the Bible is not inspired and inerrant."
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.500]   Do we teach that the Bible is not inspired and inerrant?
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.500]   Do we teach that?
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.500]   No, we don't. No, we don't.
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.500]   Somebody might have been confused.
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.500]   Okay?
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:01.500]   A sign that a church has fallen is that we start teaching
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:05.500]   that there is more than one way to God besides Jesus.
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.500]   Do we teach that there is more than one way?
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.500]   No, we don't.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.500]   There's only one way.
[00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.500]   The way, the truth, and the life.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   And He is Jesus.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.500]   Being embarrassed to say that Jesus is the only way to salvation.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.500]   Are we embarrassed?
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.500]   No, we are not embarrassed.
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.500]   Teaching that there's no absolute right or wrong.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.500]   Does our church say that there's no absolute right or wrong?
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.500]   If you feel it's okay for you, then it's okay for you.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.500]   Do we teach that?
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.500]   We do not.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:40.500]   We believe that the moral compass is God.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:43.500]   And He has taught us through the Bible.
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:48.500]   He teaches us through the Bible what is absolutely right and wrong.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.500]   He is the moral law maker.
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.500]   Condemning the society of sins.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.500]   Condemning the society of sins.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.500]   Not condemning the society of sins.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.500]   Is another sign that the church has fallen to the world.
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.500]   I think we're okay.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:12.500]   Let's stay strong and focused on the Lord.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.500]   Individualism.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.500]   Idolatry.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:22.500]   And the third thing that this church was facing was immorality.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.500]   Sexual immorality.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:32.500]   Now, as you see the next slide, the temple of love, of Aphrodite's,
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.500]   was actually on the mountain.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.500]   So Corinth was split into two.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:40.500]   Sort of two places, right?
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.500]   There was Corinth, the main city here.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.500]   And then there was the Acro-Corinth, which is the upper Corinth.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.500]   And if the city was attacked, they could easily abandon the city
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.500]   and flee to the mountains where it was safer and easier to defend.
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.500]   And on top of the mountain, well, on top of the mountain,
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.500]   there was a temple of Aphrodite's.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.500]   And that was the temple of, do you guys know?
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   Of love, okay?
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.500]   And it was said that there was over a thousand prostitutes
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:14.500]   where you could go and pay tribute and offer yourselves to this God.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:20.500]   And so the word Corinthentize, I'm sorry, I'm saying it wrong,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:26.500]   but it became synonymous with sexual immorality.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.500]   This city became the Las Vegas of its day.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:36.500]   What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, right?
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.500]   You don't say this about Ocean Park, right?
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.500]   I hope not.
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:48.500]   Corinth became a center for sexual immorality.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.500]   People, especially who were traveling, had nothing to do,
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.500]   didn't have to go home, didn't have responsibilities.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:57.500]   They were free. Let's have night of fun and party.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.500]   Let's go meet some people.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.500]   And these prostitutes, it was said that they would come down
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:06.500]   at night from the temple into the city to seek people
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:11.500]   who wanted to also pay tribute.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:16.500]   Corinthian church was also dealing with this.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.500]   Let's read together chapter six.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.500]   We'll read some of it.
[00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   One, two, three.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   "No, you yourselves."
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   [audience talking]
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.500]   "Adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves,
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:48.500]   nor coveters, nor drunkards, nor revealers, nor extortioners
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.500]   will inherit the kingdom of God.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.500]   And such were some of you, but you were washed,
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.500]   but you were sanctified, but you were justified
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:02.500]   in the name of the Lord Jesus, in the spirit of God."
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.500]   Some of them thought, "Oh, I've been cleansed in the inside
[00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.500]   by the Lord Jesus.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.500]   So the things I commit outside the body, it doesn't matter."
[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.500]   That was some of the thinking.
[00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.500]   And Paul says that in chapter six.
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.500]   The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality,
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.500]   but for the Lord.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.500]   Sexual immorality, the definition of that
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.500]   is sex outside of marriage.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.500]   God has gifted humanity with sex,
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   but within the confines of marriage.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:43.500]   And anything outside of that is sexual immorality.
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   And so the Corinthians were sometimes thinking this.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.500]   "Oh, I've been saved, my inner self.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   You know, God has saved my soul.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:55.500]   That's all that matters.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.500]   The things I commit on the outside of my body,
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:58.500]   it doesn't matter."
[00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.500]   No, Paul says, your body is the temple of God.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:09.500]   When you do these things to your body, it defiles your body.
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.500]   You become impure.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:18.500]   And so immorality, sexual immorality,
[00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:23.500]   leads to defilement, leads to defilement.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.500]   And this was one of the things
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.500]   that the Corinthian church dealt with,
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:33.500]   because that was their culture.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.500]   It was a big thing back then.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.500]   And so what about us?
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   Maybe we have impurity of our speech.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.500]   Maybe we're gossiping,
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   maybe we're talking down on people.
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.500]   Maybe we have impurity of conduct.
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.500]   We don't show love.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.500]   Instead, we're showing hatred.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.500]   Maybe in our secret life,
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.500]   we're falling into sexual immorality.
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.500]   And thank God,
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.500]   our church does not practise sexual immorality at church.
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.500]   I think that's some of the things
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.500]   that they were dealing with.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.500]   Some of the brothers in the church,
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.500]   some of them married their father's wife.
[00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:29.500]   That was something that Paul specifically mentioned.
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.500]   Don't associate with these people, right?
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.500]   We need to rebuke them.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.500]   And if they confess,
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.500]   help them to be restored in the faith.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.500]   And so what about us?
[00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.500]   Maybe we have impurities of different kinds.
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.500]   It could be in our speech,
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.500]   it could be in our conduct,
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.500]   it could be in our private life.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   We need Jesus to cleanse us on a daily basis.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   So let's recap here.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   The first thing that they faced,
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.500]   individualism led to division in this church.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   Idolatry led to spiritual death,
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.500]   led them towards physical death and punishment as well
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.500]   from the Lord.
[00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.500]   Immorality leads to defilement.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:25.500]   And what is the solution to this?
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   Jesus is the solution.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.500]   Jesus died for all of us.
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   Jews, Gentiles, wealthy, poor, right?
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.500]   High positions, lowly positions.
[00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.500]   God has died for all of us.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:51.500]   We are all joined together by the blood of Christ.
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.500]   The answer to idolatry
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.500]   is to let go of our idols
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.500]   and recognize that only Jesus saves.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.500]   Our money is not going to save us.
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:11.500]   Going after relationship to relationship to relationship
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.500]   is not going to save us ultimately.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:17.500]   Ultimately, it's a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.500]   that saves us.
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.500]   Looking after status and looking good on the outside
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.500]   is not going to save us.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:31.500]   Eventually, our bodies are gonna be old and wear away.
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:36.500]   Only Jesus saves.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:41.500]   And the last thing is Jesus purifies.
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:44.500]   Jesus purifies.
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.500]   We need Jesus to purify our lips,
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   the things that we talk about.
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:53.500]   We need Jesus to purify our actions.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.500]   We need Jesus.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.500]   We need Jesus to purify our minds.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.500]   Humility.
[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.500]   I have three H's to help us today as a church.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.500]   Humility.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.500]   We need to be humble like Jesus.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.500]   How was Jesus humble?
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:18.500]   He left his throne in heaven to be with us, to be with you.
[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:22.500]   He left his throne to be with us.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.500]   Jesus was humble.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:31.500]   The second thing we need to do is halt, stop.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:37.500]   Stop the things that we're doing that are not pleasing to the Lord.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:42.500]   What is becoming an idol in your life?
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.500]   Is it a person?
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.500]   Is it wealth?
[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.500]   What is it?
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.500]   Sometimes it could be good things too, right?
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:56.500]   But if you start idolizing those good things,
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.500]   it's not a good thing.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.500]   It becomes something of an idol.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.500]   So we must be careful.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.500]   The last thing is holiness.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.500]   Be holy for our Lord is holy.
[00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:16.500]   Holy is being set apart from the world.
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.500]   The Lord wants our church to be humble.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:26.500]   To stop any idols that come in our church
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:31.500]   and to be holy and pleasing to the Lord.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.500]   We need Jesus.
[00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.500]   Let's just take a moment right now as the band comes up
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:45.500]   just to come before the Lord in repentance.
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.500]   What are some of the things that the Lord places on our heart
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.500]   that we've fallen short of the Lord?
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.500]   Maybe it's our speech.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.500]   Our speech has been impure.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.500]   Maybe it's our thoughts.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.500]   Maybe we've looked down on others.
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:12.500]   And these things can affect our church as well.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.500]   Let us flee from sin, flee from immorality,
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:22.500]   flee from idolatry, flee from the divisions
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.500]   caused by individualism.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:31.500]   Let us take some time to repent before the Lord now and confess.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:40.500]   And after a minute we will rise and respond in song.
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.500]   Let's take that moment now.
