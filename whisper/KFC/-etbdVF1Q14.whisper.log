[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Okay, it's wonderful to be here with you.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.540]   I'm just gonna take a while, get organized here.
[00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.680]   Flip this off and just to say what an honor it is
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.000]   to be with you tonight and to hear John.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.880]   John looked like he was having a good time on the beach,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.520]   but it looked a bit cold to me.
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.620]   If I go to the beach, I like to be a little warmer than that.
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.520]   So anyway, it's great to be here.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.160]   I was trying to, Mary and I were trying to remember
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.200]   the last time we were here,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.560]   but it was within the first couple of years of the church.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.560]   And just to see the impact that Kung Fu Church International
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.800]   and Kung Fu Church have had together
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.800]   on the one movement all across Hong Kong is really inspiring.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.680]   So it's an honor to be here.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.880]   And I guess tonight really my hope is that I can come
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.920]   and together we can encourage one another
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.480]   to keep joining together.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.640]   If there are any divisions among us in the city,
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.860]   if there's any divisions among us in our workplaces,
[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.640]   if there's any divisions among us in the church,
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.840]   that those we can overcome with this heart
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.060]   of bridge building.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.440]   So that's my desire tonight.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.700]   And thank you for that prayer, Michelle.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.520]   Thank you for praying for us.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.120]   And so Michelle kicked off the series last week
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.860]   with identifying what are the main issues
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.880]   that are in 1 Corinthians.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.800]   And my job is to kind of then step into that.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.280]   I think the official title was party spirit,
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.280]   but it's basically looking at the different divisions
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.420]   that can rise up among us.
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.960]   As Michelle said, or as we were talking,
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.960]   I came here to Hong Kong to be a senior pastor
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.180]   at Community Church.
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.880]   Before that, we were pastoring churches in the UK
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.520]   and also in Germany.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.840]   And so for about 22 years, I've been a pastor.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.840]   And at one of those churches, we designed a little booklet.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.800]   And this booklet was called
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.120]   "How to Resolve Conflict in a Biblical Fashion."
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.920]   So how to resolve conflict in a biblical fashion.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.120]   And the very first sentence of this booklet was,
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.120]   "It is normal when we are together to experience conflict."
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.040]   And the booklet was very well received.
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.720]   And so we thought, this is well received,
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.720]   so we're gonna go ahead and put it up on our webpage.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.920]   And so we did that.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.840]   And then somehow in the mysteries of Google,
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.120]   which I don't fully understand,
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.760]   Google took it and took that phrase
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   that when it is normal when we are together
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.980]   to have conflict, put that next to our church name,
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.120]   and that's how people identified us.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.880]   It was, here we are, come to our church.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.440]   It is normal when we are together to have conflict.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.120]   Okay, not very good marketing,
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.880]   but it is kind of normal, right?
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.740]   It is normal when people are together
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.180]   that over time we can expect some conflict
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.760]   because people are messy, right?
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.560]   And I'm one of them.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.200]   And as we get into relationships,
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.600]   sometimes those relationships can get messy.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.000]   And that's what Michelle was identifying last week
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.480]   in her second point of the ministry of Paul
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.360]   was that there was a call from Paul for unity.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.320]   There was a call from Paul to come together
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.200]   and to overcome these groups.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.640]   So what I'm gonna do tonight is basically
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.200]   just look at what that might look like
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.680]   to go a little bit deeper in that area.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.720]   And I'd like to do that really by looking at three words.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.840]   I think we're there.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.520]   Oops.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.760]   You definitely do not want me to sing to you.
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.840]   So maybe we can go to the slides and then we can look at it.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.720]   If we could go to that first slide, the title slide.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.560]   But basically we're gonna look at these three words.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.960]   The three words when they come up are basically tribe.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.280]   And then we're gonna look at priest.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.480]   And then after priest, we're gonna look at
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.040]   what does it mean for the heart?
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.280]   So those are the three words we're gonna use
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.280]   to look at this question of the heart of a servant.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.320]   Good, so here we are.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.360]   So tribe, priest, and heart.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.720]   So I wanna read to you a little bit.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.760]   This is not like a bedtime reading or anything like that.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.240]   But I wanna read to you a little bit
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.200]   from an author named Amy Chua.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.240]   Do you know Amy Chua?
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.600]   Does that ring a bell at all?
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.560]   Amy Chua is at Yale.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.240]   She's part of their legal, part of their law school there.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.280]   She's written these amazing academic books,
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.680]   but she's best known for a book called "Tiger Mom."
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.360]   And this is not "Tiger Mom."
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.920]   I'm not gonna read from "Tiger Mom."
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.040]   But about four years ago, 2018,
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.840]   she became very concerned about all of the groups
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.000]   that were forming in our world.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.180]   And she became very concerned about the polarization,
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.680]   not only in the US, but around the world.
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.680]   So she wrote a book about tribes.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.360]   And this is how that book starts.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.040]   It says, "Humans are tribal.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.840]   "We need to belong to groups.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.540]   "We crave bonds and attachments,
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.340]   "which is why we love clubs and teams
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.640]   "and fraternities and family.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.720]   "Almost no one is a hermit.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.640]   "Even monks and friars belong to orders.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.640]   "But the tribal instinct is not just an instinct to belong.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:48.260]   "It also is an instinct to exclude.
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:54.580]   "The tribal instinct is not only an instinct to belong,
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.780]   "but it's an instinct to exclude."
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.100]   Now, hear how Paul starts his section that we read tonight.
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.040]   For when one says, "I follow Paul,"
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.240]   and another says, "I follow Apollo,"
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.920]   are you not mere humans?
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.400]   Or in the other translation, human beings.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.560]   In other words, there's an instinct, right?
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.880]   And I recognize that instinct in me.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.840]   When I was reading this,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.480]   I follow Paul, I follow Apollos,
[00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.260]   kind of made me think about some years ago
[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.640]   when we went to visit New York City.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.880]   And I was so excited to go to New York City
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.520]   to hear Tim Keller preach in person, right?
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.960]   So I thought, "This is gonna be great."
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.280]   So much so that one of our oldest daughter
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.680]   was kind of thinking I was like a fangirl or something,
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.120]   like, "Timmy, I'm gonna hear him," right?
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.880]   But it was exciting, right?
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.720]   And I recognize that in me.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.060]   But I know that Timmy, or Tim Keller,
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.060]   is at his best when he is pointing people to Jesus Christ.
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.500]   And he's often, if not almost always,
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.020]   at his best as he does that.
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.740]   But there's something in us, right?
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.740]   There's something in us that wants to group together,
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.100]   which is not bad.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.380]   Michelle did a great job kind of laying this out last week
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.660]   about unity and diversity.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.300]   But to have groups is not always bad, right?
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.820]   One of my colleagues at the university,
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.140]   he loves durian, right?
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.840]   I, on the other hand,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.000]   well, it's not my favorite, right?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.020]   But we get along fine.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.660]   Hope I didn't offend any durian lovers in here or whatever.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.780]   But yeah, that's just, it doesn't really matter, right?
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.560]   It's not a group that matters.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.100]   But there are other groups
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:55.460]   where then it begins to be divisive.
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.980]   It begins to be exclusive.
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.180]   My mom had a gift of hospitality.
[00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.380]   And growing up, we had a big table.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.700]   And the whole, the phrase that we would hear
[00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.740]   again and again from her is,
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.100]   "There's always room for one more at the table."
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:16.380]   But see, there's some groups which says,
[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.420]   "You can't sit at this table."
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.740]   And when the groups become divisive like that,
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.460]   when the groups become exclusive,
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.140]   and we say, "You, because of who you are,
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.980]   "are not welcomed here,"
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:36.940]   then we begin to fall into what Paul is addressing here,
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.000]   the group of Apollos, the group of Paul.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.380]   And sometimes we even add colors to them, don't we?
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.420]   And we begin to give colors like blue and like yellow
[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.420]   and like red and like black and like green
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.220]   and like white.
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:01.420]   And we give these colors to these groups.
[00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:04.960]   And then it becomes divisive.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.620]   And it becomes exclusive.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:12.700]   And then the oneness, the unity,
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.100]   which we talked about last week, begins to fall apart.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.780]   That's what I'm gonna talk about tonight,
[00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.780]   is to focus on that because it's not only out there, right?
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   We know it to be in the church.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.320]   We know it to always be a design of the devil
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.440]   to try to create different groups in a church.
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.640]   So we're always on guard,
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.040]   as Paul was on guard saying, "This is Apollos."
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.120]   Okay, so is that clear?
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.000]   That's kind of where we're gonna be addressing.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.800]   And we're gonna be talking right at it.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.960]   That was the tribes.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   But in the tribes, then there is a work to be done
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.120]   to be done.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.920]   There's a work that we can do within the church.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.080]   And in this area, then we come to look at the priests,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.540]   the priest role.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.440]   So the work that we do is of the priest.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.920]   And here we need to let Scripture interpret Scripture, right?
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.320]   Because Paul is talking about this division.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   And then he says, "There is a work that we do,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.720]   "for we are God's fellow workers," he's saying.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.000]   Now, take a moment and just kind of breathe that in
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.040]   a little bit, right?
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.920]   To be a fellow worker of God.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.580]   Okay, so think about your work.
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:39.880]   And to imagine that you are working alongside of God.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.720]   The Greek word here is syn-ergo,
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.080]   which is literally working together with God.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.800]   Not just doing work for God
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.160]   and calling on His help occasionally,
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.080]   but to be working alongside God.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.840]   This is the work that we're called to.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.560]   Now, to make this teaching really practical,
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.960]   what I'd like you to do is to imagine with me.
[00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.720]   Maybe not imagine, but just think with me for a little bit
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.760]   about divisive groups that you know.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:18.320]   Maybe they're in your workplace.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.680]   Maybe there's two groups.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.080]   Before I became a pastor,
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.820]   I was in marketing with Accenture.
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.820]   There was always the marketing and the finance,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.480]   because marketing wanted to spend a lot of money,
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.920]   finance didn't, and that's kind of how that worked.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.060]   Maybe groups in your workplace.
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.400]   Are there two groups there?
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.840]   Maybe they're groups among your student groups.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.720]   Maybe they're groups in your family.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:44.700]   Maybe they're groups in the church.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.720]   And just think about that for a moment.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.280]   Does everybody have something in mind?
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.120]   Yeah?
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.320]   This is kind of a hard sermon for a Saturday night, isn't it?
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.440]   I mean, it's like, wow, okay.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.800]   I want you to have that in mind,
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.520]   because then I think we can apply the word of God to it,
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.880]   and we can apply the work of the priest.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.960]   So then we have to ask ourselves,
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.960]   if we are God's fellow workers, what is the work we do?
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.920]   And the work we do is the work of the priest.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.240]   We are called to be priests.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.840]   Peter, one of the best friends of Jesus,
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.080]   said you are called, you are a royal priesthood,
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.400]   you are a holy priesthood.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.740]   The reformers said the priesthood of all believers.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.000]   You may have heard the priesthood
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.380]   of all believers quite a lot.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:36.100]   You may have said that about yourself,
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:37.920]   but what is the work of the priest?
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.640]   And that's what we're gonna look at now.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.640]   Pontifex is the Latin for priest.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.880]   This is a Saturday night,
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:50.480]   so it's great to have Latin on a Saturday night, right?
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.280]   So my mom, in addition to being very hospitable,
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.200]   also loved Latin.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.720]   Latin was one of her passions.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.840]   There was really no problem that was too big
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.800]   that could not be solved with Latin in her mind, right?
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.080]   But pontifex means priest.
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.920]   That's what you are.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.760]   If you say you're the priesthood of believers,
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.760]   you're a pontifex.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.400]   And what is a pontifex?
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   Ponte is bridge, fex is to make, facer, to make.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.200]   It's basically that's what we are.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.560]   That's your work.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.660]   That's my work.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:25.340]   Maybe a bad news is there's tribes out there.
[00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.780]   The good news is that we are a tribe of bridge builders.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.040]   That's what we do.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:34.480]   We come as priest and we begin to build bridges.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.040]   We begin to look at what does it mean
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.560]   to build the bridges together.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.920]   So think about bridges.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.760]   What is a bridge, right?
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.360]   Think about Stonecutter Bridge or Singma Bridge.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.460]   What does a bridge do?
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.080]   It connects.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.040]   What does it connect?
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:59.160]   Yeah, it connects one thing to another, right?
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.240]   It's two points.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.040]   Often one side of a river to another side of the river,
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.840]   one to whatever, a chasm.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.260]   It's a bridge that brings things together.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.560]   That's what a bridge does, right?
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.560]   Okay, you still have that image of that group in your mind
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.640]   that were apart?
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.320]   What does a bridge look like connecting those?
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.040]   Or let's be a little bit more specific.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.920]   What do you look like as a bridge maker
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.600]   connecting those two?
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.320]   What would that look like to be a bridge builder
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.280]   in that area and to begin to build bridges,
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.600]   to connect people, to do the priestly work
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.100]   that Christ himself came to do?
[00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:41.880]   Jesus was the ultimate bridge builder, right?
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.440]   Because he connected us with the Father.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.720]   He came into the gap and filled that gap vertically.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.360]   And that's what we can do.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.440]   As bridge builders, we can build vertical bridges
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.900]   to God for others and build them so strong and so safe
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.000]   that people can feel they can want
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.400]   to go into the arms of God.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.400]   But we can also build horizontal bridges.
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:06.680]   And we can begin to build into these groups.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.640]   So there's no longer groups, but they're connected.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.720]   And the people are traveling back and forth on that groups.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.560]   That is what you and I are called to do.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.200]   This is what we do as a group.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.640]   We are doing this work together.
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:24.740]   So this is the bridge builder.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.720]   This is the work we do.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.260]   But as we go on, I wanna talk to you a little bit
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.680]   about a bridge building that we've been a part of, okay?
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.560]   Because this is a picture.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.560]   See if I can get out of the way here.
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.000]   It's actually quite big here.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.240]   But you can see this picture.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.880]   This is a Lead for Life program.
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:44.080]   This is what we work on at Faith and Global Engagement.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.360]   It's an area that I work in.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.400]   It's a character leadership program.
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.400]   We have 200, basically 249 students in this cohort,
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.600]   and we have about 180 in the first one.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.700]   So over 400 students involved in two cohorts.
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.360]   We also have 84 mentors.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.240]   This happened last Sunday night.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.480]   So this just happened as we launched this off.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.280]   Now, the reason I wanted to show you this
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.640]   is there's a traditional conflict
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.920]   or a grouping called town gown.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.280]   You heard of that?
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.600]   Right, just town gown.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.320]   So right from the beginning,
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.640]   Oxford starting up in the universities,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.800]   there was always tension where there was a university
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.660]   and there was a town.
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.960]   So much so that historians called it
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.640]   the town gown conflict, right?
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.200]   We've experienced that here in Hong Kong
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.360]   at different times, right?
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.160]   Conflict sometimes between what's going on
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.640]   in the universities and what's going on in the town.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.120]   Groups.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.400]   And so one of the things we wanted to do
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.920]   at Lead for Life and its character leadership
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.000]   is to say, let's bring both together.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.380]   The gowns are pretty obvious here, right?
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.340]   These are our students,
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.880]   and the students come from every faculty
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.160]   in University of Hong Kong.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.160]   But the 84 mentors are leaders in all different categories,
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.360]   all different sectors in Hong Kong,
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.200]   and they volunteer to come in
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   and to come alongside our students for one year.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.360]   And then the mentors get,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:19.440]   and then the students stay together for another year,
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.880]   and they get another two set of mentors.
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.560]   The student group will stay together all four years.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.880]   It's just our kind of little way
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.760]   of trying to bridge a gap.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.500]   This is the mentor group,
[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.960]   and you can barely see our mentor right here, right?
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.640]   You can just barely see the top of his head,
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.720]   but this is the group.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.720]   The group is called Curiosity.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.360]   This is the mentee group.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.160]   And I love it how you can barely see the mentor
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.640]   because that's the purpose, right?
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.300]   The purpose is that we see the students.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.760]   This is something that I wanted to give you
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.480]   as just a small example of pontifex,
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.620]   of bridge building, of trying to do what we can.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.080]   So what does yours look like?
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:06.680]   What does yours look like as you begin to think
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.600]   about how I would build that bridge
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.520]   between these two groups,
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.140]   and what would be some steps we could take,
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.320]   and who you're going to do it with, right?
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.240]   Because this is not done by one person.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.680]   This is done by a team.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.320]   And when you build bridges,
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.220]   you work together to build those teams.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.960]   Now, when we do this, we're coming on to the third word.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:33.960]   Okay, but before I go on, is this making sense, right?
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.280]   Or is this following?
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:39.040]   So, okay, we've got groups, right?
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:41.640]   And then we need to bring those groups together
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:42.800]   because that's who we are.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.120]   We're the priesthood of believers.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.280]   That's our job.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.800]   It's a family business, really.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.240]   The father was a bridge builder, right?
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.600]   And he gave to the son to be the bridge builder
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.800]   in terms of Jesus Christ,
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.240]   and has been passed on generation,
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.520]   and generation, and generation.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.720]   And now this whole room,
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.600]   we're filled with bridge builders, right?
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.260]   And so, what does it mean to do that?
[00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.960]   Now, before we go on,
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:08.280]   I'm just gonna give you this example
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.360]   to maybe kind of help us kind of see
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.480]   where we are in reflecting.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.720]   Because what we're doing right now
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.520]   is we're doing the tough work
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.780]   of we're addressing potential issues or real issues
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.520]   in our work, in our families,
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.960]   maybe in our churches and in our friend group, right?
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.040]   But we're reflecting on it.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.840]   Now, at the Lead for Life group,
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.800]   we've got this amazing head of research.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.940]   He's also the project manager
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.840]   for Faith and Global Engagement, Hua Lun.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.800]   And he does the reflection of how to reflect.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.200]   And this is a good model.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.040]   If you're thinking about
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.760]   how I wanna reflect on a scripture passage,
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.420]   how I wanna reflect on a problem,
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.960]   how I wanna reflect on really anything,
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.980]   this is kind of an iceberg metaphor to do that, right?
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.620]   So the very top of this is a hmm.
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.380]   And when Hua Lun teaches us this,
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.620]   he basically has us all do it together, right?
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.860]   So he says, first of all, we go hmm,
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.780]   that's interesting, right?
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.180]   That's what the hmm means.
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.860]   That means you come across something
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.760]   and you think hmm, that's interesting.
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.460]   Hmm, that's interesting that humans
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.200]   seem to have an instinct for tribalism.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.840]   Hmm, that's interesting, right?
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.320]   But we don't stop there, right?
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.320]   Because we've gotta go a little bit further down.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:29.200]   And then we go to the ah.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.040]   You guys are really good.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.680]   I'm gonna bring you over to the campus
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.680]   and have you guys do this.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.040]   So we go to the ah.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.380]   And ah means ah, that's useful.
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.600]   Bridge building, I'm a bridge builder.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.240]   That's useful, I can build bridges.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.320]   That's useful, ah.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.360]   That's where we are right now in this sermon,
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.520]   just so we're tracking in.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.040]   But you can see that we've really
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.600]   only stayed at the surface level.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.360]   And now we need to go down to this big part.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.200]   Now don't get scared.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.940]   It's not like the rest of the sermon is much bigger.
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.440]   But now we need to go deeper.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:11.760]   Now we go to the ah-ha.
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.760]   Right, and you know that?
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.100]   You know that's an ah-ha moment, right?
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:21.100]   So we go from the hmm to the ah-ha.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:28.240]   Means this is relevant for me.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.680]   Means there's something in here for me.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:36.100]   This is interesting, it's useful, but it's for me.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.640]   That's why it's the heart.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.560]   So you guys ready to go a little deeper?
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.720]   Okay, so we're gonna go a little bit deeper
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.560]   because now we're actually looking at really what matters.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:56.020]   Jesus said out of the heart flows what a person is, right?
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.420]   The mouth speaks overflow of what is out of the heart.
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.820]   Jesus was always looking at the heart.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.480]   When the groups, and he dealt with groups
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.780]   from the Pharisees to the Sadducees to the Essenes,
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.420]   and when he dealt with those groups,
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.440]   he said, it was often said, he knew their heart, right?
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.680]   So that's where we're going.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.820]   We're going down to the heart.
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.340]   And this is what Paul says.
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.740]   He's just finished talking about himself as a leader,
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.300]   and he's saying, don't follow me, follow Jesus Christ,
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.580]   because then he says, what after all is Apollos,
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.040]   and what is Paul?
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.240]   We're only servants.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.900]   Okay, now we're getting down to the identity of who we are.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:44.560]   Now we're getting down to, do we have the heart of a servant?
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:50.160]   Do we want to build that bridge?
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.080]   Do we want to make that connection?
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.800]   Are we willing to serve?
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.160]   And then when we look at the heart of the servant,
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.160]   we begin to ask a question,
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.480]   what is the heart of a servant, right?
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.960]   So again, it's a problem.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.160]   So every good problem can be solved with Latin.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.100]   So now we're back to this, and I promise,
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.160]   this is the last Latin in the whole,
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:18.160]   but humility is the characteristic
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.000]   of a heart of a servant.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.120]   But what is humility?
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.720]   It comes from this humilis, it comes from the ground,
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.520]   it comes from dirt, really.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.540]   Not that we are treated ourselves like dirt,
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.320]   but we are grounded.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.320]   We are so grounded, we are not swayed by every wind
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.120]   of what people think about us,
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.640]   because we know who we are.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.920]   We take in the tradition our rightful space.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.060]   We don't take more, or that would be arrogance.
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:48.600]   We don't take less, or that would be not grateful to God.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.320]   But we are grounded as servants.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   We have this humus, we have this groundedness to us.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.820]   But then there's something else, because there's a core.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:03.080]   That's the heart, that's the Latin for heart.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.720]   So we have a humble heart, but the heart itself
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.200]   is where we get the word courage.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.120]   So what's in your heart as a bridge builder?
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:17.380]   And do we have that humility, and do we have that courage?
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:23.820]   Because we need both if we're gonna be bridge builders,
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.000]   because we need the humility to recognize
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.960]   there is a problem, and we also need to have the humility
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.300]   to recognize that I may be part of that problem.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.400]   But then we need the courage to act.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.300]   It's wisdom is applied knowledge.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.960]   We can know it and not do anything,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.360]   but we need that courage, right?
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.200]   So that courage to act.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.600]   So I'll give you an example.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:56.640]   Recently, I was convicted by God, by the Holy Spirit,
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.440]   and it's been going on for some time,
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.320]   but I recently acted on it,
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.060]   of a bridge that I needed to build.
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.620]   A bridge that had been severed.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:14.620]   A group that I needed to reach out and build a bridge.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:19.780]   And by the grace of God, through the humility
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.620]   that is a grace, then I could recognize
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.660]   that I need to do something, and I am part of it.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.900]   Now, you have to have the courage, right?
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.820]   Because you can know that, but you've gotta get on the MTR
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:35.180]   and go to that person, or to that whatever, right?
[00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.500]   You've gotta do it.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.500]   And so recently I did.
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.140]   Felt it, got on the MTR, went to the place
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.540]   where we were going to meet,
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:50.740]   walked around several times before I went into the place,
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.960]   get a little bit of courage, and went in.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:59.900]   What about you?
[00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:06.500]   In your humility, and by the grace of God,
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.520]   when you thought of those two groups,
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.260]   what's your part in it?
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:12.300]   You might really not be a part at all.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.740]   That might be one of the giftings, is to come together,
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.580]   but it might be that you have a part.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:20.060]   But what's the part of humility that you then act on,
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.900]   encourage, and to step out?
[00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:26.340]   That becomes, then, the heart.
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.900]   Now we're way below the surface, right?
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.460]   And now we're really looking at individually who we are.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:38.460]   And when we do that, I wanna say something very clearly.
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:43.460]   Don't go into the bridge-building business.
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.100]   Don't go into the bridge-building work
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:51.240]   without building that foundation on Jesus Christ.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.900]   And this is how Paul finishes this part of the text.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.420]   "For no one can lay any foundation
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:02.340]   "other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ."
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.380]   Jesus knows about those groups
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.380]   that you were picturing in your mind,
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.400]   and his heart most likely is broken, as maybe yours is.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.220]   But he's also laying a foundation.
[00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:18.980]   Did you know that bridges have foundations?
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.820]   Yeah, you're kinda nodding like,
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.460]   "That's very obvious, Steve, yes." (laughs)
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.900]   It wasn't obvious for me so much,
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.500]   'cause Paul here is talking about foundations
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.060]   in terms of a building, right?
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:35.100]   And we all think of that, but bridges have foundations too.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.540]   In fact, when the architect and the engineer work together,
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.780]   then there's at least seven different types of foundations
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:43.300]   they could put into that bridge,
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.020]   depending on the terrain of what they need to do,
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.320]   and there's probably more.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:52.100]   Priestly perspective, not an engineering perspective
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:53.220]   or an architecture perspective,
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.300]   but from a priestly perspective,
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.340]   there's only one foundation that we build on,
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.380]   and that is Jesus Christ.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.340]   There is only one bridge builder that we follow,
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.640]   the one who came down and, as I said before,
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.900]   made that vertical bridge that any one of us tonight,
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:17.220]   if there is a broken bridge between you and God,
[00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.060]   or if there never really has been a direct connection,
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.320]   then Jesus says, "I'm here."
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.220]   And he also yearns for your neighbor,
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.260]   because Jesus didn't say, "Love the Lord your God
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:37.180]   "with all your heart, soul, mind, and body, full stop."
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:38.220]   He said, "Love the Lord your God
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.600]   "with your heart, soul, mind, and body,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.580]   "and love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.180]   This is the great commandment, singular.
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:50.180]   So the bridges, again, go vertically and horizontally,
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:52.420]   and that's the cross.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.020]   And so look for the cross in 1 Corinthians.
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.680]   You'll find the cross coming up,
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.440]   Paul mentioning it again and again.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.460]   That's the bridge building.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.020]   That's what brings us all together.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.340]   For no one can lay any foundation
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.980]   other than that of Jesus Christ, amen?
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:20.020]   Are we still on?
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.940]   Yeah, okay, so we're gonna close here.
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.260]   I thought maybe the sound booth was telling me,
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.860]   "Okay, it's time, we're cutting you."
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:25.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.900]   You're done, so.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:32.900]   We wanna close with a song, and we want,
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.100]   I'm not gonna sing, but we wanna close with a song,
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.100]   and we wanna close with a prayer.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.380]   But before we do that, I think,
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:41.540]   do we have a few minutes, Michelle?
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.660]   Okay, any thoughts, questions?
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:48.900]   Is that ringing true?
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.900]   Is that resonating, maybe, with where we are?
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:55.580]   You're being very polite, that's good.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.100]   Okay, good, no, no, no,
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:58.380]   but is there any questions in that?
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:29:59.900]   Any things when you're thinking about that,
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.900]   you think, "How does that actually work?"
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:06.500]   You ready to do some bridge building?
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.020]   Feel a little bit scared?
[00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:15.140]   It's okay, you know, courage,
[00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:18.620]   the definition of courage is overcoming fear.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:21.140]   If you don't have fear, you don't have courage.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.140]   If you're in a perfect world, you don't need courage.
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:26.660]   You only need courage when there's something to overcome.
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:30.180]   So it's okay to feel that fear, but we have that courage.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.180]   Okay, so let's do this.
[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.980]   Rather than talk to me, let's talk to God.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:37.820]   That'll probably be much more useful.
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.700]   So we're gonna do this.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.900]   We're gonna have a song that we're gonna close in,
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:47.380]   but before we go into the song, I wanna give us a prayer.
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.740]   It's a very simple prayer.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.340]   And it's a prayer, whoops.
[00:30:52.340 --> 00:31:02.060]   It's a prayer about humility.
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.540]   It's about a servant's heart.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:10.540]   And it's a prayer a mentor taught me many years ago.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.220]   And it's a very simple prayer.
[00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.540]   You can say it in less than a second.
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.500]   And so I wanna offer that prayer to you
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.020]   because I feel like that in this prayer,
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.780]   it's something for some of us.
[00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.940]   May not be for all of us,
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:25.900]   but there's something for some of us.
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:29.340]   But the song I also want us to be thinking about.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.100]   So as the band is playing,
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:36.060]   then the song we're gonna sing is Christ is enough, right?
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.220]   Is he?
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.860]   You know?
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.180]   Yes, he is.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.540]   But we need to confirm that and affirm that.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.300]   So when we're hearing that song,
[00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:48.860]   it is Christ is enough.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.140]   His foundation is enough for the bridge
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.060]   you're going to build or are building.
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:56.380]   Many of you are already way ahead of me
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.140]   in building those bridges.
[00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:58.980]   But there's something else.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.220]   You know, right in the middle, there's that beautiful part,
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.660]   I have decided to follow Jesus.
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:09.660]   Okay, that's Paul's answer to, I'm not following Apollos.
[00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:11.940]   I'm not following Cephas.
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.140]   I'm not following Paul even.
[00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.220]   We're following Jesus Christ.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:19.300]   Okay, so here's the prayer.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.700]   The prayer is this.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.100]   Lord, bring me someone to serve today.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.020]   Yeah, it's pretty simple, right?
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:32.260]   I have a little bit of fear and trembling
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:34.820]   every time I'm going to pray this prayer.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.380]   There are people who won't pray this prayer.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.700]   They don't believe that God answers prayer,
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:38.780]   but they're not gonna pray this prayer
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:40.780]   because they know he'll answer this, right?
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.620]   And he does.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:48.660]   And sometimes in beautiful ways, simple ways.
[00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:52.020]   If you're like me, you know, my day is kind of full, right?
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.140]   And so then you're thinking, if I pray that,
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.020]   what's gonna happen?
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.820]   And am I gonna, you know, and we imagine worst case scenarios
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.460]   and we're cleaning, you know.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.260]   But our God is a gracious God.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.420]   His grace is sufficient for you.
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.380]   So one of the first times I got back
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.140]   to praying this recently, I was just walking down
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.620]   by the Hotel Gen in that area.
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:17.340]   And there was a domestic worker
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.700]   who was looking for a Hotel Gen
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.300]   because they wanted to take something
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.660]   who was for a person there in quarantine.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.900]   And this person was going up to everybody
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.140]   and everybody was saying, I don't know where it is.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:31.380]   But I did know because we had,
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.140]   when our daughter had stayed in Hotel Gen
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:34.700]   and it was right there.
[00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.500]   And so she came over and I said, yeah, that's where it is.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.540]   And she was very gracious and she went on.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.100]   I feel like that was my service that day
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.900]   'cause I just prayed the prayer about 10 minutes before.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.420]   It might be as simple as that.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.820]   There are other times when I prayed that prayer
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.420]   which begins a much deeper journey.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.340]   But let's do this.
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.060]   Let's pray the prayer and pray it together.
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.420]   So let's do that right now.
[00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:04.060]   So yeah, you may wanna just bow your head
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.300]   or close your eyes, give your neighbor a little bit of space.
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.660]   We'll pray a little bit.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.580]   And I'd like to pray for you and over you.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:14.940]   And as we're sitting here in silence,
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.260]   I thank you that you are here.
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.500]   None of us is here without a purpose.
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.540]   That God had a plan for us being here
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.420]   and he had a word for us.
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.180]   And we don't wanna miss that.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.900]   So in our silence, we wanna say,
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.580]   God, if there's anything that you wanted me to hear,
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.420]   let me hear that.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:38.100]   Or maybe you already know what it was
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.460]   and just go there in your conversation.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.620]   And I pray that if there's anyone here
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.300]   who feels severed from God,
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.460]   who feels like the bridge has fallen down,
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.860]   who feels like they never really had a bridge,
[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.340]   who feels somehow they're just distant from God.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:00.780]   Michelle preached beautifully last week about directional.
[00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.980]   It's not how far or how close you are to God,
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.020]   it's which direction you're going.
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.580]   And you can turn and just start going back
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.820]   and you can pray to the bridge builder,
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:17.540]   Jesus Christ, connect me to God.
[00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.980]   And there are many here
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:29.660]   that did have a pretty clear image
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.620]   of the groups that they would love to bring together.
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.620]   And so pray for that, pray for them.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.660]   Pray that you can be part of the bridge building exercise.
[00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:49.380]   And then through the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.980]   let the Holy Spirit pray this prayer through you.
[00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:57.980]   Lord, bring me someone to serve today, even today.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:02.420]   And then pray it tomorrow.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.820]   And then pray it tomorrow and the next day.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.820]   It's a bridge builder's prayer.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:13.580]   Lord, hear our prayer.
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:23.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
