[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   Hello KFCI, it's good to be able to gather again to hear the word and to worship through
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.520]   song.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.880]   We surely have missed all of you.
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.560]   We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:24.320]   And let's start now for today's service with some worship through song.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:49.160]   I cast my mind to Calvary where Jesus bled and died for me.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:56.760]   I see His wounds, His hands, His feet.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.520]   My Savior on that cursed tree.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:22.400]   His body bound and drenched in tears.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:40.800]   The entrance sealed by heavy stone, Messiah saved and all alone.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:52.680]   Oh praise the name of the Lord our God.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.280]   Oh praise His name forevermore.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.600]   For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:14.200]   Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:27.840]   And on the third at break of dawn, the Son of Heaven rose again.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.760]   Oh trampled death, where is your sting?
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:45.760]   The angels roar for Christ the King.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.760]   Oh praise the name of the Lord our God.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.760]   Oh praise His name forevermore.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.760]   For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.760]   He shall return in robes of white.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.760]   The blazing sun shall peace unite.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:37.760]   And I will rise among the saints.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:55.760]   My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:05.760]   Because we are all friendly on that day.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.760]   For endless days.
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.760]   Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.760]   Oh praise the name of the Lord our God.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.760]   Oh praise His name forevermore.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.760]   For endless days we will sing Your praise.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.760]   Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.760]   Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   [MUSIC - "MAD OF SORROWS"]
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.760]   "Mad of Sorrows."
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:39.240]   Mad of sorrows, Lamb of God, by His own betrayal.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:50.720]   The sin of man and wrath of God has been on Jesus' name.
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:09.200]   Silent as He stood accused, beaten, moult, and scorned.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:21.680]   Bowing to the Father's will, He took a crown of thorns.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:28.680]   Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:35.680]   where Your love poured out over me.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.160]   Now my soul cries out, hallelujah.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.640]   Praise and honor unto Thee.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   [MUSIC - "SENT OF HEAVEN"]
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   "Sent of Heaven."
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:06.080]   Sent of heaven, God's own Son to purge, his hand redeem.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:19.560]   And reckonsile the very ones who nailed him to that tree.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:26.040]   Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.520]   where Your love poured out over me.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:39.000]   Now my soul cries out, hallelujah.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Praise and honor unto Thee.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   "Now My Debt."
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.480]   Now my debt is paid.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   It is paid in full by the precious blood
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.960]   that my Jesus bled.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.440]   Now the curse of sin has no hold on me.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:15.920]   Whom the Son sets free, oh, is free indeed.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.400]   Now my debt is paid.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.880]   It is paid in full by the precious blood
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.360]   that my Jesus bled.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:35.840]   Now the curse of sin has no hold on me.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   Whom the Son sets free, oh, is free indeed.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:49.320]   Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.800]   where Your love poured out over me.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:02.280]   Now my soul cries out, hallelujah.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.760]   Praise and honor unto Thee.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.720]   "See the Stone."
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.120]   See the stone is rolled away.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.600]   Behold the empty tomb.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.080]   And hallelujah, God be praised.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.560]   He's risen from the grave.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:45.040]   Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:51.520]   where Your love poured out over me.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:58.000]   Now my soul cries out, hallelujah.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.480]   Praise and honor unto Thee.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:10.960]   Praise and honor unto Thee.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.960]   Praise and honor unto Thee.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:23.120]   Thank you, worship team.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.440]   Now we're going to enter into a time of prayer.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.880]   I'm going to pray first.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:29.360]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.040]   that even though we're in the middle of this crisis,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.320]   that you are still sovereign, that you
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.160]   are Lord over all things, and we trust in you.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.960]   Lord, we want to specifically pray for our world leaders.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.880]   Lord, every decision that they make is very important.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.520]   And we ask that, Lord, you would give them wisdom to know how
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.040]   to make every decision.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.520]   I pray that, Lord, they would surrender to you
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.720]   and ask the Lord of all knowledge and wisdom
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.480]   to help them.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.280]   I pray that, Lord, you would comfort these leaders
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.160]   as they must be under tremendous stress.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:08.040]   Lord, guide them by your spirit, we pray in Christ's name.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.640]   Amen.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.160]   Lord, I just pray for medical leaders all around the world,
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.660]   Lord.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:13.920]   I pray for--
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.680]   yeah, Lord, just that you would continue to keep these frontline
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.600]   workers safe.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   Thank you for them, Lord.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.120]   Just thank you for the courage that they have in--
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.040]   yeah, Lord, just reaching out to the sick,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.360]   in making sure everyone stays healthy and safe, Lord,
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.320]   and in just tending for those who have
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.880]   been afflicted of the sickness.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.720]   Lord, we just pray that you would continue
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.160]   to protect them, Lord, that those
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.480]   who are in dire need of resources
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.560]   would be able to get protection supplies from where
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.520]   they need, Lord.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.100]   And we pray, too, that you would give them adequate rest,
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.100]   that you would keep their bodies healthy,
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.440]   especially because they're fighting on the front lines,
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.200]   Lord, and it's even more important for them to be safe.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.520]   So Lord, we just pray for your protection over them.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.720]   In Jesus's name I pray, amen.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.560]   And now we pass the time to Pastor John.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:11.760]   One of the people that we're praying for at the moment
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.560]   is the Prime Minister of Britain.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.640]   I'm reminded of a comment made by a former Prime Minister,
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:24.600]   Harold Wilson, who said, "A week is a long time in politics."
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.240]   I think we could safely say that a week in 2020
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.880]   is also a long time.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.840]   In some countries around the world, just this last week,
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   the number of cases, the death toll,
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.400]   has actually doubled inside that week.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.680]   Even this week in Hong Kong, I mean,
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.480]   restrictions have been placed.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.280]   For example, Johnny can't go to the pub anymore.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.720]   James can't play mahjong anymore.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.440]   Bonnie can't go karaoke.
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.160]   And you know, I could go downstairs and order
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:05.040]   a Big Mac and large fries at 5 to 6 in the evening,
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.960]   but not get one at 5 past 6.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:15.200]   We are studying Matthew's Gospel and have entitled our series,
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.960]   Jesus is King.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.680]   25%, one quarter of Matthew's Gospel
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.440]   is devoted to the last week of Jesus' life.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:34.400]   That's the last 0.05% of Jesus' life.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.680]   We see, don't we, on one hand, the crowd shouting, "Hosanna!
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.880]   Jesus is King!
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:46.400]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:52.640]   Days later, the crowd shouting, "Crucify!
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.840]   Crucify him!"
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.840]   In a few days, the mood has changed,
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.920]   gone from celebration to apparent defeat.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:13.840]   The so-called Savior, Messiah, the King, dead on the cross.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.600]   The sign above his head mocking him,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.080]   Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.120]   It seems that even those who crucified him
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:30.560]   have been listening to our sermon series.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:35.240]   I guess that's a little how our city feels
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:39.920]   after the social unrest followed quickly by the virus.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.480]   But we know it is not the end.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:53.360]   I love the book by Tony Campolo, "It's Friday,
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.960]   but Sunday's coming."
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:01.120]   We meet today not as a people defeated,
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.320]   but as one poised for victory.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.840]   Johnny will be back next week to talk to us
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.480]   about the resurrection.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.120]   We are looking forward to Easter Sunday,
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.480]   and weeks after that to Pentecost,
[00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:19.840]   to the coming of the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.920]   And we have a choice.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.120]   We can stay here, and I'm not undermining
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.560]   our serious situation.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.720]   Or we can prepare for resurrection,
[00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:36.920]   and we can prepare for a fresh wave of the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.760]   It's a dilemma having a Saturday service.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.760]   I always wonder at Easter whether we're actually
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:53.160]   having a Good Friday service or an Easter Sunday service,
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.920]   or maybe a bit of both.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.040]   We call this week before Easter Holy Week,
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.800]   because it was originally the time of the Feast of Passover
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.960]   when the Jews were saved in Egypt.
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:12.040]   And because of the miraculous things
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.760]   that Jesus did in the last week of his life.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.800]   During Holy Week, we wave palms in the air
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.360]   and hail Jesus as King, the long-awaited Messiah
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.640]   who's going to save us.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:33.080]   Then we change our minds and scream that the Romans should
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.600]   crucify him.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.480]   We share a loving Last Supper.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.880]   And he washes our feet.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.960]   Then we sneak out after dinner, and we betray him.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:51.040]   Jesus begs us to stay with him.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.840]   We promise we will.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.720]   Then we don't.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.000]   We abandon him.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.280]   He's arrested and beaten.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.920]   He forgives us, and then we run away.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.120]   Then Jesus is killed.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.800]   We lay him in a tomb and weep.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.400]   We go back for him.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.600]   Then he's gone.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.080]   Now he's back.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.120]   Then wait.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.120]   He's not dead at all.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:29.480]   We witness to Christ in song and story throughout Holy Week.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:38.440]   On Palm Sunday, normal times process with palms and songs.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:43.320]   We celebrate Jesus triumphantly riding into Jerusalem
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.480]   on the back of a donkey.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:52.160]   Men and women line the streets yelling, "Hosanna!"
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.600]   and waving palm branches.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.280]   They were greeting the Messiah who they
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.320]   believe had come to save us.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.760]   Let's hear James read that account to us.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:13.400]   The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.120]   They brought the donkey and the colt
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.400]   and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.200]   A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.160]   while others cut branches from the trees
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.920]   and spread them on the road.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.480]   The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.040]   shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.080]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.360]   Hosanna in the highest!"
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.560]   When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.440]   was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:45.120]   The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.680]   from Nazareth in Galilee."
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:54.280]   We can be like that crowd.
[00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:58.720]   Fair-weather Christians in church at weekend,
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:04.120]   singing praise songs, hands lifted high in worship.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.360]   I love the song by Matt Redmond, "Blessed Be Your Name."
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:14.000]   He actually wrote this after 9/11 in 2001.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.040]   And he says, "Look, when the sun is shining down on me
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.640]   and the world, all it should be, blessed be your name."
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.680]   But then he said, "When there's pain in the offering,
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.240]   on the road, Mark, we're suffering.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:35.000]   Blessed be your name."
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.640]   On Holy Monday, we remember Jesus
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.880]   throwing out all the money changers and vendors
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.760]   from the temple.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.280]   Now, the temple in Jerusalem was a place of worship.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.960]   It was the center of worship for the Jews.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.200]   And they were required to present money and animals
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:20:00.120]   for sacrifice to the priests when they visited.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.360]   Johnny is going to read this now to us.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.200]   "Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.440]   all who were buying and selling there.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.200]   He overturned the tables of the money changers
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.920]   and the benches of those selling doves.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.320]   It is written, he said to them, 'My house
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.400]   will be called a house of prayer,
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:22.960]   but you are making it a den of robbers.'"
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.280]   Animal vendors and money changers
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.400]   had set up booths in the courts.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.200]   People believed that God actually
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.120]   lived in the most holy of holy places,
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.600]   the inner sanctum of the temple.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.720]   The desecration angered Jesus so much
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.080]   that he turned over the tables of the money changers
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:49.560]   and ran all the animal vendors out.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:54.200]   Now, before we start asking, how dare they?
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:21:00.440]   We have to ask ourselves, are the same hands
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:05.320]   that are lifted in worship at the weekend involved
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.240]   in something in the office on Monday
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.680]   that we should be ashamed of?
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:18.640]   Something underhand stabbing a colleague in the back,
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:23.880]   gossiping this Easter weekend?
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.960]   Let's search ourselves.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.920]   And if we find that we are a little too much
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:37.720]   like the money changers, get on our knees before the King
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.280]   and ask him to forgive.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.120]   On Holy Tuesday, Jesus spent most of the day
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.720]   at the Mount of Olives.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.120]   On the Mount of Olives, where he preached.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   Our team was there in June last year.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.200]   There's a picture on the screen.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.920]   And we get the parables of the kingdom.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.920]   James spoke to us last week about the parables of Jesus.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.320]   He was telling the crowds what the kingdom would be like
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.080]   and how we could join him.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.480]   The parables of the two sons, the tenants, the wedding
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.480]   banquet, the 10 virgins, the talents, the sheep
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.360]   and the goats are quoted in these chapters.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:31.360]   I wonder if we have fully embraced Jesus as King
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:36.480]   and understand what kingdom living actually is.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:43.600]   On what is strangely called Spy Wednesday,
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.920]   we remember Judas Iscariot, a zealot,
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.160]   who thought he was doing the right thing by agreeing
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.360]   to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.400]   He thought that if Jesus was jailed,
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:05.280]   the people would rise up and overthrow the Romans.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.840]   Let's hear this from Paul.
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.040]   Then one of the 12, the one called Judas Iscariot,
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:12.880]   went to the chief priest and asked,
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.040]   "What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?"
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   So they counted out for him 30 pieces of silver.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:25.280]   From then on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.680]   On what is called Maundy Thursday,
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:34.600]   Jesus shared a common meal with his disciples.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.480]   We call this the Eucharist or the Holy Communion.
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:43.240]   Many churches around the world strip their altars
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.920]   and cover any icons or statues on Maundy Thursday
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:52.240]   in preparation for the morning of Jesus' crucifixion
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.960]   on Good Friday.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.160]   There will be no celebration of communion
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.640]   until the resurrection.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.400]   Many other churches hold feet washings,
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.160]   washing each other's feet to commemorate
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:13.880]   that Jesus washed the feet of his disciples.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.080]   I'm sharing with you now a precious photo.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.320]   This was actually my last day
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.960]   as senior pastor of the Vine Church.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.520]   And you'll see in this picture that Sandra and I
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.840]   were having our feet washed by Andrew and Chris Gardner,
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.120]   who were just about to take over as senior pastors.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.160]   This was one of the most memorable times of my whole life.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:43.200]   But Jesus reminds us that we're to love each other
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.880]   as he loved us.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.120]   We are to metaphorically wash each other's feet.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:53.280]   He equips his army, not with a sword,
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.520]   but with a bowl and a towel.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:06.760]   Who is he calling you to minister to this Easter weekend?
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.160]   Let's read the story of the Last Supper for Florence.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.840]   While they were eating, Jesus took bread,
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.120]   and when he had given thanks, he broke it
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:18.280]   and gave it to his disciples, saying,
[00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   "Take and eat, this is my body."
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.360]   Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks,
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:28.240]   he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.400]   This is my blood of the covenant,
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.040]   which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.400]   I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.920]   from now on until the day when I drink it new with you
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.960]   in my father's kingdom."
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.120]   When they had sung a hymn, they went out
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:48.560]   to the Mount of Olives.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.960]   After the meal, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.640]   to pray.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.840]   He asked the disciples to stay and pray with him,
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.320]   but they all fall asleep.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.840]   Jesus is left to pray for strength
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:11.880]   for what is to come by himself, abandoned by his own disciples.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:20.920]   Judas then identified Jesus to the Roman guards with a kiss,
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.520]   and he was taken away by the soldiers.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.960]   Now, we are not entirely sure why this Friday got
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.040]   the name of Good Friday.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.840]   It certainly wasn't a good day.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.240]   Jesus was brought here before Pilate, the Roman governor,
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.800]   and sentenced to death.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.880]   He was then forced to walk the hill of Golgotha,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.240]   carrying the cross to which he would be crucified.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.240]   There was a commemoration of this walk
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.720]   called the Stations of the Cross, which participants
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.040]   remember each of the steps of the crucifixion.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:06.920]   Our team did that on the Via Della Rosa.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.560]   Bonnie is going to read this account to us.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.960]   "From noon until three in the afternoon,
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.920]   darkness came over all the land.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.000]   About three in the afternoon, Jesus
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.820]   cried out in a loud voice, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:28.240]   which means, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.640]   When some of those standing there heard this, they said,
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.280]   he's calling Elijah.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:37.760]   Immediately, one of them ran and got a sponge.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.080]   He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff,
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.160]   and offered it to Jesus to drink.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.960]   The rest said, now leave him alone.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.720]   Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.320]   And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice,
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.000]   he gave up his spirit.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.400]   At that moment, the curtain of the temple
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.680]   was torn in two from top to bottom."
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:06.400]   It doesn't sound very good.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.000]   Good Friday is good because Christ
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.960]   showed his great love for man and purchased for him
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.000]   every blessing.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:29.480]   If you've accepted his love, it is good news indeed.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:39.320]   If you've rejected his love, it's bad news,
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.040]   worse than any virus.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:48.160]   Jesus' body was taken down from the cross
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:51.720]   and buried in an unused tomb.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:56.320]   Holy Saturday ends the season of Lent,
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:03.520]   for Easter Sunday will be a celebration of new life.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:09.680]   Holy Saturday is a day of waiting for the resurrection
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.120]   on Easter Sunday.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.760]   Let's hear it.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.120]   "The next day, the one after preparation day,
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.800]   the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.600]   'Sir,' they said.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.960]   We remember that while he was still alive,
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.800]   that deceiver said, 'After three days, I will rise again.'
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.520]   So give the order for the tomb to be made secure
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.280]   until the third day.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.520]   Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.400]   and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.160]   This last deception will be worse than the first.'
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.600]   'Take a guard,' Pilate answered.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:50.240]   'Go make the tombs as secure as you know how.'
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.280]   So they went and made the tomb secure
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:57.480]   by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard."
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:03.120]   "And so we leave it, the king dead,
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:10.520]   in a tomb with guards and a heavy stone."
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.320]   I'm going to give you a spoiler alert now.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.480]   Jesus did not stay dead.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:24.080]   He did not stay in the tomb.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   He is risen.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.920]   And next week, Pastor Johnny is going to talk
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.000]   all about the resurrection.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.680]   But what about us?
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.040]   We can pause and reflect.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.920]   Think about each of the days of Holy Week
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.960]   and what preparation you can make
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.640]   to be ready for the festive celebration
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:56.600]   and the resurrection of Jesus on Easter Sunday.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.360]   I'm going to invite our worship team back now.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.680]   We're going to sing this wonderful old hymn,
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.920]   "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross."
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.360]   I want you, perhaps not so much to sing it,
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.080]   but to reflect on the words.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:20.080]   And let this be your Holy Week meditation.
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:36.760]   When I survey the wondrous cross
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:49.560]   On which the Prince of glory died
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:56.080]   My riches gained
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:02.560]   I count but loss
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:09.080]   And poor contempt
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:15.760]   On all my pride
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:22.280]   Forbeating Lord
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:28.720]   That I should go
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:35.280]   Saving the dead
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:41.680]   Of Christ my God
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:48.120]   O the vain things
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:54.440]   That shunned me most
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:33:00.840]   I sacrifice
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:07.120]   Them to His blood
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:13.640]   To from His hand
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:19.800]   His hands His feet
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:26.240]   Sorrow and love
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:32.520]   Throw me, Lord, down
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:38.800]   Did it such love
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:45.040]   And sorrow mean
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:51.120]   O thorns can bow
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:57.640]   So rich a crown
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:04.120]   Were the whole realm
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:10.560]   Of nature mine
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:17.720]   That were a present
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:23.520]   Far too small
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:31.040]   Love so amazing
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:36.800]   So divine
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:43.400]   Demands my soul
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:48.600]   My life, my all
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.240]   Demands
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:57.040]   Demands my soul
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   My life, my all
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:08.040]   That last verse says,
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.640]   "Were the whole realm of nature mine
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:15.240]   That were a present, that were an offering
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.440]   Far too small
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.040]   Love so amazing
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.640]   So divine
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.040]   Demands my soul
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:31.640]   My life, my all
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.240]   And our response to Jesus
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.640]   Who went to the cross
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.440]   Who stayed three days dead in the tomb
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:49.840]   Is to say, "Jesus, I offer you my life
[00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.640]   I want to pray a prayer now."
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:56.640]   And wherever you're watching from,
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.440]   you can join in this.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:07.640]   You can ask this Jesus to be your Lord and your Savior.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.840]   Yes, He's King.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.440]   He's King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.040]   He's ruler of the universe.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:22.040]   But today, He can be King of your heart.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   Would you just bow your heads and pray with me?
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:32.440]   Father God, I thank you for Holy Week.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:39.040]   Thank you for the mixed emotions from the crowd shouting "Hosanna"
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:46.440]   to the crowds asking for the death of your Son.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:54.440]   We thank you Jesus that you went to the cross willingly for me.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.840]   Lord, I recognize I've sinned.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.440]   It was my sins that put you there on that cross.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.440]   I ask you now to forgive me
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:10.440]   and come into my life by your Holy Spirit.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:16.440]   In Jesus' name, Amen.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:21.040]   So two things, Church.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.440]   There's a worksheet that goes along with this sermon.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.240]   There's some questions I've posed there.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:31.840]   One of you just take it away and just spend this Easter weekend
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.840]   reflecting on Holy Week and what we've learned today.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:40.040]   And if you prayed that prayer to ask Jesus in your life,
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.640]   drop us an email, get us on Facebook, anywhere, and just tell us.
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:49.840]   We'd love to get in touch with you and to encourage you on this journey.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.640]   And we look forward to seeing you back here next weekend
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.040]   as we celebrate the resurrection of our Lord.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   [silence]
