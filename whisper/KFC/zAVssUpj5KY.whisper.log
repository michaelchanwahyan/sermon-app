[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Thank you so much, James. - Mary.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   - And I hope everyone can hear me.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.200]   It's a real honor and a privilege to speak to you tonight.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.560]   I think when people heard that Pastor John
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.380]   was gonna speak about Samson,
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.360]   I think a lot of people had the idea
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.220]   that I was gonna preach about this guy.
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.160]   That's my dog, my baby boy called Samson.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.080]   And actually, although I'm not preaching about Samson,
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.440]   my dog, there is a very strong connection
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.920]   between the word tonight and my dog.
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.880]   You see, about three and a half years ago,
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.640]   our previous dog, Oscar, passed away.
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.200]   And our two eldest grandchildren in particular
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.500]   were very, very sad.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.280]   And what we said to them was this,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.080]   is that we'll get a new dog, not straight away,
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.000]   but when we do, we'll allow you to come with us
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.160]   and pick the dog out.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.000]   And sure enough, about three months later,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.520]   it was a Thursday before Easter,
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.280]   we went down to LAP,
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.760]   Lifelong Animal Protection in Tsuen Wan,
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.960]   and there were tons of dogs there, but also cats as well.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.120]   And I have to say, my eldest grandson, Ollie,
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.640]   decided he'd rather spend the whole afternoon in the cats.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.440]   He was on the floor with the cats.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.360]   But it soon became obvious to us,
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.120]   the dog that we had to choose,
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.400]   because he jumped on the sofa, he jumped on our laps,
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.880]   and we said, "This is the one.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.280]   "This is the one that we're gonna have."
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.200]   And we said, "What's his name?"
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.160]   And he said, "Well, he came from a Chinese family,
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.360]   "a local family, so he has a Chinese name,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.240]   "but we've decided to call him Kenneth."
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.640]   And I thought, "I'm not gonna call any dog of mine Kenneth."
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.600]   So actually, what we did, okay, so they said,
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.920]   "You can't take him today because he hasn't been neutered.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.920]   "He's still a boy, and he has to go away for operation.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.480]   "You can pick him up on Sunday."
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.200]   So actually, we went down there on Sunday,
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.880]   and actually, he wasn't there.
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.760]   And we wondered what had happened.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.160]   He hadn't come back from the vets
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.760]   where he'd been having the operation.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.200]   So we went back on Monday, and it was a rather bizarre tale.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.080]   Actually, they told us that during the operation,
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.560]   he had an allergy, allergic reaction to the anesthetic,
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.960]   and had died.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.400]   He died on the operating theater,
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.640]   but the vet was able to resuscitate him
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   and bring him back to life.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.120]   And by the time we picked him up on the Monday,
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.440]   he had really red eyes from the effect
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.280]   of this anesthetic and everything.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.440]   So we wondered what to call him.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.340]   And our two grandchildren said,
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.080]   "Why don't you call him Jesus?
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.600]   "I mean, he died at Easter and was raised again."
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.880]   Now, that seems a very good thing,
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.200]   but can you imagine going down the park
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.120]   and calling out for your dog, "Jesus, Jesus!"
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.320]   You know, people would really look at you.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.320]   So we had a competition on social media to pick a name.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.640]   And it became obvious after a while
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.980]   that actually the winner was going to be Samson.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.880]   And then it occurred to me
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.200]   that Samson was a type of Jesus.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.560]   Samson had broken chains just in the way
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.560]   that Jesus in the New Testament breaks chains for us.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.120]   So we were very pleased to give him the name Samson.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.380]   Now I need to move on.
[00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.400]   Pastor Johnny did a great job
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.980]   taking us to halftime in our story of Samson.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.600]   And we take our halftime break, as it were,
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.520]   celebrating what Johnny described wonderfully
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.880]   as the victory at Jawbone Hill.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.960]   You'll see a picture.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.960]   We have a sporting expression, a game of two halves.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.420]   And this is what we're going to see.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.720]   And can I tell you, Samson doesn't come out of it very well.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.840]   So much so, we describe him as the man
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.200]   who could resist everything but temptation.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.400]   But I want to say up front
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.560]   that this is a story of breaking chains.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.600]   And my prayer for you this afternoon,
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.620]   wherever you are in your Christian world,
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.680]   that actually as a result of hearing this word,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.520]   as a result of praying,
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.420]   that chains will be broken in every one of our lives.
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.480]   We've heard the story week after week.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.820]   The Israelites were in this cycle of sin.
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.920]   Instead of driving out the Canaanites like God asked them to,
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   they would allow the Canaanites to influence them.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.280]   And they ended up joining in their practices,
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.760]   which led to idolatry.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.880]   When they got to the point where they were being oppressed,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.640]   they cried out to God for a savior.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.560]   And so God raised judges to deliver them once again.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.540]   But not long after that deliverer died,
[00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.360]   they got involved with the Canaanites
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.080]   and the Philistines again,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.840]   and the sin cycle started all over again.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.920]   Now we find even today,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.920]   many Christians find ourselves still in bondage
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:29.160]   to the very things that we should have gotten rid of
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.320]   at the very beginning of our Christian journey.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.340]   And today we're gonna look at a man
[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.560]   who had the same problem,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.180]   a man named Samson.
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.540]   And we're gonna see that Samson is a man
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:53.540]   who became very much enslaved by his own cravings.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.440]   You see, Johnny told us last time, he strangled a lion.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.660]   But as we will see today, he couldn't strangle his lust.
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:11.820]   We saw last time he burst his ropes,
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.800]   but we will see today he was bound by his appetite.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.800]   Again, he burned the enemy's crops,
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.700]   and yet he was inflamed with his desire for their women.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.600]   Yes, he was strong, but he wasn't really in control.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.080]   And yes, he could conquer his enemies,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:48.140]   but sadly he couldn't conquer himself.
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.260]   Now, one of the things I love about the Bible
[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.040]   is its honesty and its openness
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.760]   when it comes to Bible heroes.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.200]   The Bible tells us about people's failings
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.960]   as well as their high points.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.640]   And in Judges chapter 16, the very first verse
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.000]   is one of those verses concerning Samson.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   It says this, "One day Samson went to Gaza
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.600]   "where he saw a prostitute.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:30.040]   "He went in to spend the night with her."
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:36.220]   Now notice, the author of Judges tells it as it is.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:42.020]   He doesn't try to cover up Samson's scandalous behavior.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.020]   Whoa.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:49.720]   Now think about what Samson is doing.
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.680]   He is supposed to be God's deliverer.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.500]   He is supposed to be a savior of Israel.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.120]   But as we are going to see,
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.120]   Samson sowing his seeds here now in Gaza
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.320]   is gonna have consequences.
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.920]   And his sin is going to be reaped later
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.680]   in his own very destruction with Delilah.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.820]   In other words, my friends, sin has consequences.
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:35.020]   Let me say that again.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.680]   Sin has consequences.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:45.280]   Samson did what we nearly all do
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.000]   when we're deceived by sin.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.840]   He put his life into categories
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.080]   and figured there were some categories
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.340]   that God cared about
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.700]   and some categories that God did not care about.
[00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.880]   Let's read on.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.200]   Verses two and three.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.200]   "The people at Gaza were told, 'Samson is here.'
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:17.320]   "So they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.700]   "all night at the city gate.
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:26.020]   "They made no move during the night,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.460]   "saying, 'At dawn we'll kill him.'
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:35.380]   "But Samson lay there only until the middle of the night.
[00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:42.240]   "Then he got up and he took hold of the doors
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.180]   "of the city gate together with the two posts
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.280]   "and he tore them loose bar and all.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.580]   "He lifted them on his shoulders
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.580]   "and carried them to the top of the hill that faces Hebron."
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:07.280]   So the people of Gaza know that Samson is here.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.940]   He's not trying to keep a low profile.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.000]   The Philistines thought to themselves,
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.440]   "I know, we'll secure the city gates
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.960]   "and we'll lock him in."
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.720]   Now, what does Samson do?
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:32.280]   He lifts the gate with his enormous might
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.920]   and carries them to Hebron.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.880]   That's 40 miles away.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.080]   What?
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.940]   Let's pause and think about this for a moment.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.160]   It is estimated that these gates
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.840]   may have weighed over 400 kilograms
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:58.240]   and he carried them 65 kilometers.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:05.320]   We may wonder how Samson performed his amazing feats,
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.480]   but we have to remember
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.160]   that there are no limits to God's power.
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.200]   Can I say that again?
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:23.280]   There are no limits to God's power.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.720]   Yes, Samson was an embarrassment
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.920]   and yes, he was out of control
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.380]   and yes, he was sinful,
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:40.480]   but God still used him to achieve his goal.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.240]   And what was God's goal?
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.560]   To deliver God's people once again from their enemies.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:13:00.800]   And remember, God doesn't create evil men,
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:08.320]   but he does use evil men to accomplish his plans.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   But you can see how the tension had intensified
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.240]   between Samson and the Philistines.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.960]   He didn't help things by sleeping with their prostitutes,
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.020]   ripping up and carrying off their city gates
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.920]   and killing a thousand of them at a time
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.320]   using any old donkey jawbone lying around.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:37.920]   But the Philistines found a way for revenge.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.300]   When Samson, you see the picture beautifully here,
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:47.300]   Samson fell in love with a woman called Delilah.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:53.640]   Look at these verses.
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:14:00.440]   The Philistines promised her a large sum
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.480]   if she could find out the source of Samson's strength.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.480]   I want to put this into context in modern money.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:17.440]   The sum of money that she was promised in today's terms
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.600]   was around 4 million Hong Kong dollars.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.800]   That's a lot of money.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:29.240]   And Samson continues to move from one woman to another,
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.920]   but this is no ordinary woman.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.120]   This is Delilah.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.920]   Samson fell in love with this Philistine woman
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.480]   and because of his openly soft spot for women,
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.160]   the enemy soon discovered his weakness.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:57.520]   Delilah becomes their secret agent
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.280]   and her name has become synonymous
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.640]   even today with seduction.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:10.720]   And she is often blamed for Satan's fall.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.040]   But we have to remember the context of it all.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.960]   She was merely doing her job
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.320]   as a loyal Philistine informant.
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.540]   She turned on the charm
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.640]   and Samson was very, very vulnerable.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.160]   In Judges 16, six to 16, we won't read it all.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:41.360]   We find Delilah pleading with Samson
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.800]   to reveal the secret of his strength.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.440]   I mean, I thought it should have been totally obvious
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:54.520]   or at least it should have been obvious
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.240]   that God was the source of Satan, Samson's strength.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.400]   The Philistines thought that Samson
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.380]   was using some kind of magic or some kind of illusion.
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:15.360]   And so we find Samson who is so wrapped up in love,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:22.160]   he thinks Delilah is just teasing him.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.660]   And so he playfully goes along,
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.220]   misleading her as though it were a big joke or something.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.780]   But as someone once said,
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.880]   Samson was playing a game with Delilah,
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.540]   which turned out to be Russian roulette.
[00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:47.320]   And he bought the bullet.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.280]   Now it's pretty obvious
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:55.080]   that Samson was infatuated with Delilah
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.980]   and he wasn't thinking straight.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:00.380]   And as someone else once said,
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:05.180]   rather than break his relationship with Delilah,
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.000]   he allowed it to break him.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.680]   I don't think that Samson really knew what love was.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:21.020]   And he simply couldn't resist Delilah's allure and persuasion.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.300]   And so he gives the enemy the answer
[00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:33.300]   they have been looking for in Judges 16, 18.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:38.060]   And Judges 16, 19 tells us this,
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.660]   after putting him to sleep on her lap,
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.480]   she called for someone to shave off
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   the seven braids of his hair and so began to subdue him.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.260]   And his strength left him.
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:04.220]   My friends, he had a QB house number zero.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.860]   I know 'cause I had one yesterday.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:13.340]   Now it's commonly believed that it was Delilah
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.860]   who cut off Samson's hair,
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.280]   but that's not what the text or this picture says.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.620]   The text clearly tells us
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.920]   that she called someone else to do it.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:35.380]   And then we come to one of the saddest verses
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.460]   in the whole Bible.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.660]   I wanna read it to you.
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:48.580]   Then she called, "Samson, the Philistines are upon you."
[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:54.060]   He awoke from his sleep and thought,
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.980]   I'll go out as before and shake myself free.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:05.060]   But he did not know that the Lord had left him.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:12.380]   But he did not know that the Lord had left him.
[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.000]   What a sad scene this is.
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.600]   You see, Samson lost his hair,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:27.880]   but he lost something else even more important.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:33.120]   He lost the presence of the Lord.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:39.240]   The one thing which showed that Samson belonged to God
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.240]   was his hair and he ended up losing that.
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:49.380]   He lost the presence of the Lord.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.040]   He lost his hair, but he lost the Lord's presence too.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:58.500]   Then the Philistines seized him,
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.240]   gouged out his eyes and took him to Gaza.
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.420]   Binding him with bronze shackles,
[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:13.100]   they set him to grinding grain in the prison,
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:18.100]   but the hair on his head began to grow again
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:24.780]   after it had been shaved.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.740]   Look at this picture.
[00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:33.020]   The Philistines were now full of themselves.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.540]   They capture Samson.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.780]   They cruelly gouge out his eyes
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.180]   and they throw him into a dark cell.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.500]   They put him to work grinding corn.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.620]   This was tedious and degrading labor,
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.380]   the kind of work that only slaves would perform.
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:21:00.540]   I believe that even though the Bible doesn't tell us this,
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:05.540]   that Samson's time in prison became a place
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:11.300]   and a time of his repentance.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.740]   Because the text very quietly tells us
[00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:19.800]   the hair on his head began to grow again.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.020]   It's almost as if the author of the judges
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:27.180]   is softly reminding us that God
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.200]   is not finished with Samson yet.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.660]   And his hair begins to grow.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.420]   Possibly his faith in God begins to grow too.
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:43.420]   After all, we find Samson listed
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.900]   in the Hebrews Hall of Faith.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.220]   Check it out, Hebrews 11, 32.
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.680]   Samson was a man who demonstrated what faith is.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:59.860]   And if that teaches us anything,
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:05.820]   it should teach us that the power of faith
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.300]   isn't the amount of faith we have,
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:16.420]   but the object of our faith, which is God.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:21.140]   Samson was helpless.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:27.020]   The Philistines had blinded him and he was put in chains.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.620]   Samson was in chains.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:37.480]   Now, Judges 16, 23 to 27 tells us
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.780]   that the Philistines threw a huge celebration
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:46.440]   at the temple of Dagon, which was their God of the grain.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.820]   As they were celebrating,
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:53.260]   as they were giving credit to their pagan gods,
[00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.900]   they brought Samson out to perform for them.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:02.580]   Now, what they didn't notice was that Samson's hair
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.220]   had begun to grow.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.620]   The famous preacher, Charles Spurgeon, C.H. Spurgeon,
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.100]   asked this, "I wonder why these Philistines
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.740]   "did not take care to keep his hair
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.820]   "from growing to any length.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:22.100]   "If cutting his hair once proved so effectual,
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.980]   "I wonder why they didn't send the barber in every morning
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.100]   "to make sure that not a hair grew
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.880]   "upon his scalp or his chin."
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:37.880]   And so, Samson asked to be propped up against the temple
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:47.280]   where he prayed to God for one last surge of strength.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.040]   Let's read it.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.020]   Then Samson prayed to the Lord.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:58.680]   "Sovereign Lord, remember me.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.080]   "Please, God.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.080]   "Strengthen me just one more, one more time,
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.080]   "just once more, and let me, with one blow,
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:17.300]   "get revenge on the Philistines for my two eyes."
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:22.640]   Pushing against the pillars,
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.740]   he literally brought the house down.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.500]   Now, I wanna finish this afternoon
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.180]   by going down a slightly different route.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:42.980]   I started off my Samson story
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:48.180]   by talking about the rather bizarre naming
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.020]   of my husky dog, Samson.
[00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:57.640]   Indeed, a number of recent Christian communicators
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.780]   and commentators have viewed Samson
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.580]   as a type of Jesus Christ,
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:09.860]   based on the similarities between Samson's story
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.380]   in the Old Testament and the life of Jesus
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.600]   in the New Testament.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.620]   A word of warning, we gotta be careful
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:22.220]   not to take this analogy too far.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.660]   But look at this, I've put it on your screen.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.820]   (silence)
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.420]   Thank you, Bonnie.
[00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:35.420]   Samson and Jesus' birth were both foretold by angels
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:41.060]   who predicted that they would save their people.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:46.900]   Samson was born to a barren woman.
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.440]   Jesus was born of a virgin.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.060]   Samson defeated a lion.
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:59.140]   Jesus defeated Satan, whom one Peter describes
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:03.820]   as a roaring lion waiting for someone to devour.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:09.820]   Samson's betrayal by Delilah has been compared
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.660]   to Jesus' betrayal by Judas Iscariot.
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:20.160]   Both Delilah and Judas were paid in pieces of silver
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.180]   for their respective deeds.
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.380]   Samson was blindfolded, insulted,
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:29.740]   and enslaved prior to his death.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.440]   Jesus, as you know, was blindfolded, insulted,
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.420]   and treated as a slave prior to his crucifixion.
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:43.620]   And we can also compare Samson's death among the wicked
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:50.880]   with Christ being crucified between two fields.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.220]   Two fields.
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.960]   Let's get back to the scene.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.460]   With the temple filled with Philistine leaders
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.860]   and 3,000 more people on the roof,
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:12.220]   Samson killed many more Philistines in this one act
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.600]   than he had done previously.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.880]   This was to be his final act,
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.320]   as Samson asked that he should die.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:32.800]   It could be said that Samson gave his life for his people.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:41.180]   I know someone else like that.
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:46.560]   His name is Jesus.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:52.420]   And I know he brought the power of sin and death
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.860]   in my life some 40 years ago.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:02.020]   He is breaking those entailing sins,
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.800]   those attitudes, my self-centeredness,
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   and still is, he is not finished with me yet,
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.220]   and he is not finished with you yet.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:21.220]   By the grace of God, and only by the grace of God,
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.780]   Samson fulfilled his calling.
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:32.600]   But the story of Samson ultimately points
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:38.460]   to the person of the ultimate chain breaker,
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.200]   Jesus Christ.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.780]   We sing the song, don't we?
[00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.060]   We'll sing it in a minute.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.860]   There is power in the name of Jesus
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:53.180]   to break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:29:00.140]   In his dying, Jesus did more than topple
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:05.200]   over an inanimate statue and slay his thousands.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.020]   In his dying, he destroyed our death,
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.940]   and in his rising, he restored our life.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:19.940]   Now, my friends, that is breaking chains.
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.980]   Delivered by our chain breaker
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.700]   from the fearsome reign of death,
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:31.100]   we are now free to walk in the light of life.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.940]   But important as it is,
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:40.480]   it is not just about being free from our sins.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.000]   It's not just about saying the sinner's prayer
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.640]   and moving from death to life.
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.820]   And I do recommend it.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.000]   If you haven't done that,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.060]   we'll give you an opportunity tonight.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:57.080]   But that is the beginning and not the end.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:03.880]   Even breaking the sins which as Christians entangle us,
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.000]   and that is also very important, I encourage it.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.240]   It is not the end game.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.940]   You see, and the point I want to make is this.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:21.500]   The chains are broken for us,
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.780]   but I've come to tell you today,
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:29.920]   the chains are broken through us.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.920]   Let me say that again.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.980]   Chains are broken for us
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.800]   so that chains can be broken through us.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:45.360]   God's purpose in the book of Judges,
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.620]   indeed the whole Old Testament,
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:52.420]   was to redeem Israel, to bring them back to him,
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.320]   to establish them as his people,
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.440]   to give them a new land,
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.300]   a new relationship through worship,
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.680]   to birth a new nation, a new people.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:08.640]   And 2,000 years ago,
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.800]   God sent his son, Jesus Christ,
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.580]   to be our redeemer, our chain breaker.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:23.920]   And in the year 2020,
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:29.720]   he sends us.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:33.940]   He sends his church.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.600]   He sends us.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:41.060]   I want to repeat, chains are broken for us
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:45.060]   so that chains may be broken through us.
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:50.280]   Chains of injustice, chains of poverty.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.060]   Alex shared it with us.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.880]   Chains of lack of freedom.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:59.380]   We cannot turn a blind eye.
[00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:05.340]   So what I want to do, I want to pray for us.
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.380]   And in that prayer,
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:13.200]   I want to pray for anyone who wants to come to Jesus,
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.840]   to ask Jesus to break my chains,
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:25.160]   to break sin, to break the power of sin.
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:30.220]   And that's what happens when we pass from death to life.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.160]   That's what happens when we put our trust in Jesus.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.700]   And if you've not done that, do so this evening.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.640]   Have those chains broken.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.640]   But secondly, I want to pray that God would set us free.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.540]   And I believe we're all in this position.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.840]   Set us free from entangling sins.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:59.780]   But thirdly, I want to pray that God would use me, use us,
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:03.720]   to break chains in others.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:09.540]   The poor, the needy, the refugee,
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:15.820]   that we would break the chains of injustice, poverty,
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.300]   and lack of freedom.
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:25.820]   So I'm gonna pray now, and then Kelly's gonna come back,
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.820]   and we're gonna sing, "There is power in the name of Jesus."
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:35.940]   So break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:36.780]   Let's pray.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:42.320]   Father, I want to pray now for anyone who is tuning in
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.640]   or is watching the YouTube
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.920]   and who doesn't know you as Lord and Savior.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.040]   And we recognize Jesus that you're the Son of God.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.840]   We recognize Jesus that you died for our sins.
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:57.260]   And tonight, Lord Jesus, I confess my sins.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:58.900]   Would you come into my life?
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.400]   Would you transfer me from the kingdom of death
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.640]   to the kingdom of life?
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:10.760]   And Lord Jesus, as I ask you to be my Lord and Savior,
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.240]   would you help me to live a life that pleases you?
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:19.480]   I receive you, Jesus, tonight as my Lord and Savior.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.120]   And Lord, we know that all of us,
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:28.040]   100% of us on this call, 100% of us online are sinners.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.820]   And it is only by the grace of God that we stand here.
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:37.000]   But Lord, you know it's our desire to break those things.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.760]   We sin time and time again with the same thing.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.400]   We keep coming back like Samson did.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.320]   And it may not be the same as Samson,
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:48.720]   but it might be about something else.
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:50.240]   It might be about pride.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.700]   It might be about power.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.240]   It might be about money.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:57.000]   Lord Jesus, that you would break sin in my life.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And Lord, that you would use me
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.680]   to break the chains in other people.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.360]   Lord, that I would step out for the poor, the oppressed,
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.600]   the ones that are suffering injustice,
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.360]   that you would use me as an agent of your freedom.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:21.360]   And I pray this in and through the mighty name of Jesus.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.740]   And we all say amen as we sing this song together.
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.800]   you
