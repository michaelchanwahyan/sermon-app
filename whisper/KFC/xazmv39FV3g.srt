00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Good night, everyone.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Good night.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 I almost wanted to say, all right, good night, we're done.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 All right, let's do it again.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Good evening, everyone.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 All right, not yet nighttime, but it is nighttime.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 I'm so excited to be sharing the word of God with you tonight.

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Now, you know one thing that can really damage us is how we feel about ourselves.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Now, we can't be happy about ourselves.

 We can't be happy about ourselves.

109
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

110
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

111
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

112
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

113
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

114
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

115
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

116
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

117
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

118
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

119
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

120
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

121
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

122
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

123
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

124
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

125
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

126
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 We can't be happy about ourselves.

127
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,760
 It's judgmental, it's critical, it's finger pointing.

128
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,840
 And yet, this is not the world that God wants for us.

129
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,160
 What is God's kingdom for us?

130
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,680
 Is for acceptance and grace in the midst of our imperfections.

131
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,120
 And that's why we need Jesus.

132
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,480
 And so today we're going to look at Mary Magdalene and how Jesus interacted with her so that

133
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
 we can understand.

134
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,880
 How is it that he has accepted her so that we can be accepted by him as well and that

135
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,280
 we can extend that acceptance to other people around us.

136
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
 Now who is Mary Magdalene anyways?

137
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,760
 Well, she has appeared in the gospel for 12 times.

138
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,080
 And she was most likely called Magdalene because she lived in Magdala.

139
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,920
 And it is in the western side.

140
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,040
 If you like, here's a map for those who like maps.

141
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,480
 It's on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee.

142
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,680
 And people used to call themselves by where they live so that we can differentiate which

143
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,720
 Mary it is.

144
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,340
 And there are quite a few in the Bible.

145
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,840
 And so from Luke 8, let's look at it together where the beginning of when we hear about

146
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
 Mary.

147
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,040
 Now in Luke 8 verse 1 to 3 it says here, "Jesus traveled about from one town and village to

148
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,320
 another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God.

149
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:51,320
 The 12 were with him and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases.

150
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,760
 Mary called Magdalene from whom seven demons had come out.

151
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,800
 Joanna, the wife of Chuza, and the manager of Harold's household.

152
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,760
 Susanna and many others.

153
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,800
 These women were helping to support them out of their own means."

154
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:15,000
 Now interesting to note that Jesus actually didn't always just traveled with his disciples.

155
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,440
 In this case, he traveled with a bunch of women as well.

156
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
 And who are these women?

157
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,760
 They have been healed and delivered from Jesus of demons or different diseases.

158
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,480
 But none of them were spelled out except the one that Mary Magdalene.

159
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,120
 And she was possessed by seven demons.

160
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,360
 That's what we know about her.

161
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,000
 Now they were not there just to watch and learn from Jesus.

162
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,280
 They were there actually to provide for him.

163
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,500
 And Mary Magdalene was one of them.

164
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,120
 Now can you imagine, does anybody have any idea what it's like to be demon possessed?

165
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,000
 Okay.

166
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,600
 None of us have had that experience.

167
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,040
 And we wonder what does that look like?

168
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,640
 Well if we reference to other gospels, we're going to see that there had been two demon

169
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,000
 possessed men recorded before.

170
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,520
 And they were violent.

171
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
 And they were out of their mind.

172
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,440
 They even slashed themselves and they were not wearing any clothes.

173
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,880
 And they were yelling out all the time.

174
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:24,000
 So what we do find is that those who are demon possessed most likely had an external manifestation.

175
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,240
 Somebody knew that that person was demon possessed.

176
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,920
 So it wasn't like an internal issue.

177
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,000
 It was an external one that everyone saw.

178
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,960
 But what was Jesus' heart?

179
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,200
 Did he despise her?

180
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,760
 Did he reject her?

181
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
 No.

182
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,000
 We saw that Jesus healed her.

183
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,720
 He had the mercy for her.

184
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,600
 And afterwards allowed her to stay with the rest of them.

185
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,200
 Now he could have easily said, "Oh, I don't want to be associated with someone who had

186
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:03,740
 been demon possessed just in case other people thought he was or his disciples was."

187
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,480
 So this brings us to our first point, that Jesus has a heart to accept the rejected by

188
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,680
 staying close to them.

189
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,400
 Now Mary was someone that people probably gossiped around, talked about, maybe in front

190
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,840
 of her or right behind her back.

191
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,680
 Maybe because of her gender, her social acceptance, or what has happened, the seven demons, you

192
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,860
 know the person with the seven demons, that's her.

193
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,400
 And people didn't want to be associated with her.

194
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,940
 But Jesus accepted her.

195
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,280
 Why is it that Jesus is able to accept her?

196
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,900
 Was it because she has done anything right?

197
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,120
 Probably not.

198
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,960
 It was because Jesus was full of love and compassion.

199
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,440
 Now most of us here, or none of us, has ever been demon possessed.

200
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:05,600
 But all of us probably have had a past or a struggle or some sort of failure.

201
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,440
 Now no doubt when that happens, it'll put a question in our mind.

202
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,240
 Are we good enough?

203
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,720
 Am I really that bad?

204
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,600
 When things are happening, don't those things repeat in your mind?

205
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,540
 And in case self-doubt wasn't detrimental enough, you know what the demon does?

206
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:33,040
 He puts a few people, not a lot, you know, just a few people around you.

207
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,040
 And they'll make sure you know what's wrong with you.

208
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,400
 They might blame you, right out say you're not good enough, or even say it's your fault.

209
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,960
 If you didn't do that, this wouldn't have happened.

210
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,560
 So whatever it is you're going through, some people might even say maybe she has done something

211
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,520
 wrong, that's why she was demon possessed.

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,520
 But you see, Jesus is not like that.

213
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:02,560
 He doesn't define us by what we're doing or what we're going through or what's happening.

214
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,880
 He defines us by the fact that we are sons and daughters of the living God.

215
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,400
 He loves us immensely.

216
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:21,360
 And so when we've received this kind of acceptance, it begs the question, do we extend this kind

217
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,880
 of acceptance to the people around us?

218
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,480
 Now like the Pharisees, they're unlike Jesus, right?

219
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,200
 What do the Pharisees do?

220
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 They stay away.

221
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,880
 They said, this is an unclean person.

222
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,080
 This person is of low status.

223
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,520
 I don't want to be associated with them.

224
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,240
 Instead, what do they say?

225
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,480
 Look at me.

226
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,800
 Look at how good I am.

227
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,520
 I can recite the scripture backwards.

228
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,160
 I don't have this issue with this thing.

229
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,040
 I don't have this sickness.

230
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,440
 I'm good.

231
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,560
 I'm better.

232
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,480
 So when we have accepted Jesus and see how he has accepted us, we need to be careful

233
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,280
 and examine our hearts.

234
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:13,520
 Are we standing in a place of judgment for others?

235
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,040
 Now growing up, I was never a popular kid.

236
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,040
 I often spoke my ideas and they might be disregarded.

237
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
 I didn't quite have it together.

238
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,560
 My father passed away when I was nine, and I was fatherless since then.

239
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,840
 And I immigrated to Canada.

240
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,040
 I think I only spoke 10 words of English when I arrived.

241
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,920
 I wasn't fluent for sure.

242
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,120
 And I wasn't sporty enough, and I definitely wasn't tall enough to play any sports where

243
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,000
 people might actually think I'm good at it.

244
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,200
 And really for the longest time, I was single.

245
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,800
 And even after getting married, it took so much effort to make things work.

246
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,960
 And even as a pastor, I'm a female, and I'm green.

247
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,160
 I don't have much experience.

248
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720
 I don't have it all together.

249
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,400
 And sometimes I too struggle with feeling accepted.

250
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:27,440
 And yet, whenever it is that I turn to my father in heaven, I know that I'm fully accepted

251
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,760
 for who I am.

252
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,000
 Is it because I'm perfect?

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Definitely not.

254
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,440
 It is only because he loves me.

255
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,760
 And I want to say that's the same thing for you.

256
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,160
 No matter what it is that you're going through or has been going through, don't let that

257
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,000
 be a stigma.

258
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,080
 He doesn't define you by those things.

259
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:57,640
 He defines you because he loves you and has fully accepted you.

260
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,400
 And I'm so thankful that in my life, there has been other people who have exemplified

261
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,960
 that kind of acceptance.

262
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,960
 Of course, you know, he's already patting on his shoulder.

263
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,760
 How do you know this, Charles?

264
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,640
 Pastor John's one of them.

265
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
 Sandra.

266
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,120
 Whenever I might be in self-doubt, they give me that big hug that I think my bones are

267
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,160
 going to crush sometimes.

268
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,320
 And even when I'm not doubting, they give me that hug.

269
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,720
 Or I have my seminary teacher.

270
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,160
 And whenever I go to him, I'm like, I'm not sure about this.

271
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
 He would guide me.

272
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,600
 He would help me.

273
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,280
 Even though I've graduated two years, I think he must be thinking, wow, this person never

274
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,920
 going to stop coming.

275
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
 I'm sure not.

276
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
 I'm sure not.

277
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:51,400
 He's very thankful and just accepting of where I am.

278
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,600
 And of course, there are many of you guys too that I'm able to connect.

279
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:02,680
 And you've asked me out for dinners, going over to your places, and just connect.

280
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,040
 You would invite me, my husband, Isabella.

281
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,480
 We'll all go.

282
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,600
 And by the way, if you invite my extended family, I'll bring them all over too.

283
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,040
 And I really sense that acceptance.

284
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,080
 I want to say we all need people around us to accept us.

285
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,800
 And sometimes we might be the one that's struggling.

286
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,520
 We can go to God.

287
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:35,120
 But at the same time, we can be that person that tells other people that, hey, we accept

288
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,120
 you.

289
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,600
 We see where you are, and we love you.

290
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,080
 We can be that person for other people.

291
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:50,520
 And so let us accept those who are rejected or feeling rejected by staying close to them.

292
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,880
 Now as we read on, there's another record of Mary Magdalene in the gospel.

293
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:02,680
 And it is in John chapter 20, where Mary alone experiences the first and the most profound

294
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,080
 moment where she sees the resurrected Jesus.

295
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,640
 Now it was right after that Jesus was crucified, and he was laid in his tomb.

296
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,640
 And it was dark that night, and Mary went there.

297
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,480
 And she was trying to see Jesus.

298
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,520
 But she saw that the tombstone was open.

299
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,760
 So he ran straight to his disciples.

300
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,520
 Simon, Peter, and another person, most likely disciple John.

301
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,640
 And what happened was they all rushed over to see what happened.

302
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,780
 And when they saw that the tombstone was open, they believed.

303
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,360
 And the disciples went back to where they were.

304
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,600
 But Mary stayed there, and she was weeping.

305
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,580
 And that's where the scripture that we heard Bonnie read earlier.

306
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,440
 She was crying in the tomb.

307
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,320
 She doesn't know where the Lord is.

308
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,240
 And yet there are two angels that were inside.

309
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,080
 And they asked her, "Why are you crying?"

310
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,240
 She said, "I don't know.

311
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,080
 Somebody took Jesus.

312
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,120
 Can you tell me where he is?"

313
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,760
 And so let's read this together.

314
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,000
 John 20, from verse 14 to 18.

315
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,400
 At this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there.

316
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
 This is Mary.

317
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,540
 But she did not realize that it was Jesus.

318
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,560
 He asked her, "Women, why are you crying?

319
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,080
 Who is it that you're looking for?"

320
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:35,600
 "Thinking he was a gardener," she said, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where

321
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,760
 you have put him, and I will get him."

322
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,900
 Jesus said to her, "Mary."

323
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:48,960
 She turned towards him and cried out in Aramaic, "Rabboni," which means "teacher."

324
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,320
 Jesus said, "Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father.

325
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:02,100
 Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father,

326
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,560
 to my God and your God.'"

327
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,440
 Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news.

328
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,940
 "I have seen the Lord."

329
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:15,620
 And she told them that he had said these things to her.

330
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:22,020
 You see, Mary Magdalene, she was crying and thought Jesus was the gardener.

331
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,700
 Who would have taken Jesus, she thought.

332
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,500
 But Jesus told her, as he says, "Mary."

333
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,620
 She recognizes him right away.

334
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,500
 Now this verse, one verse is a little bit hard.

335
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,300
 Why is it that Jesus has told her, "Don't hold on to me yet, for I have not ascended

336
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,300
 to the Father."

337
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
 What does that mean?

338
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:52,220
 Well, it's likely because Jesus' permanent form has not come about yet.

339
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:57,380
 And she's telling her in this spiritual sense, "Don't hold on to this current me.

340
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,480
 I'm going to come back with a permanent form.

341
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,820
 You cannot hold on to what it is now.

342
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,280
 Things will change."

343
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,880
 And this dialogue, what we see is Jesus accepting someone in sorrow.

344
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,380
 He was definitely finishing off a very important mission.

345
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:21,600
 FYI, salvation is a very important mission.

346
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,960
 He has already finished crucifixion.

347
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:29,300
 He has risen, but he did not go to the Father yet to come back.

348
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:36,980
 And yet, he's willing to stop for someone, someone very special.

349
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,000
 Mary Magdalene, who was in sorrow.

350
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,620
 And so this brings us to our second point, that Jesus has a heart to accept the sorrowful

351
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,000
 by empathizing with them.

352
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,480
 You know, it's one thing to care for someone, but it's another thing to accept their sorrow.

353
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,400
 Now in this age and time, we're probably too busy, too unempathetic towards people who

354
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,880
 are in pain.

355
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:11,360
 And a lot of times what we'll say is, "I'll pray for you, and then we'll leave."

356
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,520
 And a lot of times, even when people are in sorrow, we might be judging them and think,

357
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
 "What's wrong?

358
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,320
 It's only a small matter.

359
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,140
 Why are you crying over this?"

360
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,780
 And anybody in your situation, they'll take care of it like that.

361
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,280
 What is wrong with you?

362
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:36,080
 Do we have that empathetic sense to be feeling where they're feeling?

363
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,160
 And obviously, you know, for Jesus, he already knows what's going to happen, right?

364
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,760
 He knows in about a few days' time, he's going to come back.

365
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,160
 You know, if I were Jesus, maybe I'll go like, "Okay, I know she's crying, but it'll only

366
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,480
 be for a few more days.

367
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,520
 Let me finish off this really important mission.

368
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,680
 I'll come back."

369
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,480
 But Jesus is not like that.

370
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:07,800
 In your most painful moment, he stops everything for you because he accepts your sorrow, and

371
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,880
 he's not going to judge that.

372
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,360
 And so when we're in pain, even if no one understands, we know we can go to him and

373
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,840
 he will accept us.

374
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,440
 You know, emotions doesn't have right or wrong.

375
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,220
 It's just there.

376
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:31,120
 And the difference between empathy and sympathy, I think we've talked about it before, but

377
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,280
 I want to say it again, is because empathy is really being in another person's shoes

378
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:42,080
 and trying to feel what they're feeling, not being in their shoes and feeling what you

379
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
 think they're feeling.

380
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,560
 You're trying to feel that.

381
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,000
 And sympathy really is just saying, "I have pity, and you know what?

382
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,840
 I'm thankful it's not happening to me."

383
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,440
 Sympathy.

384
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,800
 And so here we see that the heart of Jesus is to accept.

385
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,300
 Now one of my best friend, and she's here tonight, but I won't point her out.

386
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,740
 She doesn't like it.

387
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,960
 She always empathizes with me when I'm in sorrow.

388
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,920
 Whenever I'm in my deepest sorrow, I go to her and I cry.

389
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,040
 And sometimes I'm surprised because we might be praying, and by the time I open my eyes,

390
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,220
 she's crying as well.

391
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,000
 And when I'm angry, she's angry with me.

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,680
 And we can be angry together.

393
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,800
 No angry birds, right?

394
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:38,920
 And in front of her, I never felt for a moment that my tears would be judged or my frustrations

395
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:46,240
 would be judged, because she accepted that in that moment, that's what I felt.

396
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,040
 And I feel like we can all be like that for someone.

397
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:56,320
 Rather than just accepting how God accepts our feelings and emotions, would we also be

398
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,960
 that person for someone else?

399
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,300
 Don't judge.

400
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,320
 Don't say, "Well, you've brought it onto yourself, so there you go."

401
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,660
 No.

402
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:12,800
 Just try to feel what they're feeling.

403
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,000
 And as a new mom, that's sometimes not easy for me.

404
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,320
 And there has been nights where I get my milk bottle ready.

405
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,000
 My little one back there, in case you don't know, it's six months old.

406
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,260
 Her name is Isabella.

407
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,880
 And I would try to give her the milk, and she won't have it.

408
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,160
 I put it in her mouth, and she goes like...

409
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
 She's really good at dodging.

410
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,920
 So one day, I think she can play dodgeball or something.

411
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,300
 So she dodges it.

412
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,300
 And there I am.

413
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,400
 And this is 1 AM.

414
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,160
 In my head, I'm thinking, "All right.

415
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,880
 Mommy's only doing this not because it's fun, but I want you to grow up nice and strong

416
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,280
 and tall, okay?"

417
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,600
 So there I am doing this the whole time I'm thinking this.

418
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,600
 And I'm like, "You know what?

419
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:00,800
 Let's have this milk so we can both go to bed, okay?"

420
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,040
 And so just when I'm about to say it, I swallow it back down.

421
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,960
 Because I'm thinking, "I'm not this baby.

422
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,320
 Do I remember or know what it feels like to be eating only one kind of food for six months?

423
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,480
 Does anybody remember what it feels like to only drink milk for six months?"

424
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,500
 I know we've all done it, but none of us remember.

425
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,920
 And so even as a baby, when she can't speak, I'm trying to sympathize with her that in

426
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,040
 this moment in time, I don't want milk.

427
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,400
 And so I'll be, "Okay, no milk.

428
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,400
 Let's go to bed."

429
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,400
 And maybe I said goodnight at the very beginning.

430
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,720
 And I wonder, can we sympathize with the people around us?

431
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,440
 And I'm not saying we need to do that for everybody, because some people can really

432
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,360
 talk and talk and talk and talk, and we can't.

433
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,480
 But can we start with the people around us first?

434
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,920
 What about our parents when they're upset?

435
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,320
 Like, "Why are you still staying up?"

436
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,160
 They're like, "I don't care.

437
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,600
 Just let me do my thing."

438
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,680
 Will we for a moment sympathize, not sympathize, empathize with them?

439
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,360
 They love me so much.

440
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,160
 Or when our spouse, when they're crying, instead of like, "Okay, I have to go watch TV and

441
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,400
 just ignore."

442
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,880
 Can we just stay there and say, "Hey, what are you feeling?

443
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,340
 Tell me all about it."

444
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,280
 And same thing when it's our child.

445
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,840
 Maybe we've said something to anger them, and they look like they're very upset about

446
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
 it.

447
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,640
 Are we just gonna ignore it or try to feel what they're feeling?

448
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,280
 What is it that I have said that has upset you?

449
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,800
 Would we do that?

450
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:57,360
 Now from the same passage in John, we see that there's also an interesting countercultural

451
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
 action that Jesus has done.

452
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,440
 Jesus said to Mary in verse seven, "Go instead to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending

453
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:12,560
 to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"

454
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:20,640
 Now this good news about the risen Lord was actually given to a woman.

455
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:30,400
 Now not only any woman, but a woman who has once been possessed by seven demons.

456
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,520
 And it shows that God is not showing partiality, that he's willing to commission whosoever

457
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,020
 heart is pointed towards Jesus.

458
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:49,000
 So this brings us to our third point, that Jesus' heart to accept even the lowly by commissioning

459
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 them.

460
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,080
 Of all the people in the world that you would choose to be the first person to see the resurrected

461
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,440
 Jesus, who would it be?

462
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,200
 I don't know, you may say Peter, John, right?

463
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,800
 At least pick one of the disciples.

464
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:18,120
 But no, Jesus picked Mary Magdalene, someone with a past, someone who was demon possessed.

465
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,280
 Now this is out of your mind, right?

466
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,480
 First she was a woman.

467
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
 And what did that mean?

468
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,280
 Especially in such a male dominated world.

469
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:33,400
 It meant that her words were not credible at all.

470
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:38,900
 And at that time, most of the women did not have any education.

471
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,400
 So she probably didn't write or read.

472
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,760
 And the third thing, she was demon possessed.

473
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,120
 Now if you were going to say the Lord has risen, does that sound crazy?

474
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,080
 It sounded pretty crazy.

475
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,200
 People might say, "Oh my goodness, she's demon possessed again."

476
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:06,040
 So why would Jesus still entrust this important message for Mary Magdalene to preach back

477
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,060
 to the disciples?

478
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,500
 It is because he shows no partiality.

479
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:23,500
 For us humans, we see people by their appearance and see if they're the elite ones.

480
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,080
 But God looks at a person's heart.

481
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,340
 And so it doesn't matter whatever things you're going through or has been through, if you

482
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,740
 think you're lesser of someone or if someone tells you outright that you're lesser of someone,

483
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,220
 don't let that discourage you.

484
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:54,100
 As long as you love the Lord, he will commission you no matter what because he sees the heart.

485
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,220
 And so we might fall into the same trap.

486
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:07,140
 As we accept fully from what God accepts us for, do we also extend that acceptance to

487
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,140
 someone else?

488
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:14,980
 I mean, it's very easy for us to always find the people who seem to have it all together

489
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,980
 to do this or to do that.

490
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,420
 Oh, that person, let's not find her.

491
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,820
 Let's not find him.

492
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,940
 It's very easy for us humans to do that.

493
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,980
 But let us be accepting like the Lord.

494
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,060
 If that person loves the Lord, let them try.

495
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
 Let them do it.

496
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,220
 If they don't have enough of the training or background, let's give it to them.

497
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,460
 And so a few years back, I was serving at a church and something happened.

498
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,980
 So a bunch of people left and I was serving as one of the worship leaders.

499
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,700
 I know I was serving.

500
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,940
 And we didn't have enough people to be there.

501
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:56,620
 And so I looked around and I saw people who loved the Lord.

502
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,640
 They really loved him.

503
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,520
 And they're singing their hearts out every time when we were worshiping.

504
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,580
 So I went ahead and I asked, "Hey, would you guys like to be on the worship team?"

505
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,100
 And they're like, "Can we?"

506
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,900
 I was like, "Do you love the Lord?"

507
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,900
 "Yeah."

508
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,900
 "Do you like to worship?"

509
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
 "Yeah."

510
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,220
 "All right, you're on."

511
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,220
 But they're not your usual worship team.

512
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:24,540
 Now, I would say all of them were 55 and above.

513
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,100
 And some of them retiring or have retired.

514
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,300
 No musical training.

515
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,300
 Never been on stage.

516
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,860
 They don't know the first thing about worship.

517
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,980
 But you know what?

518
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,900
 They have the heart.

519
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
 Let's go for it.

520
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,020
 So I still remember vividly, I got seven of them.

521
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,580
 I was teaching them the keyboard.

522
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,940
 And they had these rolled out portable keyboards.

523
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,200
 They were so cute doing those.

524
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,060
 And then we had drum lessons we learned together.

525
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,540
 And even back then, I've only learned drums for a year.

526
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,100
 We did it.

527
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,500
 And then everybody-- OK, I have to tell you the reality.

528
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,900
 The reality was none of them mastered the keyboards.

529
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,060
 One person could play the drum.

530
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,580
 But all of them were able to sing.

531
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:22,340
 And we had these worship nights where it was just spirit-filled.

532
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,040
 And I still remember one of them coming to me and saying, "Michelle, thank you so much

533
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,540
 for trusting us.

534
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,300
 I mean, nobody in a million years would ask us to be on the worship team."

535
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:42,140
 And I just want to say, God will commission you when your heart loves him.

536
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,900
 He shows no partiality.

537
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,340
 And at the same time, let us learn from him, too.

538
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,260
 Raise up more people.

539
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,300
 Different people can serve in different positions.

540
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,260
 So come forward.

541
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,440
 This is a recruitment process, I think.

542
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,940
 Come forward when that is in your heart.

543
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:12,220
 So tonight, I just wanted all of us to see how Jesus accepted Mary Magdalene.

544
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:19,340
 She was someone with a past, a female, someone of lower status.

545
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,540
 And yet Jesus accepted her.

546
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:26,460
 Jesus kept her close.

547
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,420
 Jesus empathized with her sorrow.

548
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:35,060
 And Jesus commissioned her, the very first person.

549
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,180
 And when she was commissioned, you know what that did?

550
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:45,880
 It was telling the disciples as well, and the whole world to us, that she is no lesser

551
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,820
 than anybody else.

552
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:54,620
 So that even when he were to be in heaven and not physically be on earth, that they

553
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,740
 would treat her as an equal.

554
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,940
 So rather you have failed an exam or didn't get to a school or didn't graduate, or you

555
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:10,380
 grew up in a single parent home, or you have been battling with illness, whether it's mentally

556
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:17,100
 or physically, or if you have went through a divorce or if you're going through one,

557
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:24,540
 if you have struggles with your kids or finances or finding a job, please, don't let that

558
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,660
 stop you from feeling the acceptance of God.

559
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,900
 You are not defined by these things.

560
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,140
 And I have to say it again.

561
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,620
 You are not defined by these things.

562
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:44,860
 You are defined by the fact that you are a daughter and a son of God.

563
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:50,460
 You are a son and a daughter of the living God.

564
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,380
 And that's your definition.

565
00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:06,740
 And so I pray that we will, in times of when we feel unsure or in doubt, reach out to God.

566
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,460
 Let his acceptance fill you up.

567
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,020
 And at the same time, accept the people around us.

568
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,300
 Now in a moment, we're going to sing a response song called "You Say."

569
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:25,740
 And one line really catches my attention, which is, "Am I really just the sum of my

570
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,540
 highs and lows?"

571
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,540
 What is your value?

572
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,220
 How are you defined?

573
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:40,500
 Let us define not by what other people say, not even how you view yourself, but what God

574
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,340
 says about you.

575
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:50,740
 And he says he loves you, he accepts you, and he'll continue to be with you until the

576
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,780
 end of time.

577
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,900
 Let us pray together.

578
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:07,780
 Dear Heavenly Father, we don't know how you can love us this way.

579
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:13,140
 I think it is because you made us.

580
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,780
 You made us.

581
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:22,300
 And you love us despite our flaws, our imperfections, and even our sins have been taken care of

582
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,500
 with the blood of Jesus.

583
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,980
 What more can we ask for from a God?

584
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:37,620
 And so Father, I pray that, especially for those who are hurting, who don't feel accepted,

585
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:43,060
 that Father, may your Spirit fill us up.

586
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,860
 It doesn't matter what people say.

587
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,540
 It only matters what you say.

588
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:56,380
 Father, may we hold on to that and also extend that acceptance to the people around us.

589
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,980
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

590
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:08,980
