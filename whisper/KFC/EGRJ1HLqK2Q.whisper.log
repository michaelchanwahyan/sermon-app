[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.480]   Now, we're going to move into our sermon segment, and we're going to do this slightly differently.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.540]   And the title for today's talk is Tracing Our Steps As We Walk Ahead.
[00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.840]   Tracing Our Steps As We Walk Ahead.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.600]   And we're actually going to do it as a group effort, remembering the early church that
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.480]   there wasn't heavily reliant on maybe just one person bringing the word.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.080]   In the gatherings that defined the early church, we're recognising that we are all part of
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.080]   the body.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.640]   We all have different gifts, and we all have different things to bring to edify the body.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.320]   And what a great opportunity to give this a go during a season like this and Chinese
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.640]   New Year, where we all get to bring something slightly different.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.240]   And I titled this Tracing Our Steps As We Walk Ahead.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.320]   And I want to share with you a little story.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.920]   Last week, I went on a spiritual solitude retreat, and I went all the way to the New
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.200]   Territories. Hands up who has been to the New Territories recently.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:11.040]   For those of us who live on Hong Kong Island who think that Kowloon is far, then you don't
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.680]   know a thing. New Territories is even further.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.600]   My family are from a place called Yuen Long. So I went there, and I went to stay overnight
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.240]   in a place called Tin So Wai. Tin So Wai. Actually, it was a hotel that my family used
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.120]   to stay at when we used to visit back here.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.600]   And I woke up the next day, and then I decided just to go for a walk, just to see where the
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   Lord was taking me.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.800]   And I looked on Google Maps, and I saw a seafood fishing village nearby. So I thought, "Oh,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.520]   well, why don't I walk there?"
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.640]   And so I started walking there. And as I was walking down the road in this place called
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.320]   Lau Fau Sam, and as I was walking towards there, I started getting these childhood memories
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.760]   flashing back in my mind.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.360]   I started recognising the roads that I was walking along. And I was like, "Oh, I've been
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.440]   here before, but I'm not entirely sure why or what I was here for."
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.360]   And then as I kept walking, it dawned on me that actually this is the place where my grandparents
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.400]   were buried.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.080]   And so then I was like, "Oh, well, I'll just keep walking." And then eventually I found
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.880]   the place where they were actually buried.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.360]   And then, of course, it was a Buddhist temple. So I walked in, and then they were all on
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.720]   the wall, huge wall, and I had to walk around.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.280]   It took me probably a good hour to find the picture of my grandparents. And I told my
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.240]   mum, "Oh, look what I found." You know, I found my grandparents. And she was like, "Oh,
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.880]   actually, your great-grandparents are also nearby. So why don't you go and find them
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   as well?"
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.920]   And then another half an hour later, I found them as well. And as I was reflecting on this
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.040]   journey, and I was just sitting there in this Buddhist temple, and I was like, "Wow, I've
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.920]   come a long way, or my family have come a really long way."
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.880]   You know, just thinking back that actually my family were from China, from a county called
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:09.720]   Bao'an. And then eventually my great-grandparents moved to Hong Kong, settled in the new territories
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.960]   in Pingshan. And then from there, that's where my grandparents started to really kind of
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.680]   just settle down here.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.760]   Then my dad, I'm sure I've told you guys about my dad before, he was a high school dropout
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.320]   in Yuen Long, couldn't cut it, got sent away to Taiwan. And that was when he met Jesus.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.240]   And then he came back and then we ended up in the UK.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.760]   And then fast forward all these years, now I, as their grandchild, or as their great-grandchild,
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.240]   and sat there under the picture of my grandparents, and my great-grandparents, but this time as
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.960]   a Christian minister.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.760]   And I was thinking, "Wow, what a journey that my family has been on."
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.000]   And as I traced my steps, all I could see was God's hand. All I could see was God's
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.200]   faithfulness and God's goodness, and just this, His working for His glory.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.240]   And I thought, "What a great thing to talk about as we look and reflect on Chinese New
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.240]   Year."
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.040]   And there's really three questions that I've been asking myself when I've been thinking
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.760]   about us and the Chinese culture.
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.440]   There's one, where did we come from?
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.760]   Two, where are we right now?
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.360]   And three, where are we heading?
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.000]   So as we figure out what we're doing as a culture, as a people, as a nation, it's so
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.320]   helpful to trace our steps first, to see where we've come from, and then to recognise where
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.960]   we're at, and then to figure out where we should be heading.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.280]   And those are the three questions I wanted to really address with us today, and also
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.480]   ask these lovely people around me.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.560]   The first question is, where did we come from?
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.920]   At least in terms of our spirituality, our faith.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.480]   One of the earliest dynasties in the Chinese culture is the Shang Dynasty.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.280]   And the Shang Dynasty, I think, is the second one on record.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.760]   And the Shang Dynasty, they actually worshipped ancestors, and they treated them as demigods
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   almost.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:14.520]   But they also worshipped, ultimately, an OG ancestor, if you will, the ultimate ancestor
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.360]   at the very, very beginning of time.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.000]   Did you know that?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.880]   And do you know what they called this OG ancestor?
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.600]   This original ancestor?
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.200]   Shang Di.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.640]   Song Dai.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.720]   And that's who they worshipped.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.680]   They worshipped this force, this being called Shang Di.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.560]   And then of course, the Chinese culture has taken lots of different journeys from there.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.200]   It's gone from worshipping one being almost, to then worshipping many, many.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.840]   Now the Shang Dynasty actually existed in 1500 years before Confucius or Buddha were
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.640]   even born.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.020]   So this was way before then, but of course, Confucius was born, and Buddha, and then religions
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.320]   from India started coming in, and then they went from worshipping one thing to worshipping
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   many, many things.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.400]   They worshipped all these different things.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.040]   And then as time progressed, the Chinese culture eventually, maybe in the last century, have
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.640]   declared, especially in the mainland, that they are a culture that doesn't worship any
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.640]   god.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.720]   Cantonese is "mǒ sān lèng", there is no god.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.560]   And so we've gone from one god to many gods to no god.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:24.840]   And it makes me think, wow, what an interesting story that God is writing in all this.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.240]   And that's where we come from.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.760]   And where are we right now?
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.080]   Christianity is growing fast in the Chinese culture.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.080]   God is clearly moving.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.480]   We look at Hong Kong, we look at the churches here, we look at all the things that are going
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:38.480]   on.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:44.080]   We can say with certainty that God is alive and well, and that he is moving.
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.200]   And there's so much in our Chinese culture that is good.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   There is so much of it.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.000]   And actually, it's one of the questions I want to ask all of us here is, where can you
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.360]   see God in our Chinese culture?
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.080]   And I want to have you think to yourself, where did you come from?
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.360]   And actually, where are you right now, culturally, spiritually?
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:10.520]   The Chinese culture is steeped with just great things like honour, like integrity, like perseverance.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.680]   It's all in line with the teachings of the Bible.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.800]   Yet, of course, as mankind has progressed, as the Chinese, as a people, we have progressed,
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.280]   we have also deviated from the ways of God as well.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.000]   And there are many, many things that are now not of God within our culture too.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.720]   Things that strike fear into us, things that cause us to envy, things to fill us with pride,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.240]   putting our faith in the wrong kinds of things.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.320]   And so I think that's part of where we're at right now.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:46.000]   And my question really is, how are we to maintain an appreciation for our culture whilst also
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.840]   still honouring God and not compromising our faith?
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.320]   Chinese New Year is full of rituals and things that we have to do when we visit friends and
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:00.080]   family, when we meet younger people and we're forced to give them money, which I think is
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.760]   totally not of God and not evil, which is why we are resisting from giving these people
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.760]   red pockets.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.520]   Because it's just, I ask myself, is this really of God?
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.720]   Only joking, I'll give them something.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.320]   No, you can leave now.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.440]   But that question remains.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:23.040]   For those of us who are fully Chinese and fully Christians, how do we live out our faith
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:29.880]   in a way that both honours our culture, appreciates our culture, but also honours and loves our
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.440]   God and doesn't compromise in our faith?
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.680]   These are fascinating questions.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.920]   And finally, where should we be heading?
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.920]   Now we've evaluated where we came from and maybe some of the tensions and struggles that
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.600]   we have, what should we really be doing?
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.880]   As God is moving in our people, what should we be doing?
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.920]   How should our hearts be changed?
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.240]   How should our mindsets be shifted?
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.760]   And I was really just thinking about this and praying about this.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.760]   I was led to a book in the Bible that I thought actually has something very interesting to
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.560]   say to us.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.880]   And that book is one that we're very familiar with.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.880]   It's 1 Peter.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.120]   We just went through it and we probably went through it way too fast because there's so
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.120]   much good content there.
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.880]   But there's this passage that I wanted to read to us today, just to allow it to really
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.720]   seep into our minds and our hearts again.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.200]   And I'll read it to you.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.560]   And of course, Barney's very kindly put it on the screen for us as well.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.520]   1 Peter chapter 1, verse 14.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.400]   As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.200]   But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written,
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.960]   you shall be holy for I am holy.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.440]   And if you call on him as father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds,
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.440]   conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:54.680]   ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.800]   such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.800]   blemish or spot.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.600]   And you look at this passage and you actually think about actually the context in which
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.720]   this was written.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:16.280]   Peter writing to these new believers, seeped in the cultures that they were in.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:21.600]   And he's asking them and saying, hey, as obedient children, don't conform to these passions
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.120]   of your former ignorance.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.640]   Verse 17, you are to live out a new way of life now.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.440]   Why do they have to live out a new way?
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.120]   Why do they have to now be holy?
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:38.760]   Again, verse 17, because and if you call on him as father, that is why.
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:42.120]   You see, in the ancient world and actually very much in the Chinese world, the father
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.960]   is the one that has the say in the household.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.280]   Whatever the father says goes.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.360]   Everything is dictated and determined by the father.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:54.720]   And Peter saying here to these believers, hey, you have a new father now.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.800]   You're going to ask yourself that question.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.840]   Who's your daddy now?
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.720]   It isn't the ways of the world.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.280]   It isn't the idols of the world from the past.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.080]   You have a new father now.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.520]   And because of that father, that must impact the way you live.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.340]   It means that there are new rules to live by now because of this father.
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.680]   And so because of him, you have to transform.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.840]   You have to remind yourself, verse 18, knowing that you are ransomed from the futile ways
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.760]   inherited from your forefathers, knowing that you were ransomed.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:35.000]   You know, I always have this question, how is God redeeming the Chinese culture?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   How is he redeeming it?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.240]   Like, one of the things that we have now fallen short on, how is God redeeming it?
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.880]   And I realised, I think I was asking the wrong question.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:46.480]   Because actually, God, I don't think, redeems a culture.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.200]   He redeems us from the culture.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.000]   Do you get that?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.360]   He's not necessarily focused on the cultures, which are all man-made, but he seeks to redeem
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.520]   us from our cultures, from the things of man.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:08.120]   Because now, because of the blood of Jesus, we now belong to his house, his home, his
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.400]   kingdom, his culture.
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.640]   He has redeemed us from the world's culture and brought us into his family.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:21.560]   See, Jesus entered at a time where the most prominent and most powerful culture that has
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.360]   ever been on this earth was right in its prime.
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.400]   And have you ever wondered, why did Jesus choose that moment to come into this world,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:36.960]   to invade the world, and to set up his throne and to start something, start a kingdom, start
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:43.960]   a revolution that ended up outliving the most powerful empire, outliving, outlasting the
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   Roman culture?
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.200]   You see, Jesus came to this world not to necessarily dethrone the cultures of this world, not to
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.320]   necessarily dethrone the kingdoms of this world, but rather to show a new way, show
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.000]   that his way is even higher, and that the economies of this world are flipped upside
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.080]   down when it comes to the kingdom of heaven.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.760]   And he ended up starting something that was so much more transformational.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:12.640]   You see, God placed us here in our culture, I believe, to appreciate it, to honour it.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:18.840]   There are some beautiful, righteous things about the way that we live, but we're also
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.320]   needing to be careful in remembering that we are in this world, but we are not of this
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:29.600]   world, that we have been redeemed from the things that are not of God within our culture.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:36.840]   Romans 12, 2 says this, "Don't conform to the patterns of this world, but be transformed
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.960]   by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.800]   is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.720]   You see, for us as believers, and I feel strongly about this, is we as believers, we need to
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:56.160]   test ourselves constantly, check our hearts, and ask ourselves, what about our faith?
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   What about our lives has been influenced by the world?
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.440]   You know, there's a lot of talk about this, and recently I read a book called Pagan Christianity,
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.360]   which really forced me to think, where do the traditions, where do the practices that
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.480]   we have inherited come from?
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.520]   Are they really of God?
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.600]   We all need to ask the question, why do we do what we do?
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.640]   Is this righteous?
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.720]   Is this holy?
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   Is this of God?
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.880]   Because we have a Father in heaven now.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:29.480]   You see, the problem is, and I feel as though we all maybe have been guilty of this, is
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:35.520]   Christianity did convert the world, but I also wonder if the world ended up converting
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.640]   Christianity as well.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.160]   Maybe there are parts of our lives, maybe there's a part of our faith, our own mindset,
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:47.560]   our own psyche, that has been converted, that has been influenced by the world.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.960]   And God is calling us again and telling us, know that you were ransomed from your futile
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:57.160]   ways inherited from your forefathers, and I know for sure I have futile ways in my life.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.160]   I know for sure that I chase perishable things.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.920]   But reminding myself at this time of year that God has redeemed me, redeemed from that
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.880]   culture, from that way of thinking.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:16.240]   And so I wanted to really open that up to ask my lovely brothers and sisters here some
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.240]   of those questions.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.560]   And actually it's a great and fun way for us to get to know each other a little bit
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.360]   about where we come from.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.960]   And so the first question I want to do is direct to Florence over here.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.000]   Florence, where do you come from?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.800]   Where do your family come from?
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:35.360]   My family came from, so I came from my mom and my dad, who, surprise.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.360]   Great.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:42.600]   But my dad is from Maoming, which is around the Guangdong region.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.040]   And then my dad should be fact-checking this and I'm saying the wrong things.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.840]   And my mom is from Laozhou, which is around the Guangxi area.
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.400]   And then they both, as in my grandparents were from there, and then they escaped from
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   China to Hong Kong.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.240]   And then here we are.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240]   Okay.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.800]   So it's your grandparents that moved?
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.800]   Okay.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   They moved.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   Brilliant.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   And that's almost your cultural heritage.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   What about your spiritual heritage?
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   What's the journey as you trace your steps?
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.360]   Where did that come from?
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:23.520]   So my grandparents, they weren't Christians and I think some of them turned to other Buddhists
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.720]   or quite didn't think that there was a God.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.720]   And then, but my dad's grand, no, my dad's dad, when he first came to Hong Kong, he actually
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:38.320]   was, went to a Catholic church who then helped him a lot with just being, approving his like
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.800]   degree to be able to teach.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.440]   And as he met the church there, the father who was there, he got to know God.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.880]   So that was where we kind of first crossed paths with the Lord and the Lord has been
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.480]   gracious and revealing more to him just personally in our own family.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.480]   Wow.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:59.440]   You know, I find something that's really fascinating about us believers here in Hong Kong is that
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:05.600]   so many of us are actually first, second or maximum third generation believers, maximum.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:11.680]   And actually it doesn't take us tracing our steps too far back to find when God entered
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.000]   our family and when God was in, when Jesus was introduced to us, which is maybe different
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.600]   from the States where some of the pastors that I follow are seventh generation pastors.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.880]   So all their lineage comes from pastors.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.440]   It's just a, it's a different kind of experience and history that we have.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.440]   You know, that's fascinating.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.440]   Paul, where do you come from?
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.440]   Well, this is a little bit different.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.320]   So I was born and raised in Australia.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:48.440]   So my mum is first generation Australian and then with English and Scottish descent.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:56.920]   And then my dad is born Swiss and then moved to Australia when he was like early twenties.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:02.840]   So that's, I'm first generation Australian on one side and second on the other side.
[00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.840]   Oh, I see.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.320]   And what about your, what about your spiritual heritage?
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.640]   So I grew up in a Christian home.
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:15.400]   So I was going to a church in Australia since basically I was born.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:23.680]   And then, but my mum and dad both like growing up in Australia and in, and in Switzerland,
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.440]   they were kind of around church, but they weren't necessarily from like Christian families
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.440]   themselves.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.840]   So they're kind of both first generation as well.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.240]   And then, yeah, so that's my spiritual heritage.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   Oh, thank you.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   Thank you.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   And is this so Julian, what about yourself?
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.760]   In terms of cultural heritage, I come from an immigrant Chinese background.
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:52.120]   So Malaysian Chinese, and that can be traced back to my great grandfathers who immigrated
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.960]   from Southern China to Malaysia in search of a better life there.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.140]   And then my grandfather and my father were both born and raised in Malaysia.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.360]   And then my dad moved from Singapore here.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.600]   So I was born and raised here.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.960]   So that's my cultural heritage.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.680]   In terms of spiritual heritage, I can trace that back to my grandfather as well.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.700]   The church had a strong missionary presence in Malaysia at that time.
[00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:23.100]   So he came to faith through, I think it was the Assemblies of God actually, through what
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.940]   they were doing there in Malaysia.
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:32.300]   And then my dad also came to faith as a young teenage boy through the Brethren Church.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.700]   So I can trace my spiritual heritage back just three generations as well.
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.700]   Oh, interesting.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.900]   And of course, as I hear a story like that, I'm filled with appreciation for missionaries.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:48.220]   We see in the Book of Acts, all these apostles and missionaries who, facing persecution,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:53.540]   scattered, but didn't stop, didn't give up, didn't hide, didn't try and conform to the
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.860]   patterns of this world.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.220]   But they couldn't help themselves but share the gospel.
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:02.780]   And I feel as though all of us are beneficiaries of these spiritual giants, some we know of,
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:08.260]   some we don't know of, who actually, if it were not for them being so committed to spreading
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.420]   the gospel, we may not even be here as children of God.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:17.420]   I think that just fills me with praise for how God uses people to work.
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.420]   Absolutely.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.420]   Absolutely.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:20.420]   Christina, what about you?
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.420]   Where did your family come from?
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:33.420]   Well, I only just discovered that both my parents' grandparents came from Bao'an.
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:39.420]   Bao'an is a province in Guangdong.
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.420]   Guangdong, yeah.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:49.820]   And my grandparents moved to Hong Kong in search for a better life.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:57.660]   And then my parents, so my dad grew up in Genting and my mom grew up in a place called
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.660]   Lei Ji Wo.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:04.180]   Yeah, it's a little island.
[00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:12.020]   And they both moved to the UK in their teen years.
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:17.300]   And then funnily enough, I came back.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.760]   Very quickly then, I wanted to ask just maybe just the first thing that pops to mind.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.760]   What is it about the Chinese?
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.220]   Let me rephrase this.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.100]   Where do you see God in the Chinese culture from your angle?
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.500]   Where do you see God in the Chinese culture?
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.340]   I think I see God in how in the Chinese culture, there are also very specific roles for the
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.540]   family and there's also just like a sense of duty to the family.
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:46.420]   And in my family, my mom's side is a very traditional Chinese culture.
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.540]   So then they really valued a lot of that.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:53.500]   And also just in the value of family, which is a huge thing in the Chinese culture.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.620]   You want to gather for all the "Tunin Fa" and all the winter solstice.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.140]   It's just the thing.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:05.380]   And all these are just values that God has as well for us to be family and treasure all
[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.380]   that.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.060]   Are there any downsides to actually to some of those features?
[00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:14.340]   Would you say that actually it is a godly thing, but has ended up maybe not being so
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.340]   godly?
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.340]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.340]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:23.340]   And I can see that just in the very traditional areas of the heritage from my mom, where in
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:28.460]   the duty, there was a lot of just a lot of shame when you couldn't achieve that kind
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:33.260]   of duty or a sense of feeling that you have to be able to do certain things in order to
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.300]   get a reward or to in order to feel loved, where it's pushed to the extreme where we
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:42.500]   don't recognize the drive of just doing that thing will be for love or where even though
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:48.100]   there are roles in the family where the women would be supporting the men in their work
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.180]   that went very far on that spectrum of patriarchy where the women didn't have opportunities
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:23:00.260]   to study to be a part of just to take on more of the things and they could where, yeah,
[00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.340]   where in Christ where the love would redeem that.
[00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.340]   That's great to hear.
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.900]   And Paul, what about you as a, as someone who's kind of learning about the culture?
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.900]   What is it?
[00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:14.260]   What is it about the culture that you where you see God is clearly working?
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:20.100]   One thing that comes across strongly to me, and I think especially at KFCI is just humble
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:26.980]   service that comes across a lot, whether it's like from people my own age, but also some
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:32.740]   of the most successful people I've ever met are willing to just serve in ways that are
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.820]   in their, in their line of expertise and also not as well.
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:41.020]   So I think that that takes real humility and willingness.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:47.980]   And one other thing I'd say is also just the high value on sort of education.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.740]   It means that people when they really, they really want to know about what they believe
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.700]   in so that that desire to really understand the scripture, understand what, what it is
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:03.460]   they believe is, is I think really a lot more, a lot more prevalent than in maybe some other
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.460]   cultures.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.460]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.340]   And yeah, I think there is this, there's maybe built into our cultures and maybe the way
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:16.940]   we were raised is this thirst for knowledge, this thirst for being taught to fill, to fill
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:19.420]   our minds with, with good stuff.
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:20.420]   And actually that is good.
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:25.660]   But then of course, when it comes to our own kind of humanity, there's always that risk
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.060]   where we, where we, where we yearn and thirst for knowledge.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.060]   And actually scripture talks about this, Psalm 27.
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.420]   You know, the one thing I ask for, one thing I seek is to, of course, be in his presence,
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:38.100]   gaze upon your beauty, but also inquire in his temple.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.140]   I think that's such a good thing to have.
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.980]   But maybe the things that we neglect are the being in his presence, the gazing upon his
[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:45.980]   beauty.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.340]   And those are the things that maybe we as a culture struggle with a little bit more.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.340]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:56.420]   And then here, what about you guys in terms of, as you, as you know, the Chinese culture
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:03.260]   well, are there some things where you think, you know, I really wish God would be bigger
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.860]   in this dynamic, in this setting.
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.340]   Is there anything that really pops out to you guys?
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.780]   How can, how can God really redeem us from certain parts of the culture?
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.340]   Well, this is me just thinking off the top of my head, bouncing off what are you guys
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.900]   think, but yeah, we, we know how to grind.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.540]   We have a great work ethic, right?
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:26.540]   So you know, I, for one, am the benefactor of so much hard work that, you know, my father
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:32.940]   put in, my grandfather put in, and, you know, forging a life and a household in Malaysia.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:38.100]   So there's, there's that, there's that strength of our culture that again, has that dark side
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:43.700]   that I think you just alluded to James, where we, and I think maybe in some ways I've inherited
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:49.820]   this, we have a trouble with sitting still and just appreciating what's good around us,
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.820]   being present.
[00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:55.420]   And there is just that constant instinct to just keep working, keep working, keep working,
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.420]   like what's next?
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.420]   What's next?
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.420]   You know, how can we provide for others?
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.740]   But you know, there's a, there's, I think there's a real sense in which the Lord wants
[00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:09.940]   us to enjoy Him and to enjoy what He, what He's placed around us as well.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.940]   That just, just that ability to be still and to, you know, to take a step back.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:15.940]   Thank you.
[00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:17.940]   Something we've inherited for, for us in our culture.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.340]   That's really good insight there.
[00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.820]   And actually that ties in with, you know, maybe your experience, Christina.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.820]   I think, yeah.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:34.300]   I think growing up, culturally I've always been shown or taught to show respect and honor
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.620]   in your parents and to obey, right?
[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:44.540]   And I would say that that's probably translated into my faith where like, okay, this is Father
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.540]   God.
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:51.860]   How do I respect, honor and show obedience to God?
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:27:03.580]   And almost to the point where I idolize the doing of that and forfeit the, you know, the
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:12.180]   relational aspect of being with God and being at the foot of, you know, Jesus, you know,
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:22.140]   to learn about who He is and what He would actually like me to do in my life.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:29.380]   And I think that's, that's also reflected and tied into the way I relate to my, my dad
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.380]   as well.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:32.380]   You know, so it's, yeah.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:33.380]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:38.420]   And of course in this new year where it's the year of the ox, the ox known as the one
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:45.780]   that represents hard work, resilience, actually shout out to Andrew Garner at the Vine that
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.300]   John was part of as well.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:54.460]   Actually, he reminded us of the fact that actually Jesus or the way the scripture talks
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.100]   about the ox or the Jesus' yoke is easy.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.100]   It's not hard work.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.820]   And actually we can't get there ourselves.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.420]   We actually have to rely on Jesus.
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:09.220]   And maybe there's so much in our culture which is like, no, we can do this.
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.220]   We have to do this.
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.780]   And of course I can see the Aussie is.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.180]   Someone else can do it.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.180]   Someone else.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:20.180]   So the Aussies don't quite have that same kind of thinking.
[00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:21.180]   But we have that.
[00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:26.300]   But that is completely contradictory to what the gospel is saying, that we are saved by
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.940]   faith and faith alone.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.420]   And actually it's Jesus who does His work in us.
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:39.260]   And sometimes we try, we work so hard to be the one that pleases both man and God.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.860]   And actually that shouldn't be the way.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:46.340]   And so maybe we're talking here about when we're looking at ourselves as Chinese Christians,
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.180]   maybe that's where we've got it the wrong way around.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:53.220]   That actually we should be Christians who are Chinese.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:58.700]   Maybe what we're saying is actually our identity as children of God should be first and foremost.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:04.540]   And then it's the fact that we are then made in this culture is a secondary factor.
[00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:09.460]   And as we accept Jesus into our lives, as we recognise God as our Father, things should
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.460]   change for us.
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.780]   Julian, you had something that was interesting to share about that as well, right?
[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:14.780]   That's right.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:15.780]   That's right.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.820]   As I touched on, I have a more plural background with growing up here in Hong Kong, but my
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.820]   parents are from Malaysia.
[00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.460]   So I identify with the label third culture, Kay, which some of you might be familiar with,
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:32.820]   where you have a sense of both belonging to multiple cultures, but at the same time feeling
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:39.260]   a bit alienated from each one because you don't quite fit perfectly into one mould.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:43.220]   So that's a dynamic I've just been aware of throughout my life.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:48.380]   But I think as a result of that background, I particularly appreciate places in Scripture
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:53.460]   that talk about how the kingdom of Christ transcends cultures.
[00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:58.940]   So the passage I wanted to share with all of you tonight was from Revelation 7, which
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:04.700]   is the Apostle John's vision of the new creation and what that's going to be like when Christ
[00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:05.700]   comes again.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:12.060]   And so I'll just read from Revelation 7, verse 9, starting from verse 9.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:16.300]   After this I looked and behold, a great multitude that no one could number from every nation,
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.580]   from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:25.140]   Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud
[00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.380]   voice, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb."
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:37.940]   So as I was just reading that again, I'm struck by maybe the fact that, yeah, that picture
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:43.820]   of the kingdom resonates with me, how Christ came to save both Jew and Gentile.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:49.860]   He broke down the cultural hostilities between them then, and he's capable of breaking down
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.620]   those same barriers today.
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:31:00.460]   So I think I just appreciate that more as maybe, yeah, with my particular background
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.620]   and how my true identity, as you said, James, is as a citizen of heaven.
[00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:08.660]   That's how Paul would phrase it.
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.660]   That's where we're going.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.660]   That's where we're journeying towards.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:17.540]   Well, at the same time, just the final thought, just appreciating what you said about how
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:19.820]   we're Christians who are Chinese.
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:27.860]   So what I find really interesting about that passage is I just get a real sense that the
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:32.300]   gospel and Christ's kingdom transcends cultures, but it doesn't erase cultures.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:41.940]   You can see how those nations are still somewhat distinct in their features, and that all comes
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.220]   under Christ's kingdom.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:50.820]   So I think for me personally, that's meant that I've felt more happy to more recently
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:58.460]   to get to know my roots more, to improve my Cantonese, to work on that side and understand
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.460]   where I've come from.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:06.500]   And that's all good and well and part of the Christian life as well for me, I would say.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.500]   Guai jiang.
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.500]   Guai jiang.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:13.940]   Hey, just on that, before I wrap up, as I gave you guys a few days to just mull and
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:19.980]   think about this, for you to share with our church family here, were there any passages
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.220]   of scripture or words from God that really resonated in your heart or maybe you felt
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:28.980]   as though God was speaking to you about that really ties in with what we've just talked
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:34.100]   about in terms of what does God have to say about the way we live?
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.820]   Yeah, I have something to share.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.220]   And the passage is from Ephesians.
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.060]   For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:48.620]   It is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:54.500]   For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.500]   that we should walk in them.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   And just as I was reflecting on my entire family's journey throughout all of these generations,
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:08.300]   and just the redemption God has had on just a completely broken family where they wouldn't
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.700]   even talk together on my mother's side, to now, yesterday, just sitting together at the
[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:17.220]   dinner table, seeing gifts exchanged, to see that God's grace is able to redeem all of
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.900]   us.
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.220]   And it's not any of our doing.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.980]   It's the gift of God, not a result of our works.
[00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:28.940]   But also in this time to not forget beauty and also the duty that there is, and how there
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:34.660]   was a duty to the family, there was a duty to provide and to just do what they can for
[00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.100]   the family, much like our family of God.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.100]   And all of this is also just, yeah, we are God's workmanship created in Christ so that
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.460]   we can walk in them.
[00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:49.580]   So that there is that, yes, that there is a lot of grace for us and where we fall and
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:53.060]   where we are unable to just be there.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:58.540]   But God also calls us so that we can continue to walk in his work and he will supply us
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.660]   in his will and his kingdom.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.660]   Thank you.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.660]   Praise God.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.660]   Thank you for that.
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.660]   Christina, anything that really struck your heart?
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:16.180]   Yeah, I think it's very similar to the lines of Flora.
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:25.900]   I've been studying Ecclesiastes and it's very sad and it's like, "Oh, woe is me," and all
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.580]   that kind of stuff.
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:31.700]   But something struck me that was different this time.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.340]   Let me read it.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:41.020]   Ecclesiastes 5.18, it says, "Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:47.660]   and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.100]   days of his life that God has given him.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.620]   For this is his lot.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:59.300]   Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them and
[00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.180]   to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil.
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:09.220]   This is the gift of God, for he will not much remember the days of his life because God
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:14.300]   keeps him occupied with joy in his heart."
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:23.940]   And that has just, yeah, just warned me so much because as an ox, year of the ox, and
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.340]   I think a part of the environment.
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:33.620]   That means she's 24 years old, by the way.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:42.460]   I think cultural background and also family background, working hard is something that's
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.460]   a must.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.700]   That's so ingrained in me.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:54.260]   But here, actually, while Ecclesiastes is so much about vanity and things like that,
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.540]   everything is like chasing after the wind.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:02.700]   This is saying, "Hey, eat, drink, and be merry."
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:03.700]   Eat, drink, and be merry.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:10.180]   And yeah, I just want to encourage all of us to do that.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:16.340]   And whilst working hard is great, we should do that, but we should also enjoy the things
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.860]   that God has blessed us with.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:19.860]   Thank you.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.860]   And Paul?
[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:26.260]   Yeah, I mean, mine is almost more like an encouragement, actually.
[00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:31.300]   So to go back to what I was talking about before, which really stands out to me is that
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.300]   humble service.
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:36.500]   So Galatians 5, 13 stuck out to me.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:41.820]   "For you were called to freedom, brothers, and only do not use your freedom as an opportunity
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.300]   for the flesh, but through love serve one another."
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.900]   I have a translation that says, "Humbly serve one another."
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:56.900]   And over this as well, the thing that also stuck out to me in this, this passage is talking
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:07.100]   a lot about how that church was to actually help people to come and know God.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:15.620]   And actually that humble service and that love is really powerful and really, it moves
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:17.540]   a lot and it goes a long way.
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:23.540]   So that's my kind of encouragement, and to say that, that comes through and to continue
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.540]   on.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.540]   Thank you.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.540]   Thank you so much for that.
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:32.620]   Hey, and actually I've really cherished being able to just have here, you guys just bring
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:36.540]   something that God's placed on your heart and share what's been, he's been talking to
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.540]   you through his word.
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:42.180]   But I just wanted to wrap up here and maybe, I asked three questions at the beginning.
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.980]   I asked, where did we come from?
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:45.980]   Where are we right now?
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.660]   And where are we heading?
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.300]   Maybe I want to finish by turning those questions to you.
[00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:56.260]   And those questions, and I would love for you to ask yourself and really, and reflect
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.220]   on and then take before the Lord and ask him as well.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:03.260]   And those questions are the same, but maybe instead of we, we switch it around to have
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.260]   the word I.
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.500]   And maybe ask yourself, where did I come from?
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:14.500]   As you look back on your own life, as I did, as I went on that journey from Tien Tso Wai
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:20.300]   to Lao Tso San, as I walked, as I reflected on where I came from, as I sat beneath my
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:25.540]   grandparents' picture, recognizing the story that God has been writing on my life, my question
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.820]   to you is, where did you come from?
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:32.660]   Now, I'm not talking necessarily just about cultural heritage, but about your spiritual
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.540]   heritage or just your life in general.
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.300]   What has God been doing in your life?
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.140]   Because one of the great things about moving forward is also remembering that we need to
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.500]   look back to be grateful.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:47.140]   Gratefulness is so key, it's such a key theme in scripture.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.300]   It's such a key part of our own faith and our own maturity.
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:56.220]   As you look back, can you see God's hand in your life?
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:01.700]   Can you see the faithfulness that he's shown you, the goodness that he's poured out on
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.700]   you?
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:07.980]   And then from there, really the next question is, where are you right now?
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.740]   Where are you right now?
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:14.940]   When it comes to your faith, when it comes to how you as an individual, as a child of
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:18.620]   God, how do you interact with the culture around you?
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.620]   Are you more culture rather than Christian?
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.340]   Are you more Chinese rather than you are Christian?
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:32.140]   Or does your faith really come first and foremost at the top of your list in terms of priority?
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:37.780]   Recognizing that actually people will look at you differently if you are first and foremost
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:38.780]   Christian.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:42.020]   1 Peter 4, Gabriel preached on this.
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:49.340]   There are those who knew you from the past won't understand your new way of life, won't
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:54.580]   understand why you aren't joining them in doing the things that they do.
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:40:00.020]   But still recognizing that you have been ransomed, you have been rescued and redeemed from the
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.020]   things that are not of God.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:07.300]   But it's interesting, 1 Peter also says, even though we stand out from them, even though
[00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:13.540]   we don't do the things that they do, 1 Peter 2, verse 12, says this interesting passage,
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:18.380]   keep your conduct among the Gentiles honourable so that when they speak against you as evildoers,
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.420]   they may see your good deeds and glorify God.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:25.340]   So even though we may not do all the things that the world does, maybe there are traditions,
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.500]   maybe there are things that our families will be doing over this weekend, but maybe we don't
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.540]   want to do.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:36.380]   But Peter is also saying here, keep your conduct honourable.
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:40.540]   Be righteous, but don't be a jerk about it.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:45.180]   Follow Jesus, but don't stamp on the people around you either.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.980]   Keep your conduct honourable.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:52.260]   And maybe the final question is this, where are you heading?
[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.500]   Where are you heading?
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:41:00.700]   Considering your past, considering where you've come from, considering where you are right
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:06.060]   now, all the things that you're holding in balance, all the tensions that you are experiencing,
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:07.940]   where does God want you to head?
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.340]   Because often when we're asking God, where do you want us to go, where do you want us
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.340]   to go?
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:15.780]   It's helpful to look back, to see how far we've come, that actually we're not where
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.780]   we used to be.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:20.540]   Now we're not where we want to be, but we're definitely not where we used to be.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:25.780]   And it gives us encouragement, it gives us hope that God is still working in our lives,
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:31.180]   and gives us maybe a little bit of a hint as to what he is planning for us.
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:40.140]   Because we are all uniquely made to be in the unique family and work and education settings
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.340]   surrounded by the people that we're surrounded by.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:48.300]   God has a very clear and unique calling on all of our lives.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:53.380]   And it's up to us to really spend time with him to find that out.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:59.220]   And remembering, and finally, as you trace your steps, as you remember the unique place
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:04.100]   that you are in right now, and the unique place that God is calling you to.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:10.980]   That his call for us is not to redeem the culture, but to be redeemed from the culture.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.940]   To stand out, to be a blessing to those around us.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:20.220]   And recognising none of that is easy, because people look at you strange when you don't
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.540]   conform to the patterns of this world.
[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:30.460]   But also remembering that Jesus set us that example in how to step into a culture.
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.540]   And he stepped into the most powerful one, which maybe has lots of parallels with the
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.300]   ones that we've got right now.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:41.980]   He stepped into that, not to condemn it, but to save it.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.340]   Not to condemn it, but to save it.
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:50.860]   In fact, he sacrificed himself for that culture and ended up rescuing all of us.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.500]   He stood out and he was different.
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:57.180]   And he ended up giving up his life so we wouldn't have to.
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.220]   So we could live a life that is abundant.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:02.180]   So we could gain a true abundant life.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:07.180]   So this Chinese New Year, my encouragement to all of us is, as well as sharing blessings,
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:12.380]   is eat, drink, be merry.
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:13.580]   Don't spread COVID.
[00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:16.900]   Stay positive, test negative.
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:24.060]   Don't enjoy the blessings that God has given you, but remember to also stand for the things
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:28.900]   that Jesus stood for in the most honourable and loving way.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.020]   Because in him, we have a new father now.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:38.260]   And this father in heaven allows us, compels us to play by new rules.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:41.420]   And these rules give life.
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:42.420]   We are Chinese.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.620]   Most of us are Chinese.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:53.620]   But we are now first and foremost, children of God, citizens of heaven.
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.700]   May that be a blessing to all of you.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.980]   Let me end with a word of prayer before Paul leads us in a song of response.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:04.860]   Let's pray.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.780]   Father in heaven, we come before you.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.740]   As one day we all will, all tribes and all tongues.
[00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:16.780]   And recognising it doesn't matter what race we are, what culture we come from, but that
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:21.380]   we are all your children.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:28.780]   And you paid for us with a price, a large one.
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.820]   You died as a ransom for many.
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:33.300]   And now we are free.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:40.620]   Free not to conform to the patterns of this world, but to love this world.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:46.260]   So Lord, we pray that you will give us wisdom on how to navigate the challenges that we
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.180]   face living in a culture such as this.
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:54.460]   But may we appreciate and honour all the things that are of you that we find in this world
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.780]   around us.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:04.500]   And may we also in love stand for truth to those things that are not of you.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.740]   And as we end with this song, we remember that we are all your children.
[00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:09.740]   We are united.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:14.020]   Just as it says in Corinthians 12.
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:17.860]   That we are all of the same love and the same mind and the same spirit.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:22.660]   We are all part of the same body.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.620]   We are one.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:28.980]   And may the world see our unity and believe in you.
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:33.780]   And it's in your son's precious name that we pray.
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.320]   Amen.
