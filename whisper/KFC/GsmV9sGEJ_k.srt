00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,860
 Thank you, Bonnie, for that scripture reading. I love all the energy as Bonnie was reading

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,480
 it. Good evening, everyone. It's great to be seeing you here online with us on Zoom

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,600
 or on YouTube. And so we've been going through this series of the seven I am's and we're

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,080
 looking into the Good Shepherd tonight. Now, Jesus makes a very direct statement that he

5
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,700
 is the Good Shepherd. And throughout this passage, he actually said that he would lay

6
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,920
 down his life for them for more than five times. Now, the verse right before that, the

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:54,480
 very first verse that we read was in 10. And he said that the thief comes only to steal

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,520
 and kill and destroy. I have come that they may have life and have it to the full. And

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,480
 we've also seen the other version where it says abundantly as well. Now, the word full

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:13,320
 and abundant, really, it doesn't mean this little bit, you know, sometimes we feel like

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,240
 our life is, you know, it's okay with Jesus a little bit, but there's a big chunk that

12
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:27,880
 sometimes it's not going that well. But the scripture says that Jesus came that our life

13
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:36,040
 may be full and abundant. My very first question to you is, is your life overflowing, full

14
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:44,400
 of life and abundance as much as it can be? Or is your life not quite fulfilling? Or wishing

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,400
 that you had more or maybe worse, you see no point of living or you don't even see the

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,160
 purpose in life. And like something's missing and problems somehow just seems to pile up

17
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:05,240
 one after another. Now, if that's the case, then maybe it might be that the thief has

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:14,840
 come into sneaking into your life, stealing your joy and peace, killing your self-esteem

19
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:23,840
 or hope or destroying the relationships in your life. So hence, unless we understand

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,200
 what Jesus is trying to reveal to us as the good shepherd and let him lead us, we're not

21
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:38,480
 going to be able to live a life that is fulfilling and abundant as he promised. And this fulfillment,

22
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,260
 I want to stress again, isn't getting like everything that we want, but it's a fulfillment

23
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:52,880
 that God has intended for us. So let us tonight understand what Jesus means and how, because

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,840
 he is the good shepherd, can lead us into this fulfilling life that he promised. Now

25
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,480
 in this passage, we see four characters, the thief or also known as the wolf, and there's

26
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,040
 the good shepherd, the hired shepherd, and then the sheep. Now the thief or the wolf

27
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:19,280
 is Satan, this world, the lust that we have and the false teaching that is just trying

28
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:26,640
 to devour us. And the good shepherd is Jesus who gives up his life for us, for his people.

29
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,160
 Now the hired shepherd are leaders that are not totally committed. And finally, the sheep

30
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:40,080
 represent men. And there are some in the sheep fold, meaning that those who believe in Jesus,

31
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,640
 and there are some that are outside who hasn't believed in Jesus yet. And Jesus is here saying

32
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,320
 that he will guard his sheep, his men against the evil one. So another question, this is

33
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,880
 a bit more interactive. How many people think if you're a Christian, the enemy will not

34
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,720
 come and get you? Can you raise up your hand? I mean, with my limited zoom, I think I can

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,120
 only see a few people. But I don't think anybody's hand is up as far as I'm scrolling around.

36
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,520
 And that is correct. I mean, just because you're a Christian, it does not mean that

37
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:23,520
 the enemy will not come at you. Actually, in fact, because you belong to Jesus in his

38
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,840
 pen, all the more the enemy will come and try to get you. He will climb the walls, and

39
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,880
 he will sneak up just when you least expect it. So all of us actually, Christians or not,

40
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:41,800
 are prone to the deception and temptation of Satan. The lust that we have in our hearts,

41
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,600
 the prideful thinking. And these things actually pull us away from living a full life. Now,

42
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,960
 for example, you might feel jealous or angry at your coworker, because he seems to just

43
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,520
 know how to please and flatter the boss without doing much work, and he gets promoted. While

44
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,720
 you do all the work, and you never get promoted. Or you feel resentful and hold grudges against

45
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,960
 someone who has wronged you. And you might feel anxious or discouraged, because you're

46
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,840
 still not dating yet or married yet, and you've wanted to for many years. Or you might be

47
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,640
 misunderstood or betrayed or hurt by someone that you love. Now, while the enemy at those

48
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:31,080
 times wants to climb through the walls, and to get you, he's trying to steal your joy,

49
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:40,560
 kill your faith, destroy your relationship, or even your life. But what does Jesus say?

50
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:48,520
 In verse 11, he says that, "I am the good shepherd." The good shepherd lays down his

51
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:55,420
 life for his sheep. Now, unlike the hired hands, he will not flee when trouble comes.

52
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:02,320
 He will not abandon his sheep. But instead, the good shepherd is here to stay, to protect,

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:08,840
 to care for his sheep, even at the expense of his own life. Now, Jesus laid himself down

54
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:14,120
 on the cross for us, so that our sins will no longer be counted for, and the wrath of

55
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,200
 God has been satisfied, and we're able to reconcile with God. And so he loves us to

56
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:29,320
 the point of death, and is pointing towards the cross, which he will go up for us. Now,

57
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:37,840
 what more will he withhold from us? And he meets us where we are. So this brings us to

58
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,320
 our first point, that the good shepherd protects us with his life when we're under attack.

59
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:52,860
 I mean, how is it that we can have this fulfilling life, abundant life, is to know that whenever,

60
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,600
 if we are ever under attack, Jesus is going to be right there, and he's going to crush

61
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,160
 your enemies. And so when Jesus says he's the good shepherd, he meant what he said.

62
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:12,040
 And when we're being eyed by the wolf, our enemy just wants to snatch us. When the enemy

63
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:19,760
 wants to fill our hearts with hatred, anger, frustration, hopelessness, greed, selfishness,

64
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:26,280
 pride, and rather it's like, in our study, if you're still studying, or at our job, with

65
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:36,120
 our relationships or our health, do we run to him as a refuge and savior? And if we do,

66
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,840
 we can have this abundant life. And I remember when I was young and younger, sorry, I'm still

67
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,840
 young. But I remember when I was younger, and my sisters would give me a hard time every

68
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:53,040
 now and then, I would always cry and go to my mom or dad. And I remember my dad, he would

69
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,960
 always ask me, did anyone bully you today? I should have feel so safe when he asked me

70
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,360
 that. Because if my sister did, oh, for sure, they're going to get it real bad for my dad.

71
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,240
 And as we grew up, of course, we should grow and become independent. But spiritually, we

72
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,520
 are never independent. Because we are struggling against, not with the flesh and blood, as

73
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,920
 Ephesians 6.12 tells us, but we are against the authorities, against the powers of this

74
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:33,520
 dark world, and against the spiritual forces of the evil in the heavenly realm. So we must

75
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:42,880
 fight against the spiritual realm by depending on God. And so if we want to live this fulfilling,

76
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:51,200
 abundant life, we must remember that the spiritual warfare belongs to God. And so when Jesus

77
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,520
 says that he is the Good Shepherd, and he lays down his life for us, unlike the hired

78
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:05,520
 worker, a few things he mentions, number one is that it's because we belong to him. Jesus

79
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:13,280
 owns us, our lives belong to him. Belong means that he's our master. He's ultimately responsible

80
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:21,440
 for us. I mean, have you ever seen a cub who's under attack? Oh, the mother lioness fiercely

81
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,400
 pounds on any predator and will fight to her last breath for the cub. Why? Because the

82
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,080
 cubs belong to her. Now in the same way, when we're being eyed by the enemy, and he wants

83
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,680
 to touch us, Jesus will not stand there. He's not going to flee. He will get the enemy for

84
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,640
 us. And he will rescue us and fight for us. And he will not abandon us, nor forsake us,

85
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:56,320
 because not only was it an order from God, but we belong to him. And most of all, he

86
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,400
 cares about us. And that's why he's going to protect us. Now, some of you who have children

87
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:09,840
 or are married, when your child or spouse is in need, you will go to them right away.

88
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,720
 Or on the flip side, if you're still living with your parents, you know that whenever

89
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,400
 you need help and you shout out for them, they will come for you. And so the first thing

90
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:30,960
 in order for us to live this abundant life is to know that whenever our joy is being stolen,

91
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,040
 or we're under attack by the enemy, we no longer need to live for ourselves. But we

92
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,600
 can go to the Father, and he is going to get the enemy back. And he will restore the joy

93
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,560
 and the peace and love and all the fruits of the spirit that Jesus had intended for you.

94
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:55,280
 So run to the Good Shepherd, tell tale the worst of the enemy to the Good Shepherd,

95
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:02,000
 and he will fight for you. Remember, your enemy is not the person or the situation that

96
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,320
 you're in. It's the evil works of the devil, the sins within us, the selfishness or the

97
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,200
 pride. So ask God to help you to fight and to restore that. Whatever it is, don't fight

98
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,240
 it yourself. Give it to the Good Shepherd, and he will fight for you. And when you have

99
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,080
 trouble, turn to him. Of course, you can talk to a friend or have some distraction. I like

100
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:35,760
 to distract myself with some shopping or TV or self-help book and those are all good things,

101
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:44,720
 except they don't get to the spiritual warfare. So we must know who our enemy is, and we're

102
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,200
 fighting a spiritual warfare. And so go to God, he is our Good Shepherd, and he is our

103
00:11:51,200 --> 00:12:02,160
 answer. And as we read on in verse 14 and 15, Jesus says that I am the Good Shepherd.

104
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,200
 He says it again. I know my sheep and my sheep know me, just as the Father knows me and I

105
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,800
 know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep. Now this word "know" in Greek,

106
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,640
 in this context, it actually means a few things. To have knowledge in, to recognize,

107
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:30,240
 and to have a close acquaintance with. And so Jesus is describing here a relationship between

108
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,920
 him and the sheep, or man in this case. And it means that both sides have knowledge of each

109
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,680
 other. Both Jesus knows his people, and his people knows of Jesus. Rather it's the character,

110
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:53,360
 the personality, or the desires. And here also means to recognize, meaning that even if there

111
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:02,080
 are many people here, that you would always recognize that this is the voice of the Lord.

112
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:09,520
 Not that, not this, but that particular voice that belongs to the Lord. And to have close

113
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,800
 acquaintance is to have a relationship with them. Not just like I'll see you once a year,

114
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,920
 I mean we do have some of those friends. And if you have Facebook and you have over a thousand

115
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,080
 people, I mean those are not close acquaintances, but the people that you spend time with,

116
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:33,360
 people that you know, those ones you really know. So recently I've spent some time with some new

117
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,680
 friends, and we begin to share our hearts, our ups and downs, and we laugh together. I really

118
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,840
 feel that they're not just someone I know a little bit, but my close acquaintances. And we share life

119
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:52,800
 together. So to know someone is to have that person as your close acquaintance, involve them

120
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,880
 in your life, and you actually are involved in their lives too. So this brings us to our second

121
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,560
 point. That the way that we can live a fulfilled and abundant life is that we need to have a close

122
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,440
 and intimate relationship with Jesus, our Good Shepherd. Here Jesus is saying that He's the Good

123
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,920
 Shepherd. He knows His sheep, and His sheeps know Him, just as He knows the Father. Now that's a

124
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,240
 very intimate kind of knowing. And you know, for us ladies, you know, when we go to the bathroom

125
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,560
 together, I know this is an analogy that maybe the girls would get it more than the guys.

126
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,040
 Now when we go to the bathroom together, right, and I've done that before with my mom, and there's

127
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,920
 probably like 20 stalls in there. And you never quite know when you're finished or the other

128
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,640
 person's really done. I know the ladies are resounding a little bit more to this. And so

129
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,600
 what we usually do is we kind of say, "Hey, are you done?" You know, and you know, so there I was,

130
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,560
 I remember many times where I would just say, "Mommy," and then miraculously my mom would respond.

131
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,840
 And I must think there must have been like over 10 mothers in one of those, you know, not one of

132
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:07,680
 those, in 10 of those stalls, right? And how is it possible just with two syllables she's able to

133
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,160
 recognize me? Well, it's because we've been involved in each other's lives so much. And this is the kind

134
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,920
 of intimacy we're talking about. I mean, not one where we go to God every now and then when we have

135
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,320
 a problem or two, you know, not one where we read the Bible like once in the blue moon or like

136
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,360
 once a month or something like that. It's a kind of intimacy where we're spending life together.

137
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:41,360
 We're doing life together. And interestingly, in verse 15, he says that and he will lay down

138
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,520
 his life for his sheep. I mean, at first, I mean, he's talking about knowing his sheep and he's

139
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:56,960
 describing this relationship that he has with his father. And to add on this, he even points out

140
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:03,440
 that he will die and lay down his life for the sheep. I mean, how can you know someone to death?

141
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,320
 Is that what Jesus means here? Well, I don't think that's what he means. It means that you're so

142
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,920
 close with someone that you would even be willing to die for them if that's what they need. So it's

143
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,440
 describing a kind of relationship where it's so intimate that you begin to willingly give up

144
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,000
 yourself for the other person. And because Jesus is the good shepherd, he is so intimate with us

145
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,920
 that he's already willing to give up everything for us. Now, the question is, are we there yet

146
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:47,360
 in this relationship? And that's really a question for us to ponder on. And we know from the Bible

147
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:56,880
 that God knows us. But it's really a question of, do we know him that well? And are we his

148
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:05,360
 acquaintance or is he our acquaintance only? And so spending time with him and allowing him to be

149
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:13,600
 a part of our lives every day is the key to this fulfilling and abundant life. It's not about

150
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,280
 getting the things we want and solving the problems. That's not how we get an abundant life,

151
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:26,720
 but it's to have him with us all the time, sharing life with him. And if we do this,

152
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,880
 we will have an abundant life. And so for those of us, you know, who are feeling like we're missing

153
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,400
 something, we're not happy all the time. Well, we need this intimate relationship.

154
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:48,560
 Now, as we read on in verse 17 and 18, he says, "The reason my father loves me is that I lay down

155
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:56,320
 my life only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I

156
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,800
 have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from

157
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,440
 my father." Now, this is an interesting twist as Jesus has been talking about him and his sheep

158
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,720
 and how he is their good shepherd. Now, somehow he seems to redirect us and talk about the father.

159
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,120
 He talks about why the father loves him. Now, for those of us who might have grown up meeting

160
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,040
 the approval of our parents through our performances, it's easy to read into this

161
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:36,320
 verse and thinking, "Oh, Jesus was loved by God because of what he did." But the father does not

162
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:45,040
 love Jesus any more or any less because of any works or obedience from Jesus. And we know that

163
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:54,640
 because during Jesus' baptism, God said that, "You are my beloved son, whom I am well pleased."

164
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:02,720
 So, he didn't have to do anything to earn it. His identity was where it was all founded, this love.

165
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:10,000
 So, then what does this verse mean then? Because it does say, "The reason my father loves me is

166
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,280
 that I lay down my life." Well, this is an expression that God loves what Jesus has done for

167
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:23,600
 him. And the father is pleased with what he is doing, just like our parents loves us regardless.

168
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,040
 But when we cook a meal for them or get flowers for them, they love our thoughtfulness and our

169
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:39,040
 loving gesture. So, in a similar way, Jesus is willing to lay down his life, surrendering to God.

170
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:47,280
 In essence, Jesus is saying that he's willing to lay down his life for his sheep, whom God loves.

171
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:56,080
 He is doing something that the father likes and the father loves him in return. And it's actually

172
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:03,040
 speaking of this loving relationship between Jesus and God. And Jesus is willing to do all that,

173
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:10,240
 God tells him. He's willing to surrender. And what's so good about this good shepherd is that

174
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,080
 he's not just laying down his life, "Well, because God told me to, all right, I guess I'll have to

175
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:26,560
 lay down my life." No, but he makes the father's command, whatever is in God's heart, his very own.

176
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:33,840
 And he ends up genuinely loving his own sheep, because these are the sheep that the father loves.

177
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:42,160
 Jesus loved those that the father loves. And we have a Chinese saying, "Oi Wu Cap Wu," right?

178
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:49,760
 For those of you, okay, I'm going to explain that in a moment. It means that you love someone so much

179
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,240
 that you are going to love the people they love. You are also going to love the passion they love.

180
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,960
 So, this brings us to our third point. That in order to have a fulfilled life and an abundant

181
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,600
 life, we cannot be thinking about ourselves. We cannot be living for ourselves. Instead, we need

182
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:17,920
 to surrender to the father. This is the third key. And Jesus, the good shepherd, shows us that with

183
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:28,320
 his own submission to the father, he does what the father pleases. And he becomes the father's heart.

184
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:36,240
 He cares for the sheep. And this is a model that we need to follow as well. And the good shepherd

185
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:44,560
 is pointing us to the same direction. Because as the good shepherd not only understands the father,

186
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:53,520
 but becomes his father's heart, making it his own, so too, as his followers, we must do that

187
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:02,000
 in order to live out this abundant life. And so, the question to all of us is, do we surrender to

188
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,560
 the father? Do we take our father's heart and make it our own? Or are we still living for ourselves?

189
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:19,680
 Are we doing what the shepherd, the good shepherd, is showing us? I mean, when we're bogged down by

190
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:26,560
 our own situation, whether it's schoolwork, relationship, or kids, I mean, do we continue

191
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,360
 to still do what the father wants? Or are we so beaten up or absorbed that all we can think about,

192
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,960
 or all we are, is to be consumed by those situations? Now, recently, my life has been

193
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,960
 undergoing a lot of stress. And sometimes it seems impossible to solve it. And as the situations

194
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,240
 unfold, and I really contemplate about how is it that I can go on? How is it that I can solve

195
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,120
 the problems that are in front of us, in front of me? And I realize that I need to turn to the

196
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:12,080
 father and for Jesus, all the more for help. I mean, I'm just a human being as well. And I get

197
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,360
 anxious and worried and even depressed sometimes, just thinking about the situation. But I have

198
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:30,320
 been telling myself, I must run to the father. I must run to my good shepherd who cares about me.

199
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:38,000
 And I begin to set aside more time to fast, to pray, and to do devotionals for longer periods

200
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,200
 of time. Now, this is not a competition of time. But it's really a sense that I need him more than

201
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:53,280
 ever. Because I know that he protects me from my enemy. When my enemies try to devour me,

202
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:01,680
 I know that he cares and he protects. And when I run to him, I can feel the sense of safety and my

203
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:08,800
 joy begins to come back. I need not to hang on to my emotions, but to hang on to the truth

204
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:17,440
 that Jesus is my good shepherd and he will protect me, laying down his life. And even though I might

205
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,720
 talk to my friends and I speak to counselors, that when I wake up and I try to spend my first thoughts,

206
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:33,680
 I pray to God, telling him, God, I need you today. I depend on you. Please help me to continue today.

207
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:40,560
 Protect me against the evil one. And as I spend time journaling the things that I believe God is

208
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:49,600
 telling me and studying his words, I begin to know him more. And throughout the day, I mean, to be

209
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:56,720
 to be telling you the truth, I still get anxious. And I do end up, you know, maybe talking to some

210
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,440
 people about my issues. But I invite him to be with me, praying through the day. And sometimes

211
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,920
 it's so frequent that I can't even tell if it's my own thoughts or if I'm praying or a mix of both.

212
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:17,920
 But it's like I'm doing life with him. I'm inviting him to be with me. And I sense that

213
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:26,640
 my relationship with him continues to grow more intimately. He's my friend, my teacher, my guidance.

214
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,680
 And he calms me down. And because of this relationship with my good shepherd,

215
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:41,600
 I find strength to keep on going, even when I feel discouraged. And I believe that this is the

216
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,640
 kind of relationship that Jesus wants us to have. Having him as our friend, to be guided by him,

217
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,280
 to trust him with all our situations. And at times, you know, when I'm so absorbed with my

218
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:04,000
 own situation, I seem to hear still a voice that says from God, keep serving other people. And

219
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,080
 really, you know, I talk back to God and I say, really, I can still do that even when I feel like

220
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:18,000
 a mess? And he seems to be telling me, yes, yes, keep caring for those who are suffering, because

221
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,760
 I care about them too. And so I try to, with God's strength, to be obedient and I lay down my issue,

222
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,760
 maybe for an afternoon or an evening, and I minister to those others who are also suffering.

223
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:38,000
 And afterwards, I feel an immense sense of fulfillment. Those people also tell me that

224
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,200
 they feel better. And I believe that it's because God is helping me to surrender and to continue to

225
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:56,400
 do his will anytime. And that, my friends, I do know that are the keys to live an abundant life.

226
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,720
 Now, it's not that we won't have any more problems. That's not what the Bible verses says.

227
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:10,880
 But to have a fulfilled life, an abundant life, to live our life to its fullness,

228
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:18,240
 is to depend on Jesus, our Good Shepherd, who protects us, to build such an intimate relationship

229
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:26,000
 with him, that your heart and mind begins to merge with his. And then start to do things,

230
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,280
 not for ourselves anymore, even though our situations is very well present in our lives,

231
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:41,120
 but to press on to do the things that he wants, to surrender to him, so that we don't have to

232
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,640
 focus on the temporal, but to surrender ourselves to God and look into eternal.

233
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:59,040
 So, my friends, the Good Shepherd has shown us the way that we can and should run to the Father

234
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:06,960
 in our times of trouble, to build an intimate relationship with him, so much that we're bonded

235
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,000
 with him, to gain strength and to know his heart and to let his heart become ours,

236
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:23,680
 and to surrender ourselves in response, focusing on the eternal. And that, my friends,

237
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:31,520
 is a full and abundant life. And a lot of times, it's not easy for us to do that.

238
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:41,040
 But if we're willing to, I believe that the Good Shepherd is going to lead us to a place,

239
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:50,000
 to a kind of joy, peace, self-control, a kind of fulfillment that we never understood before.

240
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:57,760
 So, let us run to the Father. Let us run to the Good Shepherd. Rather you have burdens in your

241
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,720
 heart or heartbreaks, or rather you're just walking through your everyday life, have him,

242
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:14,800
 your Good Shepherd, leading you the whole time. You are not alone. Jesus, God, and the Spirit

243
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:24,000
 that he has given us is always with us. Let us pray together. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you

244
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,960
 for being our Good Shepherd, that in times of trouble, you will fight for us. You will not

245
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:39,600
 let the enemy touch us, because you love us, you care for us. And Father, we also pray that we'll

246
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,400
 continue to grow and have this intimate relationship with us. Mold us, change us, teach us,

247
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:54,080
 guide us, allow our hearts to be changed so that it will be more like yours. And allow our lives,

248
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:02,080
 Father, to always surrender, not doing what we want to do, but doing what you want to do,

249
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:12,080
 because eternal matters and the temporary will pass. Father, thank you so much for giving us

250
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:21,840
 Jesus, the Good Shepherd. It is good to be known and to be known. In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

251
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,200
 Amen.
