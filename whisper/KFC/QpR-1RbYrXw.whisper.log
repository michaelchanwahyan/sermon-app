[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Well, as you saw with the film,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.240]   today we are considering the parable of the prodigal son,
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.420]   perhaps the most beloved of all the parables
[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.740]   that Jesus told.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.060]   When I told a friend last week,
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.520]   I was preaching on the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.220]   He raised the question,
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.440]   who is the most stressed out in this parable?
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.040]   I thought the son, the father,
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.880]   or the older brother were in different ways,
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.640]   rather stressed, but I was wrong.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.840]   My friend said, the one who was most stressed out
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.360]   was the fatted calf.
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.720]   This story called the gospel within the gospel
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.960]   and the world's greatest short story
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.120]   is the climax of three stories of lost things.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.560]   A lost sheep, a lost coin,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.780]   and lastly, a lost son.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.480]   The sheep is lost,
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.400]   perhaps through careless wandering or inattention.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.760]   The coin is lost through no evident reason.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.440]   But the heartbreak of this story is the son who is lost
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.700]   through deliberate rebellious choice.
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.620]   Look at the heading in your Bible.
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.860]   It almost certainly highlights this lost prodigal son.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.260]   It usually entitled the lost son or the prodigal son.
[00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.280]   But make no mistake.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:19.100]   This story is primarily
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.580]   about a father.
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.700]   And it comes from the mouth of Jesus,
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.380]   a son who knew his father
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.060]   and he wanted lost people to know the father.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.460]   And this parable dramatises
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.460]   four characteristics of the father.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.300]   Let's read a few verses to kick off.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.280]   Verse 11.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.980]   And he said, there was a man who had two sons
[00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.340]   and the younger of them said to his father,
[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.620]   "Father, give me the share of the property
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.940]   that's coming to me."
[00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.240]   And he divided his property between them.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.260]   Not many days later,
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.660]   the younger son gathered all he had
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.700]   and took a journey into a far country.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.700]   And there he squandered his property in reckless living.
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.340]   And we see the first characteristic of the father is this.
[00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.780]   The father gives us freedom to choose.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.100]   The father allows the younger son to leave.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.420]   Sometimes the worst thing that God can do
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.540]   is to give us what we want.
[00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.280]   To show us that our desires cannot bring satisfaction.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:13.300]   The prodigal son got what he wanted.
[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.220]   But lost what he had.
[00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.100]   Can I say that again?
[00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.340]   The prodigal son got what he wanted,
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.980]   but lost what he had.
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.100]   When we rebel against God's will,
[00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.660]   he sometimes says to us,
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.840]   "Okay, you win.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.340]   Your will be done."
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.300]   Those of us who are parents,
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.220]   do you want your children to make good choices?
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.420]   Of course you do.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.900]   Do you say no when they ask for something foolish
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.020]   or dangerous?
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.220]   Of course you do.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.100]   An observation here,
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.260]   this is a lot easier when they're young.
[00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.820]   So much harder as children grow up.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.180]   As a parent, I'd often wonder what God was thinking of
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.620]   when he dreamed up the blueprint for teenagers.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.860]   But let's not go there.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:23.100]   The first characteristic of this father
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.140]   is he allows his children freedom to choose.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.500]   Whether the choices are wise or foolish,
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.140]   selfish or loving.
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.700]   Now the father's assets would not have been in cash.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.020]   He wouldn't have been in the first century equivalent
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.580]   of HSBC.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.820]   It would have been in land and livestock.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.100]   Charles, illiquid you would say, right?
[00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.980]   Illiquid.
[00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.860]   Deuteronomy 21, 17 tells us by Mosaic law,
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.980]   a younger son's portion was one third.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.900]   Thus his selfish demand would have required the father
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.660]   to liquidate a significant portion of all he owned.
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.820]   Notice the son's demand in verse 12.
[00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.780]   Give me a share of the property that is coming to me.
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.580]   Now, both the son and the father knew that his portion
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.940]   was to pass to him only when the father died.
[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:48.420]   He was in reality and in Hebrew culture saying,
[00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:54.260]   father, I now choose to regard you as though you're dead.
[00:06:54.260 --> 00:07:04.860]   That is the seriousness of what we're talking about here.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.860]   And yet, and yet the father freely gave of his possessions
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:18.820]   to the young son who had no assets of his own.
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:26.180]   Church, doesn't this remind you of the cries of our society?
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.780]   The voice of our age is the voice of entitlement.
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.580]   Oh, don't tell me what to do.
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.060]   I want to do what I wanna do.
[00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.140]   I deserve these things.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.060]   I'm owed these things.
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.380]   I depend on myself.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.460]   God, God tries to control me
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.600]   and just wants me to follow his rules.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.780]   It sounds just like the younger son, doesn't it?
[00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.060]   But think for a moment of the heavenly father
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.140]   who is pictured in this earthly story.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.220]   It is all his.
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.460]   He has made us.
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:22.020]   All we have comes from his gracious hand
[00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.780]   and his loving heart.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:30.140]   And yet as we so often selfishly demand our own rights,
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.020]   our desires and our wants,
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.940]   our heavenly father gives us the freedom
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.140]   to do as we want and choose as we will.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:48.980]   He allows us to spend our time, our assets,
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.740]   our skills and our gifts in the way that we choose.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:59.220]   His love gives us freedom.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.220]   Even if our freedom leads to loss and waste.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:11.340]   But it is our choice.
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.940]   And it is the freedom a loving father gives
[00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.540]   for he will have no slaves or puppets,
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:25.100]   whatever the cost to him or us.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.740]   The second characteristic of the father is this.
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.780]   The father suffers.
[00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:42.020]   Clearly in this story, the father grieves,
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.820]   grieves over his son's wrong decision.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:51.660]   This is the second characteristic I want us to understand
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.860]   about the father.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.220]   He is hurt by the son's choice.
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.540]   Imagine the loss of possessions, the loss of reputation
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.260]   and more than anything else,
[00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.500]   the loss of relationship with the son he loves.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:14.300]   He feels the pain of rejection.
[00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:22.060]   I don't care about a relationship with you.
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.540]   I only care about what I can get from you.
[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.460]   Shout the actions of the son.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:33.460]   But remind yourself again.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:41.060]   This story is first about the father.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:49.380]   And can I say many of us have a wrong image
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.540]   of God the father.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:58.460]   Perhaps dare I say, shaped by our own experience
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.220]   of our own human fathers.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.620]   Have you not met those who even if they do believe
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:12.620]   in God at all, imagine him to be cold, uncaring, uninvolved.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:17.940]   Is that how you see God the father?
[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.300]   Be honest.
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.740]   I need to tell you, that is a lie.
[00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.700]   That is a lie told by an enemy
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.380]   that wants to keep us in a far country,
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:40.740]   wasting our lives and trying to provide meekly
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.980]   for ourselves.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:49.140]   From Genesis to Revelation, we see a loving God.
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:57.300]   Grieving over the very ones who reject him.
[00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:03.260]   God grieves when his own rebellious people
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.980]   who had turned their backs on him, turn to other gods.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:09.460]   Look at these passages, I've put them on the screen.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.220]   Jesus in Matthew 23.
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.820]   Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.780]   and stones those who are sent it.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.300]   How often would I have gathered your children together
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:29.300]   as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings?
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.540]   And you would not.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.140]   Or God the father in the Old Testament
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.100]   in the book of Hosea chapter 11.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.700]   He says, "Oh, how can I give you up Israel?
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.100]   How can I let you go?
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.100]   My heart is torn within me and my compassion overflows."
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:57.380]   I'm sure that some of you here today are thinking,
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.300]   I know exactly how that father feels.
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.980]   I have a child, I have a loved one
[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.460]   who has also gone to a far country.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.140]   She is also distant from me.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:14.020]   He's wasting the precious things he's been given.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.780]   She's throwing away her life.
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:18.780]   He thinks he's really living, but he's really dying.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:26.260]   You need to know that God the father agrees
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:28.980]   for those who are like the lost son
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.540]   also has a compassion for your pain too.
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:37.140]   More than you can know.
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.940]   Could you be a better parent?
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:41.700]   Yeah, of course.
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.140]   But even the perfect father himself
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.940]   had children who turned their backs on him
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.660]   and chose what they wanted over relationship
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:51.940]   with a loving father.
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:55.940]   But note in the parable,
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:01.860]   the father suffered, but the son also suffers.
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.700]   There are two sons in this parable.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.820]   So consider with me for a moment, this younger son.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.420]   So vividly portrayed are the consequences
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.940]   of the supposed freedom he enjoys.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.860]   Let's read it.
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.580]   And when he spent everything,
[00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.180]   a severe famine arose in that country
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.140]   and he began to be in need.
[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.820]   So he went and hired himself out
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:33.860]   to one of the citizens of that country
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.420]   who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.340]   I'm just gonna pause there
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.780]   because how abhorrent would that be to a Jewish audience?
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.340]   A pig was unclean, right?
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:49.820]   And he was longing to be fed with the pods
[00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:54.820]   that the pigs ate and no one gave him anything.
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.340]   So the rebellious son suffers too.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:03.940]   The first days of freedom, hey, they were heady
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.140]   and glorious, full of white women and song as we say.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.100]   Only when he had wasted all
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.940]   do the consequences of his choice begin to bite.
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.580]   Only when he has spent everything,
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.940]   only when he spent everything he's been given
[00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.620]   is there a severe famine in that country.
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.220]   Only when he has wasted everything he has been given
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.060]   does he begin to be in need.
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:39.340]   He spent his father's resources without his father.
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.500]   Let me repeat that.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:50.100]   He spent his father's resources without his father.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:56.140]   And here's the truth we all need to know.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.900]   Whenever we try to use the resources and provisions
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:03.020]   of the father, independent of the father,
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.660]   we will always run out.
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.180]   Oh, it may be fine for a time.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:11.420]   Life is going well.
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.900]   Life is good.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.020]   But sooner or later a famine will arise
[00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.300]   and we will begin to be in need.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.740]   And like that young son in that far country,
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.340]   we try fruitlessly to provide for ourselves.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.380]   But we'll still be hungry
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:37.780]   because it is only in the father's house
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.780]   in relationship with the father that we will be satisfied.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.980]   I'm gonna say that again,
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.380]   'cause if you only remember one line
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.420]   from this sermon tonight, you need to remember this one.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.980]   It is only in the father's house
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:54.260]   in relationship with the father that we will be satisfied.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:59.780]   Third characteristic of the father
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.580]   is that the father waits.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.980]   The father gives freedom to choose.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.580]   The father hurts and grieves over his son.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.940]   And here is some good news at last.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.620]   The father is waiting.
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.740]   The father is waiting.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.580]   He hasn't locked the gate.
[00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:26.780]   He hasn't disowned this young scoundrel of a son
[00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.100]   who has brought sorrow and disgrace to the family.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.500]   The father is waiting for him.
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.340]   He's been standing on that porch every day
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:39.740]   since his son left just in case.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.940]   How do we know that?
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.860]   Let's read it.
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:48.260]   But when he, the prodigal came to himself, he said,
[00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.980]   "How many of my father's hired servants
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.140]   have more than enough bread?
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.900]   But I perish here with hungry.
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.140]   I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him,
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.820]   'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.460]   I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.940]   Treat me as one of your hired servants.'
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.660]   And he arose and came to his father.
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:15.860]   But while he was a long way off,
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.860]   his father saw him and felt compassion.
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:27.140]   And he ran and embraced him.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.180]   And kissed him.
[00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:36.500]   The father was not only waiting,
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:42.380]   but he must have been eagerly looking for that son of his
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:46.380]   because he saw him when he was a long way off.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.620]   Think with me, how long does the father wait?
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:52.820]   It doesn't tell us by the way.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:54.020]   Is it days?
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.500]   Is it months?
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.380]   Is it years?
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:03.700]   How long does the father wait?
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:08.740]   He waits as long as it takes.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:16.140]   He waits as long as it takes.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.700]   He doesn't give up on the young son.
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.820]   He doesn't write him off.
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.060]   He waits until the lost son comes to himself.
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:34.540]   When the son comes to himself, he sees clearly.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.100]   He sees his father and himself.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.140]   He now understands the blessing
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.500]   and generosity of his father's household.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.100]   There's more than enough there for sons and servants.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:54.900]   And painfully, but honestly, he realises he is unworthy.
[00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:01.540]   He is unworthy of grace, unworthy of forgiveness,
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.700]   unworthy of relationship.
[00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.860]   All that should speak to our hearts.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:12.140]   We are as unworthy and dirty as that prodigal son.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.620]   We stink of the pig pen.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.540]   But Jesus took care of that with his life
[00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:21.660]   and death for us in our place.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.660]   And that is why we are children of praise
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.140]   and gratitude and thanksgiving.
[00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.420]   Look at this.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.060]   This is 1 John 3, 1.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.180]   I could have picked many verses for this.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.140]   Look at how great a love the father has given us
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.220]   that we should be called God's children.
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:44.380]   And we are.
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.580]   Romans 5, while we are utterly helpless,
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:54.660]   Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.900]   Now, most people would not be willing to die
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.980]   for an upright person,
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.180]   though someone might be perhaps willing to die
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.140]   for a person who's especially good.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.300]   But God showed his great love for us
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.300]   by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.
[00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.380]   Wow.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:21.660]   And what we see next is the lost son follows through.
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.980]   Now, before we look at the final characteristic
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:30.980]   of the father, consider something about this prodigal son
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.860]   who has shown himself quite worthless up to this point.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:40.780]   When he comes home at his lowest point,
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.780]   hungry and dirty and homeless with the pigs,
[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:50.660]   he realises he has believed lies
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.340]   about his life and his father.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:57.300]   He says to himself something like this,
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.100]   I will get up and get out of this mess.
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.260]   I've got myself into this mess.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.660]   I'm gonna go to my father
[00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.120]   and I will openly repent and humble myself.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.460]   That's my understanding of the words at any rate.
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.340]   And that's exactly what he does.
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:21.380]   Church, it's not enough to have a moment of insight.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:26.740]   It's not enough to realise how low you've sunk
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.540]   and how far you are from the father.
[00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.940]   It's not enough to realise you're miserable
[00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.660]   and hungry in the pig pen.
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.140]   It's not enough to spread a little cologne
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.260]   to cover the smell of the pig pen.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:47.300]   Over the years, many I have talked to and prayed for
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.680]   who said they were going to do this,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.220]   but have never followed through.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:59.420]   If this is you today, it is time to follow through.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:07.780]   It is time to get up and return to your waiting father
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:12.460]   and tell him I'm not worthy, but here I am,
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.300]   just as I am without one plea.
[00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:22.220]   And here's the best news of all.
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:26.320]   The father forgives.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.160]   This is the last characteristic I want you to see today.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.700]   Forthly, the father forgives.
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:37.860]   And the son says to him,
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:41.860]   "Father, I've sinned against heaven and before you.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.180]   I'm no longer worthy to be called your son."
[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.260]   But the father said to his servants,
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.940]   "Bring quickly the best robe and put it on him.
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:57.780]   Put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:00.380]   Bring the fattened calf and kill it
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.900]   and let's us eat and celebrate.
[00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.340]   For this my son was dead and is alive again,
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.020]   was lost and is found."
[00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.120]   And they began to celebrate.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.620]   Don't you just love that?
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.600]   The father doesn't ask for an inventory.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.940]   He doesn't twist any screws by talking on how much
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.780]   he himself has lost or suffered.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.540]   He doesn't even put the son on probation,
[00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:35.540]   which let's be honest,
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.220]   most of us think he deserves.
[00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:42.460]   He doesn't even take up the prodigal sincere offer
[00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.060]   of servitude in place of sonship.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:50.180]   Instead, he immediately forgives.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:52.060]   He immediately accepts.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:55.340]   He immediately restores relationship.
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.340]   And that's why the robe, the ring and the shoes,
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.740]   that's what they signify.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:04.080]   He immediately rejoices.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:10.080]   What a picture of our loving heavenly father who forgives.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.240]   He doesn't keep a record of our wrongs.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:21.920]   No inventory, no grudge, no probationary period.
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:27.160]   That's your father in heaven.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.520]   And aren't you glad?
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.000]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.840]   as your father.
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.000]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.840]   as your father.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.680]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.520]   as your father.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:42.120]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.960]   as your father.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.280]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.120]   as your father.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.200]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.040]   as your father.
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:47.960]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.800]   as your father.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.800]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.640]   as your father.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.480]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.320]   as your father.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.160]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:54.000]   as your father.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.840]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.680]   as your father.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation

[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.120]   as your father.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:04.940]   You're glad that you're not in the same situation
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:05.780]   as your father.

[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.780]   as your father.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:12.780]   As we close,
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:17.840]   I want you to take a little time
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:22.620]   to think of this simple, vivid story
[00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.900]   of an earthly father with two sons,
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.400]   giving freedom to choose, suffering, waiting, forgiving,
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.960]   and then think of God, your heavenly father.
[00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.960]   Do you know him in this way?
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:46.800]   Do you see him in this way?
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.780]   He wants you to.
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:58.940]   Jesus, the son, said, "This is what the father is like."
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:06.480]   Can we have the banner, please?
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.480]   (sighing)
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:21.040]   This is a time for your own personal response
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.040]   to what we've just said.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.520]   We're going to sing the song, Run to the Father.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.200]   If anyone wants to get up and run to the front,
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.280]   you're perfectly able to.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.700]   If you do, we'll pray for you.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.560]   But I want you, I'm not going to prescribe this.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.320]   I want you to respond to this in your own way.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:49.320]   We'll run to the father differently.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.860]   Some of you, while we're singing,
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.700]   you just might want to be quiet before him.
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.440]   Just spend that time with him.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.440]   That's fine.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.200]   Some of you, as we sing this song,
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.700]   may just want to picture,
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.600]   you know, we saw the reading on film.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.100]   Maybe you just want to picture
[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:14.620]   that son who was far away coming home.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.280]   And the father who'd been waiting every day,
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.780]   running after his son.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.560]   Welcome him back.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.940]   I don't want anyone to leave here tonight
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.180]   without knowing the love of the father.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.100]   (soft piano music)
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:42.400]   If you want somebody after the service
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.000]   to pray for you, to put their arms around you,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.460]   to pray the love of the father,
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.300]   we're here to do that.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:56.140]   But let's just stand for a moment.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.340]   Father, when we were a long way off,
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.500]   you called us.
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:13.320]   And you brought us home for your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:19.160]   Through the sacrificial death
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.240]   and the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.720]   we can call you father.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.640]   (soft piano music)
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:40.140]   I just want you to imagine now,
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.560]   you've come back.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:48.720]   The father's arms have gone around you.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.200]   The father is saying,
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:08.400]   George, Julian,
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.360]   Kelly,
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:18.840]   all I want you to know right now
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.680]   is that you're my son.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.980]   You're my daughter.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:26.760]   I love you.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:31.840]   And I'm so proud of you.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:36.600]   You know that, your heavenly father's so proud of you,
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.920]   each one of you.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:44.320]   And you say, but you don't know what I've done this week.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.480]   This thing and that thing.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:52.840]   And it's right to repent of sin, of course it is.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.620]   God the father looks at you.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.300]   All he sees is love.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.040]   Allow him now,
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.060]   just to put his arms around you
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:11.360]   and receive that love.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:16.120]   You are his beloved child.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:22.400]   In you he is well pleased.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.840]   (soft piano music)
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.520]   So let's sing run to the father.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.100]   (gentle music)
