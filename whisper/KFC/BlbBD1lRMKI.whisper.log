[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.600]   We're right in the middle of this series.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.900]   Don't let an enemy, don't let the enemy
[00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.800]   a seat at your table.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.200]   And last week, Pastor John did a great job
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.100]   of telling us that God has our back
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.600]   in the midst of different difficulties in our life.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.960]   God has our back.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.400]   In the midst of lies that attack our minds,
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.400]   God has our back.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:38.240]   A lot of times, there is a battle in our mind.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.200]   Who's been watching the Olympics nowadays?
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.840]   Who's been watching the Olympics?
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.440]   They say, well, actually, I don't know exactly
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.900]   what the stats are, but that physical part
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.480]   of doing the Olympic sport, it's probably maybe 70%.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.320]   You gotta prepare yourself, you gotta diet well,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.120]   you gotta train yourself, but 30%, or maybe more,
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.160]   it's a mental preparation.
[00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.560]   You gotta prepare yourself mentally.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.800]   It's the battle of the mind.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.840]   I remember one of the athletes, they said,
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.060]   how did you win the scoring goal?
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.920]   A reporter asked him, and he said,
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.460]   I envisioned it in my mind before I did it.
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.080]   The battle of the mind.
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.480]   I remember a student, his name was Jay.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.160]   And a lot of times, people call up,
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.620]   hey, Pastor Johnny, would you talk to my son
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.760]   or talk to my friend?
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.820]   He's going through something.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.020]   And so I talked with my friend, this friend's friend.
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.180]   His name was Jay, and I quickly learned
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.960]   that he was feeling a little bit depressed.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.780]   He had recently broken up with a girlfriend,
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.020]   and he's feeling really down.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.740]   And he couldn't eat.
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.360]   He was studying and he couldn't study.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.880]   He was in university, and he couldn't study.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.000]   And the thing is, he kept bumping into her at university,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.060]   and that made her even more depressed.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.200]   It got so bad to a point where he wanted to commit suicide
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.640]   just to get her attention.
[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.520]   And when I started understanding what he was going through,
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.280]   I quickly learned that this girl
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.540]   had become an idol in her life.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.760]   He had given the enemy a seat at the table of his mind.
[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.200]   It was as if Satan put him in a box
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.960]   and took all the air out,
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.280]   and he was suffocating in his mind.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.260]   We're gonna learn about four things today
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.720]   as we talk about the battle of the mind.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.840]   The first is Satan's tactics.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.120]   Number two, the spiral of sin.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.520]   Number three, Satan versus spirit.
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.440]   And number four, the solution to sin.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.780]   Let's read together as we look at Genesis 3,
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.040]   where it all started.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.240]   Let's read together, one, two, three.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.920]   Now the serpent was more crafty
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.580]   than any other beast in the field.
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.540]   And the Lord had made.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.100]   He said to the woman,
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.160]   "Did God actually say you shall not eat
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.500]   "from any tree in the garden?"
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.140]   And the woman said to the serpent,
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.660]   "You may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.680]   "But God said, you shall not eat of the fruit of the tree
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.960]   "that is in the midst of the garden,
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.220]   "neither shall you touch it lest you die."
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.300]   But the servant said to the woman,
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.980]   "You will surely not die.
[00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.640]   "For God knows that when you eat of it,
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.540]   "your eyes will be opened and you will be like God,
[00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.180]   "knowing good and evil."
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.080]   So we see here in this story,
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.520]   Satan's first tactic.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.800]   And his first tactic is to lure us in.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.240]   And these are my friends from Missaga in Toronto,
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.120]   and they came to visit.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.520]   I know he's a fisherman, right?
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.920]   He's a fisherman.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.360]   And what do you use as bait for a fisherman?
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.380]   What do you use?
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.000]   Worms or something really shiny and colorful.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And it makes the fish feel as if it's a free lunch, right?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.920]   Who likes free lunches?
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.360]   It depends who's paying, right?
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.760]   Depends who's paying, be careful.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.440]   You got lured in already.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.280]   Satan doesn't come in, knock on your door and say,
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.240]   "Hey, good afternoon.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.080]   "This is what I want to tempt you with.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.000]   "Number one, number two, number three, number four."
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.040]   He doesn't.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   He slides in through the side door when you're not looking.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:11.120]   He slips in some thought, some temptation in your heart.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.080]   And he lures and entices you just like fishing.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.040]   The fishermen never advertise the hook.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.580]   They only advertise the bait.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.540]   They only advertise the bait.
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.040]   And we see here in this first story,
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.800]   Satan questions Eve's thinking.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.460]   Did God really say you can't eat of it?
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.380]   Did God really say?
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:53.020]   And then he goes on to say, "Surely you won't die.
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.160]   "In fact, your eyes would be opened.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.000]   "Your eyes would be opened."
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.180]   And that's what happens with Satan.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.180]   He lures us in, makes it look as if there is no harm.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.020]   And we've already begun the spiral of sin.
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.020]   Sin usually starts with a cause.
[00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.460]   Maybe we are weak in the flesh.
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.820]   We have a certain desire for chocolate,
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.840]   a certain desire for junk food.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.820]   It could be other sins, a desire, a greed for money.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.080]   Hong Kong struggles with a lot of greed.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.520]   It could be lust, could be a number of things,
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.880]   the weakness of the flesh.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.560]   The cause could be boredom.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.840]   Just, you know, I'm bored, nothing to do.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.260]   And all of a sudden, Satan slips through the side door.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.360]   It could be something else.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.840]   It could be we're going through something.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.680]   Loneliness, depression, loss.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.960]   We need something to fill that void in our heart.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:16.400]   The cause occurs, and then the enemy is right there.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.880]   And he lures us in, and he says,
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.300]   "This will satisfy your need.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.380]   "Take a bite.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.840]   "You'll be happy."
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:33.960]   The enemy always knows what we are struggling with.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.080]   Are struggling with.
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:40.440]   We see the example of Jesus as well.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.500]   The devil gives a thought,
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.540]   and we have a choice to entertain or discard.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:55.120]   The devil said to Jesus, "If you are the son of God,
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.400]   "command these stones to become bread."
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.660]   Jesus was really hungry.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.260]   40 days, hunger.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.760]   And yet Jesus did not entertain the devil's thoughts.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.360]   The devil said, "I will give you all of this,
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.320]   "all of these things,
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.860]   "if you worship me."
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:30.620]   The lust of the eyes, window shopping.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.920]   We want what we see.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.000]   The devil was trying to tempt Jesus
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.200]   through the lust of the eyes.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.160]   And lastly, "If you are the son of God, throw yourself down."
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.240]   Jesus was challenging,
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.040]   the devil was challenging Jesus' authority
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.500]   and how he would go against God.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.920]   It starts in our thoughts,
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.500]   the battle of the mind.
[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.140]   And every time the devil said something,
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:13.560]   Jesus discarded what the devil said.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.320]   And in fact, what did he do?
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   He used scripture to counteract what the devil had done.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:27.820]   Our thoughts often lead towards actions.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.840]   If we're thinking about it,
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.960]   what are you guys thinking about now?
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.560]   What are you guys thinking about?
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.400]   Is it what you're gonna have for dinner?
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.800]   I just thought about it actually.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.440]   (laughing)
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.120]   If we're thinking about it, yeah,
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.800]   I see some people thinking about it, yeah.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.840]   Thinking about what restaurant,
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.400]   should I go on Eat A Go?
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.760]   Are there any deals out?
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.480]   What's open?
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.440]   What time is it?
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.000]   Will I make it in time?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.280]   And then you start to do the action, right?
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.960]   Hey, let's go, come on, let's go, let's go.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.280]   I'm hungry, I'm feeling this.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.160]   Are you feeling it?
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.200]   Our thoughts lead to action.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.000]   We start thinking about adultery
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.640]   and then we start thinking,
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.260]   oh, maybe adultery isn't so bad.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.500]   We're willing to conclude that adultery might help us.
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.240]   Adultery might be beneficial.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.200]   Adultery opens doors for us.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.840]   It's the solution to our marital problems.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.600]   All these are lies, every single one of them,
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.120]   the battle of the mind.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.920]   And why is sin so tempting for us?
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.640]   Why is sin so tempting for us?
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.320]   Because it feels, it feels good.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.360]   How long does it feel good for?
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.360]   Very temporary.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.760]   The feeling just lasts for a moment.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.440]   In Proverbs 14, it says,
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.760]   "There's a way of life that looks harmless enough,
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   but then look again, it leads straight to hell."
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.600]   It leads straight to hell.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.440]   Sinful pleasures are not lasting pleasures.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.880]   Sinful pleasures do not honor God.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.840]   Sinful pleasures don't provide peace or fulfillment.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:43.080]   They're good for a second and then it's gone.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.840]   Eve was eating this apple or this fruit.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:58.200]   And as soon as she felt that fruit go down her throat,
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.720]   she had committed sin against God.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.680]   And she quickly realized that she had committed sin
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.600]   and shame started to set in.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   We see in this spiral of sin, what happened with Eve.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:23.640]   She had a cause.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.240]   What do you think her cause was?
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:29.840]   Why did she, what do you think her cause was?
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.080]   I think maybe it would have been curiosity
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.840]   or maybe rebellion.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.960]   The thought of being curious or rebellion
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:43.880]   led Eve towards letting Satan talk to her.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.560]   And tempt her.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.960]   Did God really say this?
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:53.000]   And so she touched the fruit and she saw it was good.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   It looked good.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.280]   And so she went and ate of the fruit.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.680]   And it says in, let's read it actually.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.800]   "So when the woman saw the tree was good for fruit
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.480]   and that it was delightful to the eyes
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.960]   and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise,
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.200]   she took of its fruit and ate it.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.400]   And she also gave some to her husband who also ate it.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.720]   Then the eyes of both of them were opened
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.840]   and they knew that they were naked.
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.920]   And they sewed fig leaves together
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.800]   and made themselves lion's cloth."
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:39.520]   Satan's tactic number two is this.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.320]   First, he lures you in.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.960]   It looks good.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.640]   It feels good.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.400]   No one will be harmed.
[00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:55.200]   And then as soon as you eat of its fruit,
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:00.760]   as soon as you're tempted by sin and you sin,
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:03.600]   the enemy starts to condemn you.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.240]   Condemn you.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.560]   You're a failure.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.120]   You're hopeless.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.040]   You did wrong again.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.000]   God hates you.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.360]   You're useless.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.840]   You're an idiot.
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.760]   You're done.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.720]   God is angry with you.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:28.640]   The battle of the mind.
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:35.960]   I think the first time I remember God,
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.760]   this happening to me was,
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.760]   well, I shared this story before
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.280]   and I'll just quickly recap it.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.440]   I was shooting elastic bands when I was young.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.680]   You know, shooting people.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.640]   Who likes shooting elastic bands,
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.520]   threatening to shoot at people?
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.840]   Yeah, I like shooting.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.720]   And apparently I was really good at it when I was young.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.040]   And this newcomer kid who was probably like eight or 10
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:14:59.920]   or something like that,
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.360]   he came and we were shooting each other.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.680]   And apparently I had nothing on my face
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.680]   or arms or anything,
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:08.000]   but he had some red marks show up on his arms
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.240]   and maybe his face or something.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.680]   So I was really good at shooting.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.120]   Apparently, you know, my parents missed out.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.840]   They should have, you know,
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.440]   put me into Olympics for sharp shooting or something.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.520]   They should have known back then, you know.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.920]   But I got in so much trouble
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.200]   'cause this kid was new, right?
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.880]   And this kid was new and his sister brought him
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.680]   for the first time to church.
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.320]   And the pastor's son shoots the kid
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:42.080]   and there's red marks all over his face, right?
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.600]   And so how do you think I would feel?
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.560]   Well, I was probably crying.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.880]   I was like devastated.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.920]   I was like, "Oh no, this kid will never go to church again.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.400]   "It's all 'cause of me and he won't like God."
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.480]   And I was so sad.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.080]   And I was crying and my parents were, you know,
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.720]   kind of mad and angry.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.160]   And then what happened was this.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.000]   I felt I needed to hide
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.640]   'cause I was ashamed.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.920]   I'd done something wrong.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.520]   And my feeling was this,
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.600]   that I've done something so bad
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.920]   that my parents,
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.320]   my parents don't love me anymore.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.200]   My parents don't want me anymore.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.480]   I've not only destroyed my parents,
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.600]   but I've destroyed their reputation.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.160]   I've destroyed their church.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.880]   You see how it spirals?
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.440]   Me shooting this kid with elastic bands
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.880]   and having them red marks, I've destroyed my parents.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.000]   I've destroyed their church.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.040]   They can't be pastors anymore.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.680]   And it's because of me.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.440]   And I hid, I hid.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.520]   I hid maybe for half an hour or, you know, an hour.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.400]   And finally my parents called out.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.000]   They're like, "Johnny, where are you?
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.040]   "Johnny, where are you?"
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.120]   Just like, you know, God in the Garden of Eden.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.440]   And I came out and I pushed my dad.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   I pushed him.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.200]   I was like, "Les mûrs, you don't want me anymore."
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.560]   You imagine just like an eight-year-old kid,
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.400]   you know, pushing Pastor John, right?
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.920]   And my dad was like,
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:32.840]   "When did I ever say that I never wanted you?"
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:38.800]   And that moment, it exposed the lies
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.600]   that were happening in my head.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:46.840]   I had given the enemy a seat in the table of my mind.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.000]   And it was brewing, right?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.080]   From I've done something wrong
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.840]   to I've destroyed my parents' reputation
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.160]   to I've destroyed the church
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.400]   to my parents will never be pastors
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.680]   in this church ever again.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.360]   This kid will never come to church.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.560]   He'll never love Jesus.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.760]   He'll never go to heaven.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.960]   All these things were spiraling
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:16.080]   because I've let the enemy a seat at the table of my mind.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.200]   And that's what Satan does.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.520]   He condemns you.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.880]   You've done this wrong.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.320]   God doesn't like you.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.240]   You've done this wrong.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.440]   People hate you.
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.800]   He condemns.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.080]   And condemnation is out of what?
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.640]   Is done out of hatred.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.840]   But the spirit doesn't do this.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.280]   The spirit convicts.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.680]   And conviction comes out of a source of love.
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:06.040]   The spirit convicts us out of a source of love.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.720]   Louis Giglio says this,
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.840]   "Condemnation comes from guilt.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.600]   "Conviction is born out of grace.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.560]   "Condemnation leads you to conceal your sin.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.320]   "Conviction urges you to confess it.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.960]   "Condemnation results in remorse.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:30.560]   "Conviction calls you to repentance.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.760]   "Condemnation prompts you to rededicate.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.920]   "Conviction demands full surrender.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:44.520]   "Condemnation is a path to future failure.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.200]   "Conviction is a highway to real change."
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.600]   Real change.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.560]   When Jesus was about to go,
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.080]   he promised that the spirit would come.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.760]   And the spirit, when he comes,
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.080]   he will convict the world of its sin
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.760]   and of God's righteousness and his coming judgment.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.960]   God convicts us.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.880]   God disciplines the ones he loves.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:24.800]   That's the difference.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.600]   That's the difference.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.160]   Yes, we will feel guilty.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.200]   The Holy Spirit uses our guiltiness to sort of warn us,
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:40.080]   you know, like, this is, we're going down a bad way.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.040]   Don't go there.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.840]   We'll feel guilt.
[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.560]   But after we've done this bad thing,
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.960]   if we continue to feel guilty and beat ourselves up,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.000]   that's no longer from the spirit.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.800]   It's from the devil.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.600]   Beating us up in our mind, you're worthless.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.960]   You're not good enough.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.440]   God doesn't love you.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:09.560]   Instead, you should listen to the spirit.
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.400]   God wants us to change.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.680]   God is there for you.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.200]   He's got your back.
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:24.040]   Jesus has died for your sins.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.040]   There is hope.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.840]   That is the Holy Spirit talking.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.320]   Number four, the solution to sin.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.560]   The solution to sin.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.840]   How do we break this spiral of sin that we go through?
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.440]   Well, Louis says this, that we should firstly rededicate.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.600]   And he sort of says, well, rededication is good.
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.840]   You know, we just came from several camps,
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.600]   Explorer Camp, Young Life Camp.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.600]   And a lot of kids, you know, said, you know,
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.680]   I wanna dedicate my life to Jesus
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.320]   or rededicate myself to connect with Jesus.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.520]   And that's awesome.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.080]   But Louis says this, that the problem with rededication
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.600]   is that we keep having to do it.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:16.800]   And it becomes habitual sin.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.240]   We just keep falling over and over again.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.480]   We fall, we confess, we rededicate.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.800]   We fall, we confess, we rededicate.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.240]   And it comes this cycle.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.480]   And oftentimes, it feels hopeless.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.920]   Louis says, it feels as if it's hopeless.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.800]   Nothing's gonna change.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:47.240]   Something's wrong with us or the gospel.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.440]   It's not gonna work out.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.000]   God didn't change me.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.040]   Louis points out that this is the problem with rededicating.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.000]   We just keep rededicating.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.320]   We keep going through this cycle.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.160]   So how do we break this cycle?
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.640]   What is the solution to sin?
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:15.200]   The first thing we need to do is we need to confess.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.360]   And confess is agreeing with.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:21.040]   And in this case, we are agreeing with God
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.760]   that we've gone the wrong way.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:25.440]   As we go through this cycle of sin,
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.560]   we just need to confess.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.680]   You know, as the enemy is tempting us,
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.040]   we need to just confess it.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.160]   God, I have these thoughts.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.400]   I don't want 'em.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.760]   Please take 'em away.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.480]   I confess them to you now.
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.640]   In the midst of this temptation,
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.520]   you just gotta say, God, I'm in this temptation.
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.080]   I confess this to you.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.040]   Please help me in this situation now.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.040]   The first thing we need to do is confess.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.600]   And then the next thing is surrender.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.960]   Surrender comes when we raise our hands and say,
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.080]   God, I can't do anything about this situation.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.520]   But Jesus, you can.
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.000]   I'm not gonna hide anymore.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.080]   I'm gonna open up my heart to your love and your solutions
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:19.440]   and trust the restoration work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.920]   Surrender.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:29.120]   I think over all these years, I've learned.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.200]   I'm a person that is so determined sometimes.
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.960]   You know, when I put my mind to something,
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.960]   I wanna change it.
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.520]   I wanna do the best that I can, right?
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.720]   Whether it's competition in basketball
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.640]   or preparing for talks or something,
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.440]   I wanna do the best that I can.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.800]   And I'm also a positive person.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.400]   I'm a can-do attitude.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.960]   That's why I can do all these different sports
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.240]   and connect with kids and, you know, do all these things.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.560]   I believe I can do a lot of things.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.560]   But in the midst of doing a lot of things,
[00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:09.560]   trying a lot of things, accomplishing a lot of things,
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.280]   I've also realized there are things
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.320]   that I can't change about myself.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.440]   I have limitations.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.120]   As much as I put effort and mental energy
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:29.120]   towards defeating sin, there are things about us
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   that are so hard to change.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.480]   And we can't do it on our own strength.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.320]   'Cause if we could,
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.480]   we wouldn't need to rely on the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:45.800]   And Paul even said, he had how many thorns?
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.600]   He had these thorns in his side,
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.480]   and he begged the Lord to take it away from him.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.040]   And how did God respond?
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.440]   He said, "My grace is sufficient for you.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:08.880]   "My power is made perfect in weakness."
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.440]   Surrender.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.360]   As we surrender ourselves to the Lord
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.080]   in the midst of our sin,
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.400]   with things that we can't change about ourselves,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.960]   we are connecting with the Holy Spirit
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.000]   and trusting and surrendering to him.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:41.760]   The next slide is a cup.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:48.600]   And I put this cup in because
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.720]   it's either you fill yourself with good things
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:01.560]   or you fill yourself with bad things.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.880]   We are all filled by something.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.040]   We're all filled by something.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:15.120]   And Paul says this, Apostle Paul, not this Paul,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.160]   but I'm sure he'll say it too.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.200]   Whatever is good, whatever is beautiful,
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:24.200]   whatever is beautiful, amazing, good,
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.840]   think about these things.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.840]   Fill your heart, fill your mind with the goodness of God.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.000]   If you're filled with the goodness of God,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.280]   what room is there in this cup?
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.200]   What room is there in this cup
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.920]   for temptation and for Satan to come?
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.840]   And that is why it's so important
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:56.120]   to allow the word of God to cleanse your mind,
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.040]   to sanctify your mind on a daily basis.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:03.800]   'Cause we're so bombarded
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.200]   with our a thousand notifications a day,
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:12.520]   with advertisements everywhere,
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.960]   our friends talking, the news talking.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:25.200]   And it's all this junk filling our minds
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.400]   consciously or subconsciously.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.800]   And our cup is just so dirty.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.360]   What will we fill our cup with?
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.960]   Is it the goodness of God
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.760]   or is it the lies of the enemy?
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.840]   I'm talking about my friend Jay again.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:48.560]   So he's going through depression.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:52.000]   He had broken up with his girlfriend.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.120]   He even was like, I should just hurt myself
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.960]   so that I could get my girlfriend's attention.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.680]   And I remember just like a period of months,
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.080]   I would just be checking in on him every day.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:05.160]   I was like, hey, how are you doing?
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.960]   You doing well?
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.160]   Are you able to trust God more with your thoughts?
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:11.920]   Are you able to lay this down
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.400]   and give God, you know,
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.840]   let God fill this emptiness in your heart?
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.560]   And every day, I remember it was months.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:26.560]   And it seemed like we weren't going anywhere.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.240]   It seemed like it was hopeless.
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.760]   He wasn't changing.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.960]   He was still depressed.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.520]   He was still, you know, thinking about hurting himself.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.000]   And he kept seeing his girlfriend at university.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.840]   And it was just like,
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.400]   these things would go over in his mind
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.800]   over and over again.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   And then something happened.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:52.440]   He started reading the Bible on a daily basis.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.400]   And things started to change.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:30:01.280]   Instead of filling his glass with his own thoughts,
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.720]   with his own desires, with the desires of the flesh,
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.280]   he started to fill his cup with the word of God.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.440]   And he started to trust the Lord more and more.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.000]   And there was a period where I saw that change.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.480]   And he was no longer thinking about hurting himself.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.240]   He started thinking about the things of God.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.560]   Instead of thinking about who you're gonna call next
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.440]   on this phone,
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.920]   he started thinking about how God is calling him
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.760]   to do amazing things.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.800]   There was a perspective change as he filled his cup
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.800]   and surrendered his life to the Lord.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:52.160]   And now where is he?
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:58.320]   He's out connecting with people, telling them about Jesus.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.320]   He's promoting, you know, church events to people.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.520]   He surrendered to the Holy Spirit
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.280]   and being empowered by the Holy Spirit to do amazing things.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:16.320]   From a kid who was depressed, wanting to hurt himself,
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:19.320]   girlfriend was the idol to a person
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.320]   who had committed his life to Jesus.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:28.120]   And is now being empowered by the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.120]   In 1 Corinthians 10, verse 14, it says this,
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.200]   "No temptation has overtaken you
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:42.240]   "except what is common to mankind.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.480]   "God is faithful.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.800]   "He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:50.640]   "But when you are tempted,
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.640]   "he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it."
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:59.280]   This is the promise of God.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.080]   God, He will provide a way.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.960]   He's got your back.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.800]   Trust Him, surrender yourself to Him
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.560]   in the midst of temptation, in the midst of sin.
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.600]   Win the battle of the mind.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:21.560]   Don't let the enemy have a seat at your table.
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.560]   So confess, surrender.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.800]   The last thing is accountability.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   It says in James chapter five, verse 16,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:38.600]   "Therefore confess your sins to each other
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.400]   "and pray for each other that you may be healed."
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.200]   There's something powerful
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.720]   in confessing our sins to each other
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.000]   as we keep each other accountable.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.520]   Just like what Christina just said.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.240]   You're checking your scuba diving equipment.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.200]   When you're rock climbing,
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.600]   you're checking your harnesses and the knots and everything.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.960]   You're checking each other.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.120]   'Cause if you don't check it, something bad's gonna happen.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.480]   Accountability.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:16.280]   God created us to be in a community,
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.280]   to be in a family, to be in a fellowship,
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.680]   'cause we are stronger when we are together.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.360]   And we have accountability.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:33.720]   And that is the third solution to sin.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.480]   I'm gonna invite the band to come up.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   And we're gonna respond in a song.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.520]   And it's called "Lord, I Need You."
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.800]   And this applies to everybody in this room.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.480]   Whether we're going through a really big sin
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.080]   or just small sin or something we're struggling with,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.400]   we all need Jesus.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.840]   We need to surrender ourselves to Him,
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:08.400]   confess our sins, surrender ourselves to Him,
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.680]   and to know that He will give us a way out.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.480]   He has a solution, and He gave us the ultimate solution.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.520]   And that is Jesus Christ on the cross.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.120]   Let's pray together.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.920]   Heavenly Father, we confess that we have gone our own way.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:35.720]   We confess that we have sinned.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.320]   We have fallen short.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.760]   We have missed the mark.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.040]   And Lord, we wanna surrender ourselves to you.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.680]   And we ask that Lord,
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:53.600]   your Holy Spirit would be sanctifying us,
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.160]   making us more like you.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:35:01.560]   Bless us, Lord, as we surrender ourselves into your hands.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.360]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
