1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 - Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 And good morning to those who will be watching tomorrow morning.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 I'm just so thankful tonight that I get to share on the topic,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 "Take Every Thought Captive,"

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 and so that we can really align it with God's heart.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 It's one that's really big on my heart

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 because I believe that I've struggled so much with it

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 and yet because of God, I've overcame it.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 And sometimes I might fall into it again,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 but I know for certain that I have the tools because of Christ

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 that I can overcome it again.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 So let's start off.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 How many thoughts do you think we have in one day?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Anyone want to take a wild guess?

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 How many thoughts?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 A hundred.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Okay, anyone want to give more than a hundred?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 A hundred thousand, wow.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Okay, somewhere in between that range, okay,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 is actually 6,000 thoughts.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 We have 6,000 thoughts according to Queen's University,

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 their study shows.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Now, if we're awake for about a good 16 hours,

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 that would mean about 6.25 thoughts in one minute.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 So just within this one minute,

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 6.25 thoughts just flew by in your mind.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 So my other question to you is,

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 how many of you think you can actually control what you think?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Now, I'm going to take a poll again, okay?

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 We don't have a QR code for this,

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 let's do it the old-fashioned way.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 If you think you have control over your thoughts,

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 you can put up your hand like this.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 If you think you have control over your thoughts sometimes,

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 you can kind of go like this.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And if you think you don't,

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 just keep your hands on your lap, okay?

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 All right, one, two, three, show of hands.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 All right, we've got like one of this

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 and about a good handful of these.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 And some of those,

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I don't think you have control over your arms, right?

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 So just keeping it down there.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Yeah, so what we do find is,

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 do we or do we not have this ability?

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Now, according to the Bible,

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 actually the title kind of gives it away

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 'cause it says take every thought captive.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 So according to the Bible, we can,

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 we have the ability to,

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 but you are actually all correct

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 when you either put up your hand this way,

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 this way or this way

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 because our experiences tell us otherwise.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Sometimes it seems like we can

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 but sometimes it seems like we can't.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And maybe for some of us,

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 we've never even thought about what we thought of.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So all of those were correct

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 because those were your experiences

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 and yet the truth tells us

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 that we can indeed capture every thought

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 and make it obedient to Christ.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 So tonight we're gonna talk about

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 why we even bother to do that

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 and what does it really mean to capture

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 and then make it obedient to Christ

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 and how we're gonna do that.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 So just three things.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 And so the,

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 so the very first thing that we wanna look at

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 is a few verses, few, when I say few today

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 it will be a little bit longer, but stick with me.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 It will be from Numbers chapter 13 to 14.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Now, before that, I wanna give you

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 a little bit of a background on what happened, okay?

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Some of you may already heard this and know it,

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 but I do wanna say it for those

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 who might be here new or are not very familiar.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So in Exodus, we see that the Israelites

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 have been slaves for 400 years.

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And in Egypt, and so they're calling out to God,

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 "God, save us, we don't wanna be slaves anymore."

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And God hears their prayers and sends Moses

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 to help them by being their leader to lead them out.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Now, Pharaoh, do you think he would want these people to go?

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 No, okay, yeah, no, he doesn't.

88
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Why not?

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Because this is like cheap labor, right?

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Who wants cheap labor to go?

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 No one wants them to go.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So God then performs these 10 miraculous signs

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 or miraculous ways to save them.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Of course, it's miraculous to the Israelites,

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 but they're actually plagues to the Egyptians.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And so after 10 of them, Egypt's almost wiped out.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 And so Pharaoh says, "Oh, yes, please go.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 "We don't want you here anymore.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 "You're causing more trouble than good."

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 And so they leave, and of course,

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 the Egyptians change their mind, chase after them,

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 and we hear the famous story about how God parts the Red Sea

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 and they walk through it on dry ground.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And then as the Egyptians go through,

105
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 the waters come back, and then they all die.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 So we were thinking, all right, everything from now on

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 is gonna be smooth sailing, right?

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Not quite, because the Israelites are in the desert now,

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 and they're grumbling like, "Oh, there's no food, no water."

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 And so they travel to this promised land

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 in which God has promised to their forefathers, okay?

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 So, so far, I think some of you have heard these before.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And so we arrive to Numbers chapter 13 and 14,

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 where they have arrived at pretty much the border

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 of where the promised land would be.

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And so Moses sends out 12 spies,

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 and he decides that let's gather some information,

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 survey the land, so then we will know what's happening.

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 So after 40 days, these are the accounts,

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 and there were 10 spies, so he sends out 12.

121
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 10 of them said, "The people who live there are powerful,

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 "and the cities are fortified, very large.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 "We can't attack those people.

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 "They are stronger than we are.

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 "The land we explore devours those living in it.

126
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 "All the people we saw are a great size.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 "We seem like grasshoppers."

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 And so on the other hand, we still got two other spies,

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 the famous Caleb and also, what's the other one?

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Joshua.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 But Caleb says something first, and he says,

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 "We should go up and take possession of the land,

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 "for we can certainly do it."

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Now, having heard these two accounts,

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 now we have the rest of the Israelites,

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 which were about 2 million people, okay?

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 So they're listening to these accounts,

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 and this is what they say.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 "They grumbled against Moses and Aaron,

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 "and the whole assembly said to them,

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 "'If only we had died in Egypt or in this desert!

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 "'Why is the Lord bringing us to this land

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 "'only to let us fall by the sword?

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 "'Our wives and children would be taken as plunder.

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 "'Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?'

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 "And they said to each other,

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 "'We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt.'"

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 And then Joshua, hearing this, Joshua and Caleb says,

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 "Wait, wait, wait, wait!"

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And then they're like, they tore their clothes,

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 because that was a way for them to express

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 how deeply sorrowed they were.

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And then they said to the entire Israelite assembly,

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 "The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good."

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 So obviously very different than the other account.

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 And it says, "If the Lord is pleased with us,

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 "He will lead us into that land,

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 "a land flowing with milk and honey,

159
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 "and will give it to us.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 "Only do not rebel against the Lord

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 "and do not be afraid of the people of the land,

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 "because we will swallow them up,

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 "and their protection is gone.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 "But the Lord is with us.

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 "Do not be afraid of them."

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Now, after hearing this,

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 do you think the Israelites were pumped up?

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 Yeah, let's go take the land.

169
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 No, they weren't.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And instead, this is what happens.

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 But the whole assembly talked about stoning them.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Now having all this, you know, God's not dead, right?

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 He's not deaf either.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 He can hear everything.

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And so God appears to all of Israelites,

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 and then He tells Moses,

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 "I'm gonna destroy them."

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 And he's so disappointed.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And Moses pleaded with God, "Please forgive them."

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And God forgave them.

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 But nonetheless, God made up His mind

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 about what would be their outcome.

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And to the Israelite assemblies,

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 the whole of Israelites,

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 which was about two million people, He said,

186
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 "Not one of the man who disobeyed me

187
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 "and tested me 10 times."

188
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Now 10 times, not really an exact number,

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 but meaning many times here.

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 "Will ever see the land I promise

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 "on oath to their forefathers.

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 "No one who has treated me with contempt

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 "will ever see it.

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 "In this desert, your bodies will fall.

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 "Every one of you, 20 years old or more,

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 "who has grumbled against me.

197
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 "Your children will be shepherds here for 40 years,

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 "suffering for your unfaithfulness

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 "until the last of your bodies dies in the desert.

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 "For 40 years, you will suffer for your sins

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 "and know what it is like to have me against you.

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 "I will surely do these things

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 "to the whole wicked community

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 "which has banded together against me.

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 "In this desert, here they will die."

206
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 Now, I purposely didn't skip these verses

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 by just telling you the outcome

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 because I wanted you to see the words

209
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 that come out of the mouth of God

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 and how much that he detested it.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Now, to the 10 spies, remember the 10 that went,

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 this is his verdict.

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 "These men responsible for spreading the bad report

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 "about the land were struck down

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 "and died of plague before the Lord."

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 So these 10 died literally right there.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 Now, of course, a very favorable verdict

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 to Joshua and Caleb, God said,

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 "Because my servant Caleb has a different spirit

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 "and follows me wholeheartedly,

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 "I will bring him into the land he went to

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 "and his descendants will inherit it.

223
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 "Not one of the Israelites will enter the land I swore,

224
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 "except Caleb and Joshua."

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Actually, when you read this account,

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 I don't know about you, but I have a shivering feeling

227
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 because you see, God had intended

228
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 for every one of the Israelites

229
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 to enter into his promised land,

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 but not everyone made it.

231
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Only two out of how many?

232
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 Two million, okay, so this is a very, very odd,

233
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 this is very low percentage.

234
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 And what does that tell us?

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 You know, if we don't think right,

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 we're not going to live right.

237
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 And if we're not gonna live right,

238
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 we are not going to enter into God's plan for us.

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 And so this brings us to our first point.

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 Why do we need to take every thought captive to Christ?

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Because our thoughts determine our destiny.

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Now, sometimes we have this idea, you know,

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 oh, God has everything planned out, so you know what?

244
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 I'll just kind of wing my way through,

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 whatever I do doesn't matter,

246
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 because I will eventually get to whatever it is

247
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 that God wants me to have.

248
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 But according to this account, when we see it,

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 it doesn't seem to suggest this way.

250
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 This actually tells us that some people made it

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 into God's intended plan, and some people didn't.

252
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Now, I don't know about you,

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 but I definitely want to be one of those who made it

254
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 to the promised land, whatever it is that he has in store for me.

255
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 So this is why taking every thought captive is important.

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 So let's look at what it means to do that.

257
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 But notice in 2 Corinthians,

258
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 earlier when we looked at the verse, "Take captive,"

259
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 which in those days, if they had read it in Apostle Paul's time,

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 they would be thinking about war.

261
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 So when you take captive of someone, it means to imprison them,

262
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 meaning that person would not have any freedom,

263
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 they would not have a say in terms of what they could eat,

264
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 where they could go, what they would be able to do.

265
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 And that's what it means to take captive.

266
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Now, in a similar way, that's what we want to do with our thoughts.

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 But how does that work?

268
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 Because it's easier if it's a physical person.

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 I can just hold on to James.

270
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 Maybe not him, he's stronger.

271
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 I've got to find someone not as strong as me.

272
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Okay, maybe I'll go to the kids' room.

273
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 You know, hold on to him, right?

274
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 But what about our thoughts?

275
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 How do we do that?

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 And so this brings us to our second point,

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 that in order to take captive of every thought,

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 we first need to catch the wrong thoughts.

279
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 So we need to identify what the wrong thoughts are.

280
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 In order to capture it.

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Now, if we looked at the earlier account, right,

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 remember what the ten spies were like.

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 We'll look at what they said, right?

284
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 They said, "We can't attack them.

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 They're stronger than we are.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And the land that we exploit is devouring the people in it.

287
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 We're like grasshoppers."

288
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 I mean, what is it that you see about these people?

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Is that they're pessimists.

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 I might even call them extreme pessimists

291
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 because they over-exaggerate.

292
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Because imagine if that person had been like a grasshopper,

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 then their opponent would have to actually be like 15 stories high.

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 So obviously we don't see anybody that tall.

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 So what we see is this, if we have pessimist thoughts,

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 they're actually wrong thoughts that will lead us to wrong beliefs.

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 And I mean, sometimes we might think of it,

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 like everyday life, we have a lot of thoughts going on.

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And it might be that we might think, "This can't be done.

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 This is never going to work."

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Or if I'm a newcomer, or even if I'm an old comer,

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 I come in, no one says hi to me.

303
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 So I'm thinking, "You know what?

304
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 No one likes me."

305
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 And if it keeps going in a pessimistic direction,

306
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 "No one ever likes me.

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Why do I, I shouldn't even live on."

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 You know, so it's like a spiral of negativity that we go in.

309
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 So catch it.

310
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 That's the first wrong thought, first type of wrong thought.

311
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And the second one that we see is from the Israelite assemblies.

312
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 I mean, what do we see them like?

313
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 They said, "If only we had died in Egypt."

314
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 So they would rather die in Egypt than to try to get this land

315
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 that they're about to go in.

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 "Why does the Lord bring us here?

317
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 Wouldn't it be better for us if we're back in Egypt to be slaves?

318
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Why don't we just get another leader and let's go back?"

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 What kind of people are these?

320
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 Well, they're faithless and grumbling ones.

321
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 I don't know if you know any of them around,

322
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 but they're not fun to be with because they grumble about everything.

323
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 You know, you can do a very nice, you know,

324
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 you can finish, you know, a nice meal with 10 dishes,

325
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 and they might be the one that says, "Wait, this one doesn't have enough onions on it."

326
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Right?

327
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Or like if you--it might be something small,

328
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 like maybe if we miss the minibus or, you know, we're like,

329
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 "Oh, why did our neighbors come out at this--the same time

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 so I can't press the elevator fast enough to catch this bus?"

331
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 And they seem to like blame stuff on like just everyone.

332
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Okay?

333
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 And they grumble not against--not only against people,

334
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 but notice they also grumble against God.

335
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 "Why did God let this happen?

336
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Why did God let me meet that person?

337
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Why did he bring me to this job?

338
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Why did he give me this child?"

339
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 You know?

340
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Okay, hopefully none of you think that way.

341
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Not a parent yet, so I can't say much about that.

342
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 And so this is another kind of wrong thinking, grumbling.

343
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 Okay?

344
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And also faithless.

345
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Instead of what?

346
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 Bringing the issue that we have to God,

347
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 we actually bring the issue against God.

348
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 We're saying that--they're saying that God's against us the whole time.

349
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 So now that we know what the wrong thoughts are,

350
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 of course we turn to the right thought.

351
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And you know who they are, Caleb and Joshua.

352
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Now look at them.

353
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 They said, "We should go up, take possession of the land,

354
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 and we can certainly do it."

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 And they said, "The land is exceedingly good."

356
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 And this is a true account,

357
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 because those spies actually brought back some abundant fruits.

358
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 Okay?

359
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 So unlike the other account, which was untrue.

360
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And if the Lord--notice, I love how they put the Lord into the equation

361
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 in a positive way.

362
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 "If the Lord is pleased with us, he will lead us.

363
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 The Lord is with us.

364
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 Do not be afraid of them."

365
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And you know, when God gave his verdict about them,

366
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 I really liked how he said it.

367
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 He said they had a different spirit.

368
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 A different spirit.

369
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 And these people, you know, whenever they're faced with challenges,

370
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 they're able to bring it to God.

371
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 They say, "God will deliver us.

372
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 He will provide a way.

373
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 He's going to get us a solution.

374
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Somehow he's going to make us be able to go through it."

375
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And these are the people that if we happen to be on those wrong thoughts,

376
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 you know what?

377
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 Which means that we have a different spirit than they do,

378
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 sometimes we kind of want to stone them.

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Don't you?

380
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Because you might be like, "Oh, everything's so hard," you know?

381
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 And then they say all these positive things, and you're like,

382
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 "I can't stand you."

383
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 And that might be because we're in a different spirit,

384
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 which means that we have colliding thoughts.

385
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 But these people are the people that we need to learn from.

386
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 And, all right, so now you know why, because it will cause our destiny

387
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 if we don't take captive of our thoughts.

388
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And now that we know what we need to take captives of,

389
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 which are these wrong thoughts.

390
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 All right, so I know I'm doing these things,

391
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 but what am I going to do about them?

392
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 All right, this is where we continue on to see how we can bring them

393
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 obedient to Christ.

394
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 It really, you know, if I have to make you think of an image,

395
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 it's kind of like catching butterflies.

396
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Okay, I know, I don't know where you guys are now, but just go with me.

397
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 Catching butterflies, right?

398
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 So you caught it, what are you going to do with it?

399
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 You are going to put it in a confined space,

400
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 I mean, unless it was just for the fun of catching it,

401
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 but you're going to put it maybe in an aquarium,

402
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 somewhere where you're going to keep it in a confined area.

403
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 And this is exactly what we're going to do with our thought.

404
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Instead of letting it continue on,

405
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 remember the spiral of negativity or those grumbling, you know,

406
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 we can go on all day thinking those negative thoughts, right?

407
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 So when we capture it, we're going to confine it.

408
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 And the moment is like saying, wait a minute,

409
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 I don't think God wants me to think this thought.

410
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 I don't think it's even biblical.

411
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And that's the moment you've actually imagined with me.

412
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 That's the moment you actually caught it.

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Okay, so now you're going to put it into a spot, right?

414
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 That's God's word.

415
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 So we're going to go to our third point,

416
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 which is after you caught the wrong thoughts,

417
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 then focus your thoughts on God.

418
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Now, how do you do that?

419
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Well, by looping your thoughts with God's truth over and over,

420
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 then there's no easier way for me to put it

421
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 than to call it a godly brainwash.

422
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 I don't know if you've ever done that,

423
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 but it's a godly brainwash of truth.

424
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 Now, Louis Giglio likes to call it DJing your thoughts,

425
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 and I think both of them work.

426
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 And so what we can do is to open the Bible or to read it,

427
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 to listen to a sermon or to read a book full of biblical truth

428
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 where we then, instead of being influenced

429
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 and dwell in that negativity,

430
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 we are starting to influence those thoughts.

431
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 And we will then be putting it obedient to Christ.

432
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And so next time, when you're going through

433
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 and you caught that thought, you have to turn it to God.

434
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 And now I want to turn to Psalm 3

435
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 to give you kind of an example of how King David,

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 when he was being chased by his son,

437
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 now not to have fun,

438
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 his son wasn't chasing him to play tennis with him.

439
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 He was chasing him so he can take over his throne and to kill him.

440
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 He was in such a distressed moment.

441
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Maybe if we were grumbling, we would say,

442
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 "God, why did you ever let me have this son?"

443
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 or "Why did you even make me king?"

444
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Or if we're really negative, he might say,

445
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 "Why make me king so then I would die in my own son's hand?"

446
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 That would be a negative thought.

447
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 But in here, he does not.

448
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 And I want to share with you how he does it

449
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 by not brainwashing for him.

450
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 He's already taken it in, so it's part of him.

451
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And so I didn't put out verse 1 and 2,

452
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 but verse 1 and 2 said,

453
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 "Lord, how many are my foes?

454
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 How many rise up against me?

455
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 Many are even saying, 'God will not deliver me.'"

456
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 This is where it turns.

457
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 This is where he puts his thought in obedient to Christ.

458
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 He says, "But you, Lord, are a shield around me,

459
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 my glory, the one who lifts my head high.

460
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 I call out to the Lord and he answers me.

461
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 The Lord sustains me.

462
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 I will not fear, though tens of thousands assail me on every side.

463
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 Arise, Lord, deliver me, my God.

464
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
 Strike all my enemies on the jaw.

465
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 Break the teeth of the wicked."

466
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 See how he does not dwell on the negativity.

467
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 It's not that he doesn't have this problem, okay?

468
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 His son is still trying to kill him.

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 But he turns his thought to God and he says, "But you."

470
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 He doesn't look at the situation.

471
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 He turns to God for who he is, his character,

472
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 and how he has the ability to deliver him.

473
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 And that's what we need to do.

474
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 When we focus our thoughts on God,

475
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 we will please him and he will lead us into his plans

476
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 as he was pleased with Joshua and Caleb.

477
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Now I want to share a personal example with you.

478
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 As I shared, I think, some months ago,

479
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 that in the past I had broken up with an eligible bachelor

480
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 when I was around 29 years old.

481
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 And I got quite depressed and pessimistic

482
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 to the point where I thought to myself,

483
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 I'm never gonna find anybody to be with

484
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 that would love me and be as good to me.

485
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 And all the Christian guys that are leftover,

486
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 not leftover, sorry.

487
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 I mean, that are not taken.

488
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 (congregation laughing)

489
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 Obviously, these are lies, right?

490
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 You know that.

491
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 That are not taken.

492
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 Kind of not my type, you know.

493
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And so these negative thoughts would just come and come

494
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 and would cloud me to an extreme point

495
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 where I became just so hopeless.

496
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 I really remember looking out the window and thought,

497
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 you know, why bother?

498
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 There's nothing good left for me.

499
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 You see how that spiral can go down.

500
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 It was so sad.

501
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 But at the same time, I was like, but I'm a Christian.

502
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 If I commit suicide, not sure if I make it to heaven.

503
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 You know, you have that, it's a Christian struggle.

504
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 And knowing my faith, you know,

505
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 the little ounce that I still had,

506
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 I did not, but I prayed the prayer.

507
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 I'm not sure if some of you have ever prayed it,

508
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 which is, God, please take me home.

509
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 'Cause you can't do anything actively about it,

510
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 but you would pray that prayer

511
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 'cause you're in such a distressed moment.

512
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And so I still remember at that time,

513
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 I probably grumbled to God as well.

514
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 Like, why didn't things work out for me?

515
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 I've been a Christian for so many years.

516
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 You know, why don't you just make it smoother for me?

517
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Everybody else is smoother.

518
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 And so I would grumble against him.

519
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And I'm not saying that we can't have any emotions.

520
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Please don't feel like we can't even talk to God,

521
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 'cause that's not what I want you to take away.

522
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 But instead of grumbling, remember, add God.

523
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Bring your issue to God.

524
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 It's a very, very big difference.

525
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 And so I was so weak at that point.

526
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 Remember I said, oh, you can open your Bible to read

527
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 or things like that.

528
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 I wasn't even able to do that.

529
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 So what I did, I guess it's another promotion for YouTube, right?

530
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 We said the goodness of YouTube.

531
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Gotta have a song on that.

532
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Is that I landed on sermons by Joyce Meyer,

533
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 one of my favorite preachers.

534
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And she just had these motivative sermons

535
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 where she spoke the truth so well and so powerfully.

536
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 It helped me.

537
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 She told me that God loves you.

538
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 God has a plan for you.

539
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And your story's not over yet.

540
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 And there's more to come.

541
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And God's powerful to say,

542
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 you're the head and not the tail, above and not beneath.

543
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 And even though those scriptures,

544
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 they're truly scriptures, but she spoke them out.

545
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And that was when it gave me power.

546
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 It was almost like, not almost,

547
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 it was the moment when I captured those thoughts

548
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 and it was in obedience with God.

549
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 And I had this surge.

550
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 I'm like, oh, yes, I can do it.

551
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 And guess how long it lasted.

552
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 (audience laughing)

553
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 One hour.

554
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 (audience laughing)

555
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 And all those wrong thoughts came back and I'm like,

556
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 oh, I'm never gonna make it.

557
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 And then I'll be like, okay,

558
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 let's press the sermon again.

559
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 And oh, I'm charged.

560
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 So I'm like, it's just like a rollercoaster ride

561
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 where I'm like, oh, I'm dying.

562
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 Oh, I'm charged, I'm dying, I'm charged.

563
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And to a point where I'm like, oh my gosh,

564
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I think I'm just gonna,

565
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 my head's just gonna explode or something.

566
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 But there was, you know,

567
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 the frequency then began slowly to increase.

568
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 So instead of one hour apart, you know,

569
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 slowly it was two hours apart

570
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 before I needed an extra dose of God's truth, right?

571
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 And then before I know it, it's three hours, four hours,

572
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 half a day, one day, one week, a week and a half.

573
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And maybe I fall back to two days and, you know,

574
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 it bounced back and forth.

575
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 And eventually one month, two months, a year.

576
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 And now I just listened to it to get more knowledge,

577
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 not for the boost.

578
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 And what do I wanna say?

579
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Well, you see, I could have died in that moment.

580
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 Not that I, I don't think I actually would have,

581
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 but what more was, I could have withered away,

582
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 which meant that I can just continue to live on

583
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 being a weakless Christian going like,

584
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 oh, my days, oh, let's go to work, you know.

585
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I could have continued the rest of my life like that,

586
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 couldn't I?

587
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 But because of God's grace and how he taught me,

588
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 take captive of those thoughts, the wrong ones,

589
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 make them obedient to Christ.

590
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 And he used that method to help me.

591
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 And for you, it can be other things.

592
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 It doesn't have to be that.

593
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 It can be like listening to KFCI sermons

594
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 over and over again, right?

595
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 And whatever it may be,

596
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 we need to make it obedient to Christ.

597
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 And when we do, I mean, my life has turned around

598
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 and I believe just like in Numbers chapter 13 and 14,

599
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 yours will too, yours will too.

600
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And really, I believe I walked into God's plan.

601
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 I mean, I'm standing here today,

602
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 which I don't think I could have

603
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 if I continued with those negative thoughts,

604
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 with those grumbling and faithless thoughts.

605
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 But when we begin to think right,

606
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 do you know what's the most important thing?

607
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 Is that we please our God.

608
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 That's what it said.

609
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Remember what Joshua and Caleb said?

610
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 If God is pleased with us,

611
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 he will lead us into that land.

612
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And I wanna say with your faithful thoughts,

613
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 if you make it obedient to Christ,

614
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 following him in terms of just

615
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 repeatedly thinking about his goodness,

616
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 thinking about how he's gonna deliver you,

617
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 slowly let that become your belief

618
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 that pleases God.

619
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 And I don't know, when you please God,

620
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 I don't know where he's gonna take you,

621
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 but it's gonna be far, it's gonna be good.

622
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 It's gonna be that land flowing with milk and honey.

623
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 And I wanna be there and I want all of us to be there.

624
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 All of us, not two out of 2 million,

625
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 but all of us.

626
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 And so my friends, I don't know what issues

627
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 you're facing right now or maybe in the future.

628
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Is it getting through exams and thinking,

629
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 oh, I'm never gonna make it, it's so hard.

630
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 Am I gonna pass this year?

631
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Or is it getting careers so that it can be something

632
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 that you like and also has a stable income?

633
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 Or is it to find a godly boyfriend or girlfriend?

634
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 Or is it to want a harmonious relationship

635
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 with your spouse or with your kids?

636
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 Or maybe it's getting your family members

637
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 to come to church, that might be a hurticle.

638
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 A hurticle, what is that?

639
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 (laughs)

640
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 Hurdle.

641
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 And did I just make up a new word?

642
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 (audience laughs)

643
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 Or is it to have your unbearable co-worker

644
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 and how to deal with it?

645
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 Or is it to have better health?

646
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 Whatever it is, take Psalm, one of those prayers

647
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 and just say, yes, I'm facing this problem

648
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 and then say, but you, my God,

649
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 is the one who protects me, is the one who lifts my head,

650
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 is the one who will make a way for me,

651
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 is the one who loves me.

652
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 And if you do that, I believe that it will please God

653
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 and God will lead you into his plans

654
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 and you will fulfill it and you'll see the promised land.

655
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Not see it, 'cause a lot of people see it.

656
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 You'll be in the promised land.

657
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 And sometimes, I just wanna make another note,

658
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 it might not be a big issue.

659
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 Start with the smaller ones.

660
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Remember my missing the minibus example?

661
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Start with the smaller ones.

662
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 You don't have to be in a devastating situation

663
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 I don't want you to be in.

664
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 But try to catch the small ones.

665
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 When you make a mistake, you're like,

666
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 oh, I can never do anything right.

667
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 That's the moment you catch it.

668
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 Or when you feel like, oh, that co-worker

669
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 or that friend just did this to me.

670
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
 Why did I even meet them?

671
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 That's the moment you catch it.

672
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 They're just small things, but start with those.

673
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 And then our faith will continue to grow.

674
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 Because when we think right

675
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 and have the thoughts that God wanted us to have,

676
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 what will we need to fear?

677
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 There's nothing to fear, because we know who is with us.

678
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 It is the almighty God.

679
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 He is with us.

680
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 Whom shall we fear?

681
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 So I really pray, this is my prayer,

682
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 that all of us enter into the land of milk and honey.

683
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Let us pray together.

684
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 Dear heavenly Father,

685
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 we thank you so much for your goodness.

686
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 You're our God.

687
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
 You're the one who saved us,

688
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 who has given your son, Jesus Christ, to us.

689
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 You will not withhold anything good from us.

690
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 And Father, we pray that in all circumstances,

691
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 no matter how big, how small, how challenging it may be,

692
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 so challenging that we feel like we cannot overcome,

693
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 that Father, in that moment, help us take our thoughts captive,

694
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 know what the wrong thoughts are.

695
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Help us, Father, to repeatedly proclaim who you are

696
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 and how good you are to us.

697
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 And Father, we know you are with us the whole time.

698
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 And we just want to thank you.

699
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 You're the awesome God.

700
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 You are with us.

701
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,000
 We shall not fear anything that is ahead.

702
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
