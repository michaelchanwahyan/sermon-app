1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,960
 - Excited to be back here, to be able to share with you.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,360
 I'll give you one minute on the family gathering

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,560
 that we're doing, that we're starting tomorrow,

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,080
 and really praying that the Lord would use it.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,480
 It started really with Christina and I,

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,760
 and then with Joe and his dear wife Alex,

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,160
 who have become parents as well three weeks ago,

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,660
 really asking ourselves, how do we disciple our children?

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,660
 How do we disciple our family?

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,380
 And how do we disciple not just our biological children,

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,060
 but also our spiritual children?

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,720
 How do we live as a family together,

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,720
 that's devoted to one another,

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,840
 to actually walking with one another?

16
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,280
 And so that's why we're doing this,

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,820
 and it's a family gathering, of course,

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,860
 it's child-friendly, but it's not exclusive

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,640
 to just people with children either.

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,200
 But rather it's, how do we explore,

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,900
 how do we invest in what it means to be children of God,

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,940
 to be a family together?

23
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,560
 To not just do church on a, just do 90 minutes,

24
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,160
 one day a week, but to do more than that.

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,200
 What does that actually mean?

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,700
 So that's what the family gathering's about.

27
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,260
 Feel free to come and ask us any questions.

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,120
 So we've been in the UK for this long time,

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,920
 and I forgot how hot it is outside in Hong Kong.

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,520
 I also forgot how cold it is inside as well,

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,760
 with all the air con.

32
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,560
 So those two things were really quite a shock to us.

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,480
 And there's one question that I always dreaded

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,380
 when we got back to Hong Kong.

35
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,920
 Those of you who visit home will probably hear it a lot,

36
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,980
 especially these last few months,

37
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,280
 or sorry, these last few years.

38
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,960
 The question we got all the way was,

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,160
 hey, how's Hong Kong?

40
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,000
 (audience laughing)

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,840
 Right?

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,720
 And then you're like, I don't even know where to start.

43
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,880
 I haven't seen you for three years,

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,940
 I haven't been outside of Hong Kong for three years.

45
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,760
 I don't even know how to appropriately describe to you

46
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,520
 how's Hong Kong, right?

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,840
 Just seen so much.

48
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,000
 In 2003, we were in England when SARS happened.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,120
 2014, we were in England when Occupy Central happened.

50
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,840
 Who would have known that in the short three years

51
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,840
 we had there, we would have both of those events,

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,120
 but enlarged on steroids during our time here.

53
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,720
 And we've just had so many different things

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,540
 that we've had to work around our head.

55
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,960
 Just all the events that have happened,

56
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,200
 and then it's just not even Hong Kong anymore.

57
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,160
 It's the world, right?

58
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,400
 You look at the news,

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,920
 you look on the other side of the world,

60
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,120
 and you look, man, how's the world?

61
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,600
 It's hard.

62
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,280
 And as a believer, it's particularly hard,

63
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,920
 because we have all these tensions

64
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
 that we have to hold, don't we?

65
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,400
 We have all these paradoxical tensions

66
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,440
 that we have to hold.

67
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,760
 At the beginning of the year,

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,060
 our family and I, we were like, you know what?

69
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,660
 It doesn't really matter what's happening outside.

70
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,820
 The one thing that matters the most

71
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,680
 is how we are on the inside,

72
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,460
 how thankful we are on the inside.

73
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,680
 So every night, our family and I, the four of us,

74
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,960
 we went to Muji, we bought a book each,

75
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,060
 and we would do our gratitude book.

76
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,480
 And every day we would think of one thing

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,520
 to be thankful for, and we would write it down.

78
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,000
 Because it's so hard.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,440
 As a believer, how do you make sense of this world,

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,520
 still be grateful, still be filled with gratitude,

81
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,400
 but also still acknowledge that you're grieving,

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
 that you've lost things, you've lost freedom,

83
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,600
 you've lost time with family,

84
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,160
 you've lost things that you wanted to do,

85
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,000
 you've lost your career, whatever it might be.

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,640
 So you have grief, and you have gratitude.

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,080
 How do you hold those things together

88
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,600
 as you see this world seemingly tear itself apart

89
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,240
 or just falling apart at the seams?

90
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,960
 And then we have to rejoice, even in suffering.

91
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,160
 When things are not going well,

92
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,720
 when things are not going the way we want,

93
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,120
 yet somehow this book tells us,

94
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,880
 and if this book is to be believed,

95
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,600
 this book keeps telling us you must rejoice.

96
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,680
 Rejoice in the Lord.

97
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,960
 Again, I will say, rejoice.

98
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,000
 How do you rejoice?

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,360
 Through suffering.

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,640
 How do you turn sorrow into joy?

101
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,160
 These are the paradoxical tensions

102
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,640
 that we as believers have to face, right?

103
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,400
 These are the things that we deal with every day,

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,440
 and I'm sure that you deal with them too.

105
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,680
 One thing that I've realized going back to England

106
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,080
 and seeing my old friends and the simple life that is there,

107
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
 I realized that for me,

108
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
 life has stopped being black and white.

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,840
 I think as you age, as you gain in wisdom,

110
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,240
 suddenly it's, oh, things are not so black and white anymore.

111
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,120
 There's much more of a gray area that we're dealing with.

112
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,560
 And so then really the question is, what then?

113
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,640
 As we're stuck in this world, in this city, with this world,

114
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,360
 how do we as believers act?

115
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,480
 What is it that we should do?

116
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,400
 You guys have been going through

117
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,200
 this book of Ecclesiastes.

118
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,880
 Admittedly, I think Gabriel said this too,

119
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,520
 is it's a complicated book, not one of my favorites.

120
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,040
 It's confusing.

121
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,880
 There's so many layers to it,

122
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,320
 and it's just, he's talking about different things

123
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,520
 and going from different places.

124
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:58,280
 Of course, it's part of this genre called Hebrew wisdom.

125
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,240
 And the kehelet, this preacher,

126
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,760
 Ecclesiastes, Ecclesia is this gathering.

127
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,680
 So this is a gathering of wisdom almost that he does.

128
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,520
 As he gathers his wisdom, he then starts sharing it.

129
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,000
 And the first half of the book

130
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
 that you guys have just been through

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,440
 has been him basically making observations.

132
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,600
 He's treating it as like a scientific experiment

133
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,880
 as he looks at the world and he's seeing all these things.

134
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,240
 And he's making all these observations

135
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,440
 in this first half of the book

136
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,080
 up until the end of chapter six.

137
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,120
 And then in the second half, he starts dropping dimes.

138
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,120
 He starts dropping wisdom on how to deal

139
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,880
 with the observations that he just made.

140
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,600
 Chapter six, at the end, he asked this question.

141
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,480
 It's not on the slides there.

142
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,040
 It says, "For who knows what is good for man

143
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,320
 "while he lives the few days of his vain life,

144
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
 "which he passes like a shadow?"

145
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,240
 For who knows what is good for man?

146
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,600
 He's basically asking the same question I just said.

147
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,720
 As we live in this world, as we see all these things,

148
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
 so what?

149
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,120
 So what?

150
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,480
 What does that mean for us?

151
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,880
 How should we live?

152
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,280
 What is a good way for us to live?

153
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,480
 And as we look at chapter seven,

154
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,240
 the title is "How to be Better Off."

155
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,880
 As we look at chapter seven, I think he tackles this

156
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,480
 as he drops these nuggets of wisdom.

157
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,320
 What he actually does,

158
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,560
 he's actually trying to tune our attitude.

159
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,240
 He's trying to tune our approach

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,520
 and our perspective to life.

161
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,600
 And hopefully, as we tune our perspective to life,

162
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,800
 we will know how to deal with life.

163
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,640
 So that's what he's doing.

164
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,600
 He's targeting, he's attacking our perspective,

165
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,720
 our approach on things.

166
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,280
 And the first thing he does is he attacks

167
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,160
 or he tunes our perspective on two things,

168
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,440
 life and death.

169
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,280
 Life and death.

170
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,520
 Let me show you the verses.

171
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,680
 A good name, chapter seven, verse one.

172
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
 A good name is better than precious ointment

173
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,440
 and the day of death than the day of birth.

174
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,600
 It is better to go to the house of mourning

175
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,560
 than to go to the house of feasting.

176
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,080
 For this is the end of all mankind

177
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,440
 and the living will lay it to heart.

178
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,760
 Sorrow is better than laughter

179
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,840
 for by sadness of face, the heart is made glad.

180
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,120
 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,

181
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,080
 but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

182
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:13,440
 He's saying it's better to be at a funeral

183
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,480
 than to see the birth of a baby.

184
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,520
 Isn't that interesting?

185
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,360
 'Cause no one would say,

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,160
 "Oh, I'd love to go to a funeral this week."

187
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,520
 No one would like to say that.

188
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,920
 He's tackling life by talking about death.

189
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,680
 And death is a topic that none of us

190
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,680
 really like to talk about.

191
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,720
 Chinese culture especially, and I've talked about this,

192
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,480
 we despise, we're terrified of death, right?

193
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,280
 Everything that we do is geared towards avoiding death.

194
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,680
 And every way we describe something,

195
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,880
 something to its extreme,

196
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,720
 we're always talking about death.

197
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,840
 And I've said this before,

198
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

199
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,840
 Everything is safe.

200
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,680
 Because there's something about death

201
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,280
 that we don't know what to do with,

202
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,640
 because we need to control.

203
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,600
 We need to control,

204
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,760
 but yet we don't know how to control death.

205
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,800
 We don't know what to do with it.

206
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,360
 Let me tell you about two kings.

207
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,240
 One of the kings is a guy called Louis XVI in France.

208
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
 He also did not like death.

209
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,280
 And he actually forbid people

210
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,480
 from mentioning the word death in his presence.

211
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,640
 So you were not allowed to.

212
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,680
 You'd have to just work around it,

213
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,040
 or just avoid the topic altogether.

214
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,000
 He didn't like it.

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,760
 There's another king called Philip II of Macedon.

216
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,240
 Macedon is the ancient kingdom of Macedonia.

217
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,480
 He had the opposite approach.

218
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,400
 He wanted to be reminded of death every day.

219
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,720
 He hired a servant to tell him every day at daybreak,

220
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,440
 "Philip, one day you will die."

221
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,040
 That was the job.

222
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,080
 Imagine being that servant.

223
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,440
 What a great job.

224
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,080
 You clock in at 7 a.m., you finish at 7.01,

225
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,120
 and then you have the rest of the day.

226
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,720
 "Philip, one day you will die."

227
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,520
 Reminds me of my daughter, actually.

228
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,000
 My daughter, who's growing in age and observational skills,

229
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
 she looks at me practically every day now, right?

230
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,840
 And she says, "Daddy, you're getting old.

231
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,200
 "You don't have any hair."

232
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,200
 Like, practically every day, she'll remind me of that, right?

233
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,440
 And so Philip II had this servant remind him,

234
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,560
 "Philip, one day you will die,"

235
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,760
 to remind him of his mortality,

236
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,240
 to remind him that life isn't all there is,

237
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,880
 that there is more to that.

238
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,800
 Alan Iverson, one of my favorite basketball players,

239
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,320
 would say, "I play every game as though it's my last."

240
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,920
 And so he had this mindset that,

241
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,960
 "Who knows what will happen?"

242
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,360
 And just to go back to Philip II of Macedon,

243
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,880
 this mindset of being reminded every day,

244
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,800
 "Philip, one day you will die,"

245
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,920
 his child was then Alexander the Great.

246
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
 And it's interesting, isn't it?

247
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,080
 Because death is an interesting thing.

248
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,240
 And I can say I've had an interesting relationship

249
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,040
 with death myself.

250
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,160
 Growing up, I was also afraid of death.

251
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,240
 In fact, there was one point,

252
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,560
 I've shared this story before maybe to some of you,

253
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,080
 as a teenager who was trying to figure out life

254
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,040
 and living completely in the present,

255
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,360
 my dad dragged me aside one day and said,

256
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
 "James, I have this feeling that one day I will die early.

257
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,240
 "The Lord will take me to heaven early."

258
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,320
 And he made me promise him to be true to my calling always.

259
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,520
 And from that day on, I was always thinking about death.

260
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,360
 I remember, so I used to work in McDonald's when I was 16,

261
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,480
 I remember him driving me to McDonald's,

262
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
 he was dropping me off there to go to my shift,

263
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,040
 and then he was actually doing a work trip,

264
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
 so he had to go.

265
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,720
 And in that moment, as I got out of the car

266
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,680
 and said goodbye to him, I was like,

267
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,960
 "Oh, this could be the last time I see my dad."

268
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,360
 Always, have you had that?

269
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,720
 Do you know when you say goodbye to someone

270
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,640
 and you're like, "Oh, this may be the last time."

271
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,960
 I don't know, maybe when you get older and older,

272
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,040
 maybe that becomes more and more common.

273
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,240
 But I had that feeling.

274
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,920
 And then what is in just that work trip,

275
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,720
 it was, "Oh, they're not home yet.

276
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,960
 "I'm just gonna sit outside

277
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
 "and just wait to see if they're back yet."

278
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,520
 And I had this relationship.

279
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,120
 And every time my mind was blank and not thinking anything,

280
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,520
 the word death would pop into my mind.

281
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,120
 It would just always be there.

282
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,400
 And I was terrified of it.

283
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,640
 One year later, he actually did die.

284
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,200
 After a trip to Hong Kong, we went back to England

285
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,720
 and had dinner, and then just at the dinner table,

286
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,760
 just whilst eating, he fell off and that was it.

287
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,600
 He was gone.

288
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,080
 And I'll tell you, that did one thing for me.

289
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,080
 It actually freed me, almost, from that fear of death.

290
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,600
 'Cause it's happened now.

291
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
 Do you know when your worst fear has happened?

292
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,040
 We spent three years avoiding COVID,

293
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,080
 we go to England.

294
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,360
 And then we caught it.

295
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,240
 I caught it, I went to a work trip to New York,

296
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,520
 so I caught the latest strain, the US strain.

297
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,880
 Well, got back to home, oh, caught COVID.

298
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,800
 I remember Paul telling me when he caught COVID

299
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,560
 that he had the worst sore throat he'd ever had.

300
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,320
 And I was like, "You're just weak."

301
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,160
 And then,

302
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,560
 and then I had it,

303
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,200
 and then it was just the worst sore throat I've ever had.

304
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,400
 I mean, I've always known that genetically,

305
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,800
 Paul and I are very similar.

306
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,280
 But for me, it was like, "Oh, we've had it, we've had it."

307
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,080
 And then suddenly you're not as scared.

308
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,840
 Suddenly it's like, "Oh, I've had it already."

309
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
 Death is an interesting one.

310
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,920
 So I wanna ask you, what's your relationship with death?

311
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,640
 'Cause he says here, "It is better to be at the day of death

312
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,680
 "than at the day of a birth."

313
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,960
 What does that mean?

314
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,000
 That means, are you prepared?

315
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,560
 Are you acceptant?

316
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,600
 Are you embracing the fact that you will die?

317
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,960
 For older people, maybe you're better at this.

318
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,880
 For younger people, you live as though you won't ever die.

319
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,560
 Can I share something with you

320
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,600
 that's really sad and really morbid?

321
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,160
 Every single person in this room will die.

322
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,000
 The person you're sat next to right now will die.

323
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,760
 How much do we think about that?

324
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,520
 But it's only when you think about that

325
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,800
 do you then get a better perspective on life.

326
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,240
 Because we've watched the movies where,

327
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,560
 actually, Chinese, again, shows you about death.

328
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,680
 All these TVB legend series are all about

329
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,240
 finding that medicine, the (speaks in foreign language)

330
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,320
 Am I right?

331
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,040
 And then I can live forever.

332
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,640
 And then we've watched the movies

333
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,120
 of the people who do live forever

334
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,320
 because they're immortals in some way

335
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,480
 or vampires in some way,

336
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,720
 and they're pretty, pretty grumpy.

337
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,800
 They're not happy at all.

338
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,000
 Just because you live forever

339
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,240
 doesn't mean you'll live a happy life.

340
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,120
 In fact, it's death.

341
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,080
 That's that expiry date that gives your life meaning,

342
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,680
 that suddenly makes the days that you have valuable.

343
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,320
 How in tune with you, are you, with your own mortality?

344
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,720
 That you know that one day you will die.

345
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,840
 You only get that when you go to a funeral.

346
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,600
 When you meet a young baby,

347
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,000
 you forget about it altogether.

348
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,480
 But one day, all of us will die.

349
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,560
 The Psalmist in 90 says, "Teach me to number my days."

350
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,440
 The Apostle Paul says, "To live is Christ, to die is gain."

351
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,040
 To get to that point where you're like,

352
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,080
 you know what, our amount of life on Earth,

353
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,840
 whether it's 10 years, 20 years, 90 years,

354
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,520
 100 years, 120 years,

355
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,480
 I think the latest oldest man in the world

356
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,560
 is 128 or something.

357
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,880
 All of that is still here.

358
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,680
 And then the rest of eternity is all of this.

359
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
 We've heard the two most important days in your existence

360
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,000
 are today and that day.

361
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,800
 Today, living in the present right now,

362
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,680
 and that day, the moment you meet your creator,

363
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,440
 the moment you walk through death's door

364
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,920
 and you realise that it's not all the end,

365
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,840
 in fact, it's only just the beginning.

366
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,440
 And that's why Paul can say,

367
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,480
 "To live is Christ, to die is gain."

368
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,680
 My desire is to depart and be with Christ,

369
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,840
 for that is far better.

370
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,920
 Because he had the right perspective on life and death.

371
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,160
 What about you?

372
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
 Do you live as though today is your last?

373
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,880
 Now, you can't really live as though today is your last,

374
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,520
 practically speaking.

375
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,760
 That cannot happen, right?

376
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,600
 Because if you did, then you wouldn't go to work,

377
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,000
 you wouldn't do your laundry,

378
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,320
 you wouldn't pay your taxes,

379
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,600
 and then you'd be in trouble the next day

380
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,440
 when you wake up and you're like,

381
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,960
 "Oh man, this is not my last day.

382
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,360
 "I'm in trouble now."

383
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,440
 So practically speaking,

384
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,240
 you can't live as though every day is your last,

385
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,560
 but can you live as though eternity is real?

386
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,920
 Can you live with eternity in mind?

387
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,840
 That actually, everything that I do today

388
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,160
 has earthly significance,

389
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,840
 but also has eternal significance.

390
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,560
 That every decision I make,

391
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,240
 whether it is to do the laundry,

392
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,400
 has an eternal significance.

393
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,720
 How I approach life,

394
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,120
 my perspective towards life and death is so important.

395
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,760
 And so we can be heavenly minded and earthly good.

396
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,080
 So that's the first thing he tackles.

397
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,360
 This perspective on life and death.

398
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,640
 What is your relationship with life and death?

399
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,320
 The second one is, he has an attack on our perspective

400
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,280
 on prosperity and adversity.

401
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,800
 And I'm gonna skip a few verses here

402
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,880
 'cause we won't have time to go through all of them.

403
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
 Verse 14 says this.

404
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,000
 In the day of prosperity, be joyful,

405
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,200
 and in the day of adversity, consider.

406
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,040
 God has made the one as well as the other,

407
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,040
 so that man may not find out anything

408
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,520
 that will be after him.

409
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,920
 In my vain life, I have seen everything.

410
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,600
 There's a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness.

411
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,440
 Oops, sorry.

412
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,200
 A man can't multitask, sorry.

413
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,920
 In my vain life, I have seen everything.

414
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,000
 There is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness,

415
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
 and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life

416
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,080
 in his evil do.

417
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,800
 So there's no guarantee.

418
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,560
 But somehow, some of us treat the faith like that, right?

419
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,160
 If I read my Bible, if I wake up, if I pray,

420
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,960
 if I go to church, then I'm a good person,

421
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,880
 and then blessings will come upon me.

422
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,400
 Then I will live a good life.

423
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,240
 God is for me, not against me,

424
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,680
 so therefore he will help me find a parking space today.

425
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,440
 And everything will be good today.

426
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,360
 And my wedding day will be sunny

427
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,680
 because I'm a righteous person, right?

428
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,520
 But yet, Scripture says very, very clearly,

429
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,760
 Kohelet observes that's not true.

430
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,480
 Matthew 5.45 says,

431
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,800
 "It rains on the righteous and the unrighteous."

432
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,040
 We're all subject to the humidity here in Hong Kong,

433
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,360
 whether you're righteous or not.

434
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,680
 The sun shines on the righteous or the unrighteous.

435
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,440
 It doesn't make a difference

436
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,280
 because the Christian faith, the perspective,

437
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:31,000
 isn't about whether you get a good life or not

438
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,240
 because that's this bit here.

439
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,320
 The Christian life is this, the whole of this.

440
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,120
 And it's a different thing

441
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,440
 because when you remember that,

442
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,160
 then it changes the way you approach

443
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,520
 prosperity and adversity.

444
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,040
 It's important because Kohelet here is saying,

445
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,240
 have a level-headed approach to life.

446
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,600
 Peter says, "Be sober."

447
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,440
 What does that mean?

448
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,760
 Don't get so drunk and high on the things of life

449
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,080
 and also don't drown your sorrows

450
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,600
 when things are not good.

451
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,080
 Have a level-headed approach to things.

452
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,720
 My dear brother and Alex, they recently had their baby

453
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
 and of course, every parent of newborns will know

454
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,000
 how tiring it is, how much of a rollercoaster it is,

455
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,040
 how much you realize

456
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,520
 that you are completely out of your control.

457
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,360
 I remember our two kids

458
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,440
 and you know the one thing I learned when we had our two

459
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,560
 was that there will be good days when you sleep,

460
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,400
 when my wife sleeps, gets to sleep five hours in a row

461
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
 without being interrupted.

462
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,240
 There will be good days but they will never last

463
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,040
 because in a few days' time, there will be bad days

464
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,920
 because there's a growth spurt, there's teething,

465
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,720
 there's colic, there's all these other things

466
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,960
 and there will be bad days.

467
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,160
 And then on the bad days, I remind myself,

468
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,600
 the bad days will also never last.

469
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,840
 Parenting life is just like this.

470
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,200
 There's good days and there's bad days.

471
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,760
 As a believer, how do we approach that?

472
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,800
 Every time something bad happens,

473
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,920
 we're like, "God, why me?

474
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,200
 "Why did I not get that job?"

475
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,040
 Right?

476
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,640
 "Why is it raining today?"

477
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,720
 Can you imagine?

478
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,840
 God's like, "No, I never promised that.

479
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,280
 "In fact, I told you the opposite.

480
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,200
 "I said, in this world, you will have trouble."

481
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,400
 Romans 5, it says, "It's suffering that is gonna be

482
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,080
 "the thing that brings out endurance

483
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,880
 "and then brings out character and then brings out hope."

484
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,600
 James 1, "It's counted all joy when you meet trials

485
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,760
 "of various kinds because it's that testing of your faith

486
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,680
 "that will make you steadfast, it will make you perfect

487
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,080
 "and lacking in nothing."

488
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,480
 I told you, I am your shepherd.

489
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,000
 You shall not want.

490
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,520
 I'll lead you beside still waters, green pastures.

491
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,400
 I will lead you in the right path.

492
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,920
 That's verse three.

493
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,600
 And then he says, "Even though I walk through the valley

494
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
 "of the shadow of death."

495
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,240
 Wait a minute, you just said you would lead me

496
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,200
 in the paths of righteousness for your namesake.

497
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,160
 And then the next verse,

498
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,760
 "I'm walking in the valley of the shadow of death."

499
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,600
 What?

500
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,280
 But that's what the shepherd said.

501
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,960
 I will lead you on the right path

502
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,160
 and the right path is the hard path.

503
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,160
 Adversity.

504
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,680
 How do you approach adversity?

505
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,840
 Are you shocked, devastated

506
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,800
 when you realise not every good thing is happening to me?

507
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,080
 Kohelet here is saying, "Hey, have a different perspective

508
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,840
 "on adversity and prosperity."

509
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,480
 One of my favourite, Allen Iverson is a good player

510
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,320
 that I really liked.

511
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,520
 Steph Curry is one of my absolute favourites.

512
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,680
 And on his shoes with his Under Armour deal,

513
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,920
 he puts Philippines 413.

514
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,600
 "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."

515
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,960
 What a great passage, "I can do all things,

516
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,440
 "all my dreams, my American dream,

517
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,280
 "the house in the suburbs, the wife, the life,

518
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,920
 "the kids, the job, the money.

519
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,160
 "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."

520
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,120
 That is not what that passage is about.

521
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,720
 Because if you just rewind just a few verses,

522
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,360
 he's saying, "Not that I'm speaking of being in need,

523
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,160
 "for I've learned that in whatever situation

524
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
 "I am to be content.

525
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,080
 "I know how to be brought low, I know how to abound.

526
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,520
 "In any and every circumstance, I've learned the secret

527
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,520
 "of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.

528
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,240
 "I can do all things through him who strengthens me."

529
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,600
 That's the context of it.

530
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,280
 That's the perspective of a believer.

531
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,160
 Are we adverse to adversity?

532
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,800
 Are we prone to chasing prosperity?

533
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,000
 Where's your mindset in that?

534
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,600
 Be sober, approach life with a level head.

535
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,880
 And so you, I say, "Okay, I'm coming to the end now.

536
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,320
 "You talked about perspective of life and death.

537
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,520
 "You talked about perspective on adversity and prosperity,

538
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,000
 "but I want some practical advice.

539
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,680
 "What does my day look like today?

540
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,360
 "What does my day look like next week?"

541
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,160
 As you see all these things, Kohelet, preacher,

542
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,360
 gatherer of wisdom, you see all the things that happen,

543
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,760
 you see that it's like this, how do we live?

544
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
 What is something practical that we does?

545
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,600
 And he goes through a few verses

546
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,880
 that I will just fly through a little bit,

547
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,520
 but he does give some practical advice.

548
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,240
 In verses five to 10, he talks about this.

549
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,800
 And see if I can fly through a few of them for you.

550
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,200
 Verse five, "It is better for a man to hear the rebuke

551
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,160
 "of the wise than to hear the song of fools."

552
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,760
 He's saying, "Don't be flattered."

553
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,680
 When you live life, if you want some practical advice,

554
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,280
 here it is, don't be flattered.

555
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,200
 Don't surround yourself with people who will agree with you.

556
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,760
 Don't surround yourself with people

557
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,880
 who will only tell you the things that you want to hear.

558
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,400
 Don't be easily flattered, that's number one.

559
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,560
 And then he carries on.

560
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,400
 "Better is the end of a thing than it is the beginning,

561
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,720
 "and the patient spirit is better than the proud spirit."

562
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,960
 Be patient, be patient, don't be impatient, don't be angry.

563
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,840
 Why?

564
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,520
 Because when you're impatient, you are not loving.

565
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,040
 What?

566
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,680
 But 1 Corinthians 13 says, "Love is patient."

567
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:07,320
 So if you're being impatient, you're actually not

568
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,920
 being loving and you're not trusting in God.

569
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,560
 Gabriel preached on this, Ecclesiastes 3,

570
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,280
 "There is a time for everything."

571
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,560
 You recognize that God is in control of everything

572
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,440
 in all the timing.

573
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,720
 So when you are being impatient, what are you doing?

574
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,280
 You're not trusting in God, right?

575
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,080
 You're not loving Him in the way that you should,

576
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,800
 so don't be impatient.

577
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,400
 And then he carries on.

578
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,080
 Oh, verse 10, "Say not, 'Why were the former days

579
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,120
 "better than these?'

580
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,560
 "For it is not from wisdom that you ask this."

581
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,080
 Don't be proud and discontent.

582
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,240
 Who's ever said that?

583
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,720
 The good old days, this is not like the good old days.

584
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,240
 Hong Kong has changed so much.

585
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,640
 This Hong Kong is nothing like the Hong Kong of the '90s.

586
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,320
 Don't we say that?

587
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,600
 Oh, young people these days, they're idiots.

588
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,240
 (audience laughing)

589
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,360
 Right?

590
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,600
 He says, "Don't say that."

591
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,440
 Why?

592
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,600
 Because you're being prideful.

593
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,560
 Because you're being discontent with what it is.

594
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,600
 Because nothing new is happening under the sun.

595
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,480
 So stop making your comments from your rose-tinted glasses.

596
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,680
 Because here's the problem.

597
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,480
 When you start comparing these days to those days,

598
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,920
 that comparison breeds discontentment.

599
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,440
 That discontentment breeds resentment.

600
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,080
 It's pride.

601
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,120
 Don't do that.

602
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,480
 We all love those elderly women or men

603
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,000
 who are just so gracious and gentle and patient,

604
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,520
 even though they've been through everything.

605
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,680
 They've seen all the financial crises.

606
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,280
 They've been through the wars.

607
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,440
 They've seen everything,

608
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,360
 yet they are just so patient with us.

609
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,760
 You don't hear them saying, "The good old days."

610
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,880
 They don't make it like this anymore.

611
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,160
 Because they have the right perspective.

612
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,040
 And Kohelet's asking us to have that perspective.

613
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,120
 And I'll finish here.

614
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,560
 Because again, if you look at chapter seven,

615
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,920
 please, when you go home and look at it,

616
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,360
 he jumps around and bounces around in lots of places.

617
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,560
 He talks about perspective,

618
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,240
 then he gives a few wisdoms, droplets of wisdom,

619
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,840
 and then he just carries on

620
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
 with some more perspective issues.

621
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,520
 And then he finishes this chapter

622
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,560
 with something which is interesting,

623
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,880
 because he's talking about how to be wise.

624
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,600
 And then towards the end of it, from 16 onwards,

625
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,320
 he's actually, "You know what?

626
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,960
 This whole wisdom thing,

627
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,480
 it's not really what it's cracked out to be."

628
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,880
 He says, "Be not overly righteous

629
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,360
 and do not make yourself too wise.

630
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,720
 Why should you destroy yourself?

631
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,400
 Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool.

632
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,080
 Why should you die before your time?"

633
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,240
 And then he's, so he's basically attacking wisdom.

634
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,360
 He's like, you know what he's actually saying here?

635
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,520
 Avoid extremism.

636
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,640
 Don't be too conservative and rigid,

637
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,240
 but don't be immoral and go all the way to this side either.

638
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,720
 Avoid those extremes.

639
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,000
 Going to the States,

640
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,320
 and actually anywhere in the world right now,

641
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,280
 we see how polarized everything is, right?

642
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,160
 Republicans and Democrats and conservatives and liberals

643
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,080
 and all these other colors

644
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,480
 that we're using to identify with a color,

645
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,720
 and everyone's just going to the extremes.

646
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,720
 And Cohen is here saying, "You know what all those are?

647
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,520
 Those are all earthly wisdom at best.

648
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,400
 At best, they are earthly wisdom."

649
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:39,080
 Come back away from the sidelines and into the middle.

650
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,040
 Jesus, when he assembled his 12 avengers, disciples,

651
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,840
 he's chose them from all along the spectrum,

652
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,640
 and he caught them into the middle.

653
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,280
 And he was the most radical leader ever

654
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,840
 because he realized, he had the perspective

655
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,720
 that these sections here, these divisions here

656
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,560
 are not important here.

657
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,360
 They are not important.

658
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,040
 They are earthly wisdom at best.

659
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,240
 And Cohen here is saying, and he says this in verse 20,

660
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,080
 which I think I do have,

661
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,400
 "Surely there is not a righteous man on earth

662
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,160
 who does good and never sins.

663
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,600
 All this I have tested by wisdom.

664
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,760
 I said I will be wise, but it was far from me."

665
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,960
 He's like, "I've tried.

666
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,360
 I've asked for wisdom.

667
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,680
 I have seen everything.

668
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,200
 And if it's to be believed,

669
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,320
 some people believe this is Solomon,

670
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,520
 the wisest man that ever lived,

671
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
 who asked God for wisdom and got it.

672
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,480
 But he said, "I've tried.

673
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,680
 I've got everything, all the wisdom, all the observations,

674
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,120
 and it's still so far from me.

675
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,240
 It has still eluded me.

676
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,360
 You can't get it.

677
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,200
 There is nothing."

678
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,920
 And then he finishes with this really depressing statement

679
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,320
 towards the end, "See, this alone I found,

680
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,280
 that God made man upright,

681
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,680
 but they have sought out many schemes,

682
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,440
 that God made us this way,

683
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,640
 but then we have sought out many schemes.

684
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,680
 We have gone another way."

685
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,760
 So that's why he says in verse 20,

686
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,680
 "Surely there is not a righteous man on earth

687
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,120
 who does good and never sins."

688
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,960
 Why?

689
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,080
 Because we may have wisdom,

690
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,720
 but sometimes we don't act on it.

691
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,480
 Solomon, the most wise man ever.

692
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,560
 Have you seen how he ends his life?

693
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
 Have you seen how many,

694
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,320
 have you heard how many concubines he had?

695
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,840
 Everyone knows one wife is more than enough.

696
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,760
 That wasn't very wise.

697
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,480
 Because it's one thing knowing what to do,

698
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,640
 and then it's another thing actually doing it.

699
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,560
 And he says, "You know what?

700
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,000
 I've seen it all.

701
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,040
 You can't even get that kind of wisdom."

702
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,240
 Romans 7, that's what he's doing,

703
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,680
 and that's what we are.

704
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,800
 "For we know what we should do, but we don't,

705
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,440
 and we know what we shouldn't do, but we do.

706
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,680
 Every time I try doing something good,

707
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,040
 sin is right there with me."

708
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,960
 And what does Paul say?

709
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,240
 "What wretched men we are.

710
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,240
 What wretched men we are."

711
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,440
 And that's what Kohelet here is saying.

712
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,520
 He's like, "You may just even give up

713
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
 that search for wisdom.

714
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,360
 I've been everywhere.

715
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,200
 I've seen everything.

716
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,040
 I can't find it.

717
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,880
 I don't know where it is."

718
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,080
 We are not capable of attaining that wisdom

719
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,400
 and acting on it.

720
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,680
 There is no one who is upright

721
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,920
 and no one who ever sins.

722
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,080
 And it's interesting for us,

723
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,560
 because as a species, as a race,

724
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,160
 we're trying to improve ourselves over the years,

725
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,920
 whether it's technology, science, medicine,

726
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,680
 all these things, we're trying to improve our lives.

727
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,400
 We're trying to extend our lives.

728
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,840
 And yes, maybe the quantity of our days are extended,

729
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:44,000
 but the quality, are we really that much wiser?

730
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,200
 Is this world really that much better

731
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,560
 in our pursuit for wisdom, in our pursuit in science,

732
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,680
 in our pursuit in all these things?

733
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,040
 Are we still in the same place?

734
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,840
 In fact, in those pursuits,

735
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,440
 aren't we also bringing the end of the world closer?

736
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,600
 And that's Kohelet's observation.

737
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,040
 BC, and this is where I'll finish.

738
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,160
 He said he'd seen everything.

739
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,840
 He said he'd seen every man

740
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,560
 and there was no one who's upright.

741
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,840
 But who didn't he see?

742
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,880
 Because he lived in a time in the Old Testament

743
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,600
 where he didn't get a chance to see one who was upright,

744
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,320
 who was perfect.

745
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,680
 And as we sang earlier, that King,

746
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,160
 that King from heaven, who came to earth,

747
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,640
 he was upright.

748
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,960
 He did have wisdom and he did live it out.

749
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,880
 Of course, that person is Jesus.

750
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,440
 Kohelet was a wise man.

751
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,280
 He made so many observations

752
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,080
 and they're all good practical advice.

753
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,320
 And unfortunately, he makes these conclusions

754
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,600
 which are not wrong.

755
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,680
 But then if you fast forward, as the story continues,

756
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:04,400
 he would know, and I'm sure he finally got to meet

757
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,080
 there was one who was wise.

758
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,480
 There was one who was truly perfect, who did never sin.

759
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,880
 1 Corinthians 1, many years later,

760
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,920
 Paul talks about this issue of wisdom.

761
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,640
 He says, "Where is the one who is wise?

762
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,720
 "Where is described?

763
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,160
 "Where is the debater of this age?

764
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,720
 "Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?

765
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,840
 "For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,

766
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,640
 "but we preach Christ crucified."

767
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:38,280
 And Jesus himself, Jesus himself is the wisdom of God.

768
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,200
 He is the one who is upright.

769
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,040
 He is the one who is wise.

770
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,200
 So if you want any practical advice on how to live,

771
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,400
 if you want any practical advice on how to be better off,

772
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,800
 look to Jesus.

773
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,800
 Find your answer in Jesus.

774
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,760
 If you are struggling with your perspective

775
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,720
 on life and death, look to Jesus,

776
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,920
 because he came and he defeated death

777
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,000
 so that people like me are no longer afraid of death,

778
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,040
 because I know what it really just is.

779
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,840
 It's just here.

780
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:19,480
 If you are struggling with your life

781
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,880
 and there are challenges and there is adversity,

782
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,120
 or you are also blessed with prosperity,

783
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,360
 and you're wondering, "What do I do?"

784
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,200
 Look to Jesus.

785
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,240
 Jesus is the only one who is wise.

786
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,640
 Focus on this book.

787
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,800
 This book, all these chapters from before,

788
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,320
 point to him.

789
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,760
 He is the wisdom.

790
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,240
 He is the power of God.

791
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,720
 He is the very thing we need to navigate this world

792
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,040
 that is so gray, that is so up and down,

793
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,120
 that is so messed up.

794
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,680
 Focus on him.

795
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,680
 Jesus is the centre and the answer to everything.

796
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,320
 Find him and the answers will be there.

797
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,160
 Let's pray.

798
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,480
 (footsteps)

799
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:21,120
 Father, we come before you with broken hearts,

800
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,640
 because we look at this world and we see so much suffering.

801
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,520
 We see so much death.

802
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,920
 We see so much adversity.

803
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:36,960
 We see so much prosperity that is blinding the eyes

804
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,960
 of those who have it.

805
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,560
 But we come before you and we ask you to once again

806
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,440
 turn our sorrow into joy, our suffering into rejoicing.

807
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,440
 And we wait for you and we take heart

808
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,160
 because we know that you have overcome the world

809
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,640
 despite all its troubles.

810
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,320
 So let us not grow cynical.

811
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,640
 Let us not grow prideful.

812
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,280
 Let us approach life and death,

813
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,440
 adversity and prosperity through your lens.

814
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,320
 Every challenge we face, let us bring back to you.

815
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,960
 Every victory we have, let us boast only in you.

816
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:32,360
 Every day we live, let us live for you.

817
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,480
 We live today for that day.

818
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,120
 We thank you.

819
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,160
 In your name we pray.

820
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,920
 Amen.

821
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:55,920
