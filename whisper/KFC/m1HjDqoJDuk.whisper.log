[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.480]   Last week was my wedding anniversary.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.600]   My 47th wedding anniversary.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:28.880]   Yeah, I know, Sandra deserves a medal for long suffering.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.520]   So every year I try to do my little bit by taking her away.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.640]   As we're at the moment not able to travel overseas or even to Macau or China, I selected
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.040]   Tai O on Lantau Island and the Heritage Hotel.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.400]   Anyone ever been there?
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.400]   Amazing.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.000]   Now, Tai O is known as the Venice of Hong Kong and it's about as non-Hong Kong as you
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400]   can get in Hong Kong.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.200]   It's houses built, I'm gonna show him up here, on stilts across canals.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:15.800]   But the problem we have anywhere in Hong Kong is what we call Pastor John Syndrome.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:23.640]   We hope, we pray every year we can escape it and that we can have an anniversary in
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:32.760]   peace without someone coming up to us and saying, "Hi, Pastor John."
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.240]   So back to last week.
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.000]   Sandra and I were ready to enjoy our anniversary dinner at the Hotel's Outlook Restaurant.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:52.120]   Now, it may not be Michelin star quality, but it's very nice and very romantic.
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.480]   I'd organize a special menu with a special cake.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.040]   So we're all set for the evening.
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:11.960]   A glass of wine, just the two of us.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:19.840]   Then the dreaded thing, the one thing we had feared happened.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.440]   You guess.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.160]   Pastor John.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.400]   A smart young man, late 20s, early 30s.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.920]   Politely I said, "Oh, hi."
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.560]   Then he said, "Do you remember me?"
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.560]   Now, I have to tell you, this is a pastor's nightmare.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.480]   After all, we are supposed to remember everybody.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.320]   Yeah, right.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.960]   But my answer was perfect.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.440]   Why, yes.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.440]   Remind me of your name.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.000]   It was Leo.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.320]   Now, this is a tip for you guys.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.280]   The trick is that when someone tells you the name, you use that name repeatedly over the
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.840]   next few minutes as much as you can.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.680]   "Sandra, you remember Leo.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.320]   We met Leo at church a while back, but this guy soon followed up.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.880]   Do you remember praying for me?"
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.080]   "Yes, I think so."
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.520]   A little bit more hesitantly.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.960]   "Do you remember what you prayed for?"
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.680]   Now, I'm thinking we're getting very close to the end of this charade.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.120]   But I stupidly perhaps fire one more bullet.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.160]   I said, "Just remind me."
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.360]   He then gave a blow by blow account.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.720]   To be honest, it was actually very encouraging.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:26.920]   And then he said, "I just wanted to tell you how much that prayer changed my life."
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.320]   Then it happened.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:46.160]   Suddenly, he pulls up a chair and says, "Do you mind if I sit down?"
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.680]   "Do you mind if I sit down?"
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.560]   Quickly, I responded, quite respectfully.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.680]   "I'd love to hear about it, but tonight we're celebrating our wedding anniversary.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.280]   And we're having a special night out.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.480]   Can I take your WhatsApp and perhaps connect another time?
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.640]   Okay."
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:26.440]   The guy looked at Sandra and he said, "Happy anniversary."
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.000]   Sandra smiled politely.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:38.080]   He immediately turned his attention to me and began to sit down at the chair.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.200]   "Yamo gacho."
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.040]   My options weren't great at that time.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.480]   My hands went all clammy.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.360]   I had a knot in my stomach.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:06.800]   On one hand, I could invite this stranger to a special anniversary dinner.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   On the other hand, what I was gonna say to him and actually I did, of course, was gonna
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   make Pastor John seem very insensitive.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:29.080]   The point of the story is not to convince you how insensitive or how romantic I am,
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.520]   depending on your personal viewpoint.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.240]   The point is to look at the velocity, the speed of the moment.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.400]   It only took a millisecond for the guy.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.680]   By the way, he was really a nice guy.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:55.440]   It only took a millisecond for the guy to pull up a seat at our table.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:11.400]   And the same can be true for how fast the enemy can pull up a seat at our table.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.760]   Louis Guggenheim says this, I've put it on the screen.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:22.680]   In less time than it takes to snap your fingers, if you're not careful, the enemy can pull
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:30.560]   up a seat at the table that the shepherd has prepared for you.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.000]   Suddenly it's not just you and God Almighty at the table.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.440]   Remember week one, it's not just you and God Almighty.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:49.280]   Now it's you, God, and the devil.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:54.400]   The enemy only needs the tiniest crack.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.240]   He only needs a sliver of opportunity.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.200]   The smallest window of doubt or opportunity.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.680]   Like when you get a friend's WhatsApp and you read it, you read it the wrong, wrong
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.080]   way and you get offended.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080]   Have you done that?
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:20.360]   Just like that, the devil is sitting at your table beginning to win the battle for your
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   mind.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:27.320]   Church, I'm sorry.
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.240]   I'm not gonna stand for it.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.080]   Tonight I'm gonna call it out.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.440]   I'm gonna give the enemy what we'll now call the Leo treatment.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.400]   A bit more theologically sound than the expression, the Leo treatment.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.040]   And I'll be covering it this week and next week.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:59.520]   But a better way of putting this is taking back our freedom, which is why I'm so amazed
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.920]   when you pray what you prayed for at the prayer meeting before the service.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.160]   We're gonna talk about taking back our freedom.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:16.040]   Now the big problem is that we have come to accept the enemy sitting at our table.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.640]   The truth is particularly in a place like Hong Kong.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.640]   Hey, do you know what?
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.920]   One thing I noticed about Hong Kong, when you go into an elevator or a lift, there are
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.440]   two buttons, the door closed and the door open.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.680]   Have you noticed that the door open is pristine?
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.000]   There's no marks on it.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.840]   The door closed is completely rubbed out, right?
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.080]   Because people just doing this.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.500]   That's Hong Kong, right?
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.840]   No one presses door open button in Hong Kong.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.640]   Maybe we could start.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.480]   But we say things like this, "Oh, it's just the way it is."
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:56.560]   These days, anxiety is just part of the equation.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:01.980]   We are all anxious and there is nothing we can do about it.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:08.320]   The political situation, the virus, life is so chaotic.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.200]   Of course I worry.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.480]   Don't you read the news headlines?
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:21.600]   Why wouldn't I be afraid?
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:32.880]   In the same way, we believe the lie that we're not worth much to God or to anyone else for
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.840]   that matter.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:41.840]   We think people don't get us.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.080]   Our parents don't get us.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.360]   Our spouse doesn't get us.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.480]   Our boss just doesn't get us.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:11:00.280]   Or they don't value us.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.920]   Or we flip to the other point of view.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:09.520]   I call it the entitlement syndrome.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.320]   And Hong Kong has this in spades, in abundance.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.040]   We think that we deserve.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:30.560]   We deserve more so we allow envy and greed and comparison to cannibalize our God-given
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.400]   identity.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:39.240]   I mean, James is actually sitting there this afternoon, actually saying to himself, "John
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:42.720]   is twice my age.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.960]   Why does he still have hair?"
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:12:02.360]   Actually, actually, I think God gave it to Johnny.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:16.680]   And the worst thing, social media, as you scroll through IG, Facebook, and the like,
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:28.600]   we become even more determined to get what other people have, or better still, more.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   More stuff.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.480]   That's what we need.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.280]   More friends, as if they're real friends.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.640]   More layers of protection.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:46.760]   More likes.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:56.480]   Or maybe another table.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:10.240]   Why stress for a little lust here, or a moment or two of pleasure there?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:16.860]   Before you know it, you start to talk like the devil and think the thoughts he wants
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.760]   you to dwell on.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.000]   And you shrug your shoulders and say, "That's just the way it is."
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Right?
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.560]   I want to say no.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:33.760]   No, no, no, no, and then no.
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:41.200]   I want you to look at what the Apostle Paul told the church in Rome.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.720]   Maybe we could read this together.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.720]   Romans 8.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.680]   Romans 8, one of my favorite chapters of the whole Bible.
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.680]   We get to verse 10, and it says this.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.680]   Roll together.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.680]   Ready?
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.680]   One, two, three.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:59.120]   "If the Spirit is in you, then even through your body is a subject to death because of
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.120]   sin.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.800]   The Spirit gives life because of righteousness.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:10.720]   And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.520]   Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of His Spirit who
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.160]   lives in you.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:24.920]   Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation, but it is not to the flesh to
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.360]   live according to it."
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.000]   We had different versions, right?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.320]   It's good to read different versions of the Bible.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.040]   Let me try and save this.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   I'll read it to you.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:45.680]   "But if Christ is in you, then even through your body is subject to death because of sin.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.000]   The Spirit gives life because of righteousness.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.800]   And if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, He who raised
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.760]   Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies because of His Spirit who
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.480]   lives in you.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:11.240]   Therefore, brothers and sisters, we have an obligation, but it's not to the flesh to live
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.600]   according to it."
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:28.640]   Now, what that means is we can say no, we must say no to the enemy in Jesus' name.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:35.120]   The same power that raised Christ from the dead lives in you.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:44.080]   Jesus has broken the power of sin and God's invitation to the table comes with an invitation
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:51.800]   to embrace a new mindset and a new way of living.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:58.280]   In Jesus' name, we don't have to let the voice of the enemy control the way we live.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:02.640]   In Jesus' name, we don't have to give in to sinful desires.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.920]   We can win the battle for our minds.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.960]   We sing the song, don't we?
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.160]   Thanks to Jesus, we are no longer slaves.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.540]   We are set free.
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:18.320]   We are alive.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.640]   You are His beloved child whom He loves in you.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.640]   He is well pleased.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.260]   And I'm gonna come back to that later.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:34.440]   But for now, I wanna come back to Psalm 23, our anchor passage for this series.
[00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:43.200]   And I believe we create a problem for ourselves when we only read the first part of Psalm
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.960]   23, verse 4.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:54.180]   We read this, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death."
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:17:01.260]   And what happens is we read that and we act like it's the end of the sentence.
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.300]   And we opt out of what comes next.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:11.580]   "I will fear no evil for you are with me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:18.420]   What happens is we like to camp in the valley and stay there.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:30.380]   In trials, when temptation comes, we think this, "Well, I'm really in the valley now.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:32.940]   God didn't come through for me.
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.760]   I prayed for this.
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.760]   God didn't answer.
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:41.780]   Well, God didn't answer in the way I wanted.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:48.020]   So I'm gonna stay in the valley."
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:55.340]   I was obedient to God, but God didn't reward me as I'd hoped.
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:03.080]   So I'm gonna turn to sin in an effort to make me feel better.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.980]   Did you hear that?
[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:13.200]   A chair is being dragged across the floor.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:18.820]   It is still a table for two.
[00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:25.580]   But Leo, or should I say the enemy in this case, has shown up.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:34.700]   And so I've described Leo Mark II as your swift and vicious enemy.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.700]   This is how he behaves.
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:47.660]   When he arrives at your table, he's quiet at first.
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.940]   You may not recognize him as he sits down.
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:19:01.580]   He might just help himself to your chocolate brownie, wiping his mouth inadvertently with
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:04.900]   your napkin.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:16.080]   Just make no mistake, the devil does not appear in a Halloween costume with horns and a pitchfork.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:23.780]   The Bible says that he masquerades as an angel of light.
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.500]   This is more likely what he'll say to you.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.540]   "Hey, buddy.
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.540]   How's it going?"
[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:43.660]   If you're Australian, he'll probably say, "Mate, you doing okay?
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.940]   You don't look so good.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:52.700]   How's everything at work?
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.780]   I honestly don't know how you do it.
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.780]   Your boss is such a jerk."
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.220]   By the way, this is not for James, Johnny, Michelle, and Bonnie.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:06.460]   I'm just saying, right?
[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.740]   Your boss is such a jerk.
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:19.920]   I mean, you really are such a trooper to hang on in there and put up with that idiot.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.140]   So how are things at home?
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.140]   Still rough?
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:31.460]   "Man, I pity you.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.620]   Mind if I have another cupcake?
[00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:37.020]   These things are delicious."
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:42.460]   He might even start quoting the Bible to you.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:51.180]   You know, one of the devil's favorite pastimes is quoting scripture out of context.
[00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:58.700]   But to demonstrate, I want to take you to Matthew 4 and Luke 4, where Satan tried to
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.060]   do a Leo.
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:08.020]   He tried to slip into a seat at Jesus' table.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:15.100]   Now during Jesus' baptism, his heavenly father identified three foundational truths that
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:21.020]   were essential to Jesus' life and ministry.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:27.580]   I want to take a look at what these appear to be because these are the three primary
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.460]   foundation stones of Jesus' life and ministry.
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.900]   They're all found in Luke 4, verse 11.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:42.340]   "Firstly, God said to Jesus, 'You are my son.'"
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:49.380]   Jesus had come to learn from who his father was and what his true identity and value was
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.380]   from his father's perspective.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.780]   He then said, "Whom I love."
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.540]   Jesus had a tested and proven knowledge of his father's love.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.620]   His relationship with his father was secure.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.460]   It wasn't based on performance.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:12.820]   It wasn't down to how many grade A's he got at school.
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.100]   Number three, "With you, I am well pleased."
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:21.700]   Jesus had learned that his primary purpose and motivation for life and ministry was bringing
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:30.620]   joy and glory to his father above anything and everyone else.
[00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:39.140]   These two are actually the foundation stones of your Christian walk.
[00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:46.500]   I want to say to you again, you've heard me say this to you before, that you are his child.
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:52.900]   He loves you and he's proud of you.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:57.060]   I need to say it again because for some of you it's hard to take.
[00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.620]   You are his child.
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:07.820]   He loves you and he is proud of you.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:10.700]   Every one of you.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:17.060]   Now immediately following this occasion, so Jesus has been affirmed by the father, anointed
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.820]   for public ministry.
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:27.540]   He was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the evil one, Satan.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:37.700]   And Satan is thinking, "I'm just wondering if I can get a seat at his table."
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:43.500]   You read this, Luke 4 verse 12, "At once the Spirit sent him out into the wilderness and
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.180]   he was in the wilderness 40 days being tempted by Satan.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.100]   He was with the wild animals and angels attended him."
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:24:00.780]   Now the interesting thing about this account is to note exactly, exactly what the temptations
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.140]   were targeting.
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:09.180]   And to help us, we're going to look at the fuller account of them in Matthew's gospel.
[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:15.420]   Firstly, God had said, "You are my son."
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.260]   That was his identity, right?
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.740]   Then we read, "40 days in he was hungry."
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:31.540]   Verse three, "The tempter came and said to him, 'If you are the son of God, tell these
[00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.180]   stones to become bread.'"
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.300]   Can you see what's happened here?
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.300]   God said, "You're my son."
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:43.940]   Satan said, "If you are God's son, tell these stones to become bread."
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:51.460]   Do you remember in the garden of Eden with Eve?
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:58.340]   Satan said to Eve, "Did God really say?"
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.900]   And that's one of his main entry points to your table.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:07.220]   He will say to you, "Did God really say that?
[00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.740]   Did God really say you're not to cheat on your expenses at work?
[00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:17.100]   Did God really say you're not to sleep with your boyfriend before you get married?
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:20.620]   Did God really say this?"
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:25.700]   Secondly, God said, "Whom I love."
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:26.700]   His relationship.
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:33.220]   Then we read this, "The devil took him to the holy city and had him stand at the highest
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.220]   point of the temple."
[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.260]   He used that word, "If" again.
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.940]   If you are the son of God, throw yourself down.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:48.060]   "For it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you and they will lift up you in
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.740]   his hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:59.500]   What he's saying here is, if God loves you, he will send his angels.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:04.740]   He was challenging his relationship with the father.
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:14.140]   And thirdly, he said this, "God had said, 'With you I am well pleased.'"
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:18.580]   He said this, "Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.220]   kingdoms of the world and their splendor.
[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:27.060]   All this I will give you, I'll give you all, if you will bow down and worship me."
[00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:29.700]   He's saying, "Forget about your purpose, the cross."
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.060]   It's gonna be painful.
[00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.300]   "I can give it to you now."
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:39.260]   The shortcut.
[00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:44.260]   So what we see here is Satan is questioning Jesus' identity, his relationship with his
[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:47.180]   father and his purpose in life.
[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:54.780]   And by doing this, tempts Jesus to prove his sonship and significance.
[00:26:54.780 --> 00:27:03.280]   He pressures him to take things into his own hands by not waiting for the father's leading
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.300]   or provision.
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:09.180]   But here is the key.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:20.500]   But Jesus, quoting Scripture, "Man shall not live by bread alone.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.960]   Do not put your Lord God to the test.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.940]   Worship the Lord and serve Him only."
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:35.340]   Jesus shows he's secure in who he is, confident of his father's love and focused on pleasing
[00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:42.740]   his father above all else by choosing not to give into this temptation in spite of his
[00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:45.780]   life-threatening thirst and hunger.
[00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:51.860]   My friends, this is the answer.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:58.780]   The Word of God.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:07.420]   I wanna encourage you to read it.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.800]   Get into a regular Bible reading plan.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.580]   If you don't have one, come and ask one of the pastors.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.760]   We will suggest one for you.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:25.540]   Make a habit of reading it or listening to it every day.
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.660]   But don't just read it.
[00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:32.700]   Digest it.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:37.260]   Allow it to speak to you.
[00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.660]   Join a clan.
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:45.100]   Grab a journal and write down.
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.340]   Remember those old things we used to have pens?
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:53.020]   Write down what God is saying to you.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:58.940]   But don't just read it and don't just digest it.
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.660]   Live it.
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:11.540]   The Word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword.
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:16.900]   And above all, be aware.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.900]   Be aware.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:27.620]   I said earlier, in less time than it takes to snap your fingers, if you're not careful,
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:33.460]   the enemy can pull a seat up at the table that the shepherd has prepared for you.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:41.220]   And when we open our Bibles, we don't have to wait very long to see this.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:50.020]   In fact, it's on page four in my Bible, in Genesis chapter three.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:58.260]   As I said earlier, the devil in the form of a serpent showed Eve the forbidden fruit and
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:06.100]   pointed out how beautiful it was.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.740]   What's he saying to Eve at this time?
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.940]   Surely, surely God's withholding something from you.
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.820]   Something you truly need.
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:26.780]   And soon, we find Eve nodding her head and convincing her husband, Adam, that the fruit
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:37.380]   was indeed good for food, pleasing to the eye, and desirable for gaining wisdom.
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:46.020]   In whatever way the devil gains access to your table, the goals are the same.
[00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:52.260]   He wants to gain access to your mind so that he can destroy you.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:59.100]   He wants to get inside your head with harmful thoughts that could be planted within you.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:05.580]   In short, he wants to kill your relationship with God.
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:14.060]   The Bible tells us that he's always prowling like a roaring lion, waiting for someone to
[00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:16.620]   devour.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:25.100]   My friends, that someone is you.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:27.940]   And I want to tonight pray for you.
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:32.660]   I want to pray for us.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:36.460]   I want to ask this question as I conclude.
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.820]   I put it on the screen.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:44.740]   Has the enemy taken a seat?
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.660]   It's not up to us to stop him prowling.
[00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:54.180]   But it is up to us to stop him sitting at our table, just as it was up to me that night
[00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:59.460]   to stop Leo sitting at my table.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:06.500]   Rest assured, you have the power as a son or daughter to exercise the faith that says
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:10.820]   in Jesus' name, I won't entertain your words.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.540]   I won't entertain your thoughts.
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:14.540]   I won't entertain your influence.
[00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:22.620]   And we're going to pray this right now.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:34.020]   But I'm wondering, what if he's already sitting there and we've not even recognised he's there?
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:39.020]   You become so accustomed to negative thoughts and destructive emotions, you don't even realise
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:45.940]   he's taken bites out of your pizza.
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:55.080]   Next week, I will continue exposing the deadly lies of the enemy and how they can be extinguished
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.500]   in Jesus' name.
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.660]   That's a spoiler alert and an advertisement for next week.
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:08.220]   What I'm going to ask you to do now is to stand up.
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:21.220]   As the band comes back, we're going to sing a song in a moment.
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:28.820]   The words in the song are these, "Even what the enemy means for evil, you turn it for
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.340]   our good.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.260]   You turn it for our good and for your glory.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.220]   Even in the valley, you are faithful.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.460]   You're working for our good.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.140]   You're working for our good and for your glory.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.460]   Your plans are still to prosper.
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.500]   You've not forgotten us.
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.520]   You're with us in the fire and the flood.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.900]   You're faithful forever.
[00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:57.260]   Perfect in love.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.300]   You are sovereign over us."
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.300]   Just close your eyes.
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:10.440]   As we prayed tonight in the pre-service prayer, we had a sense that God was shining his light
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.580]   upon us as a congregation.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:20.020]   Now because we think that way, what we're thinking is one of those lights, like a search
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:24.180]   light, you know, in these movies when they're after the criminals, they put the search lights
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:31.060]   on and that God is trying to look for all the things we've done wrong.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.420]   That is not the light that God is shining tonight.
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.740]   He comes along as a good shepherd.
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:41.820]   You know those little lights with the lantern.
[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:48.420]   And God said, "I want to shine a light on your life so I can point the way, so I can
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.500]   set you on the right path."
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.780]   He's not here tonight to call out all the things you've done wrong.
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:57.900]   You know what they are.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.780]   You don't need me to tell you that.
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.780]   And God certainly isn't going to do that.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.220]   God say, "I want to put you on the right path."
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.900]   Now being on the right path might be turning for what you know was wrong and going on that
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.900]   path.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:17.120]   But we're going to pray right now.
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.500]   If you're happy to do so, maybe just open your hands in front of you to receive what
[00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:26.660]   God has for you.
[00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:47.040]   I'm going to pray firstly a prayer, which basically says no to the enemy.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:53.720]   We do not want the enemy to be a Leo at our table.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:36:00.060]   And we say to the enemy now in Jesus' name, no.
[00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:05.080]   We say no to the thoughts that you're trying to put in our minds.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:13.440]   We say no to the actions you're trying to help us do, things to harm us.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:18.860]   We say no to the temptation, a little sin here and there, doesn't matter.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:24.880]   We break these things off in the name of Jesus.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.360]   And we still your voice.
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:34.440]   We pray protection around this congregation, this church, upon every Christ follower in
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:40.120]   this city.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:43.220]   The enemy's had a filled day these last couple of years.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:47.040]   To what's been going on outside.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.000]   And our minds have been all over the place.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:02.520]   Lord, we choose today to come back to you, the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:10.040]   Protect us from the lies of the enemy, we pray.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:19.560]   And Lord, where many of us have actually allowed the enemy, maybe inadvertently, to take a
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.980]   seat at our table.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.480]   We pray.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.480]   We pray today.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.720]   And we're going to sing it in a moment.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:39.000]   And what the enemy has meant for evil, you will turn for our good.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.080]   Lord, we are not condemned.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.360]   The enemy would condemn us.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:58.160]   But Lord, you would convict us of sin and you would show us the right way forward.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:06.240]   I pray that your word would be a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.520]   Show me the way to go.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:18.400]   Lord, we as a church come before you right now and commit ourselves afresh to you.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:26.040]   And say, Lord, would you guide our paths.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:35.960]   You are the good shepherd and we are your people.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.880]   Join our hearts in unity with one another and with you.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.600]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   Amen.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.640]   Let's sing this together.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.200]   Sovereign over us.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:49.720]   Amen.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
