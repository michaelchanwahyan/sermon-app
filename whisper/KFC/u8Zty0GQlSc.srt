1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Okay, good evening everybody.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,840
 Hope you're doing well at home, staying safe.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,840
 And welcome to KFCI, our recording tonight for our sermon.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,720
 Before we begin, there's a couple of announcements.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,280
 The first is we're collecting new face masks.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,640
 So if you have any spare face masks at home

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,240
 that you have too much of,

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,040
 please drop them off at reception.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,800
 And we would love to get your help

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,480
 as we wanna help the community around us.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,560
 Also, Pastor Paul and others are organizing an outreach

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,520
 to distribute these masks.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,280
 And if you are interested, please sign up

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,360
 and click the QR code, scan the QR code,

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,460
 and you'll have more information on that.

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,640
 And the next announcement is about giving.

17
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,520
 So if you're interested in giving to the church,

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,280
 there's an FPS option,

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,160
 and you can just follow the instructions

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,880
 on this slide for that.

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:05,980
 And lastly, we wanna continue to promote the One Campaign.

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,260
 And it's a great app that you can download,

23
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,400
 and you can just follow us

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,760
 as we continue to read the word of God

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,580
 and as we lead it towards Easter.

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,880
 So we're gonna pray, and we're gonna start today,

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,720
 and we're gonna continue in Ephesians.

28
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,360
 Heavenly Father, may you bless us tonight

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,280
 as we dig into your word, speak to us,

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,520
 fill us with your spirit.

31
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,720
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,520
 So we're talking about Ephesians,

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,960
 and today we're talking about adopted,

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,880
 I am adopted and loved.

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,840
 And last week, Pastor John did a great job

36
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,280
 of teaching us that we are new.

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
 We are new in Christ.

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,440
 Before we were fallen, right?

39
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,200
 We had a fallen nature.

40
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,960
 We were religious.

41
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,420
 We assumed that we were good enough.

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,220
 We worked very hard at social causes to help others

43
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,280
 to hopefully we can gain our way to become good.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,960
 We try to change ourselves through self-help insight.

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,440
 And we also try hard at keeping rules, right?

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,500
 We're very religious.

47
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,240
 We're trying to be good, trying to look good,

48
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,640
 trying to help others to become good,

49
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,960
 make ourselves feel better.

50
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,880
 And then in Christ, so we were fallen before,

51
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,720
 but in Christ now we have justification for ourselves,

52
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,560
 for our sins.

53
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,240
 We are now justified, right?

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,800
 We have regeneration.

55
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,540
 We are made new in Christ.

56
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,800
 We are a new creation.

57
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,920
 The old has gone, the new has come.

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,920
 And everything that we do is pointing towards glorification

59
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,120
 and glorification, and that is to glorify God.

60
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,240
 And so today we're talking about being adopted and loved,

61
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,760
 adopted and loved.

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,880
 Throughout this book of Ephesians,

63
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,120
 there's this continuous theme

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,200
 that we are children of God, right?

65
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,120
 And we see that in Ephesians 1, verse four.

66
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,240
 For he chose us in him before the creation of the world

67
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,020
 to be holy and blameless in his sight.

68
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,020
 In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,800
 through Jesus Christ in accordance

70
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,620
 with his pleasure and will.

71
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,620
 In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship

72
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,020
 through Jesus Christ in accordance

73
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,520
 with his pleasure and will.

74
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,920
 Adoption is such a beautiful thing, right?

75
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,920
 You have a loving couple, you know, parents, right?

76
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,720
 And then there are children that may have been,

77
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,360
 you know, orphans or whatnot in different countries.

78
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,360
 And it's such an amazing thing of gathering broken people,

79
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,680
 right, these children may have came up

80
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,120
 in broken families or situations,

81
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,400
 and they're brought into a loving family.

82
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,200
 Adoption is such a beautiful picture.

83
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,840
 But there is such a big problem of orphanism in the world.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,240
 In 2015, there were, according to one of the stats,

85
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,120
 140 million orphans in the world.

86
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,160
 And that is, orphans, according to that stat,

87
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,860
 is one who has lost one parent.

88
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:34,000
 Double orphans are those who have lost both parents

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,520
 and make up 15.1 million.

90
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800
 15.1 million, that's bigger than some

91
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,280
 of the countries in this world.

92
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,420
 Orphanism is a huge problem.

93
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,460
 Fatherlessness is also a huge problem,

94
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,800
 and we see this through David Blankenhorn.

95
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,120
 Tonight, about 40% of children in the Western world

96
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,240
 will go to sleep in homes in which

97
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,980
 their fathers do not live.

98
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,220
 Before they reach the age of 18,

99
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,400
 more than half of our nation's children

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,140
 are likely to spend at least a significant portion

101
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,840
 of their childhoods living apart from their fathers.

102
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,600
 Never before in this country have so many children

103
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,420
 been voluntarily abandoned by their fathers.

104
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,340
 Never before have so many children grown up

105
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,800
 without knowing what it means to have a father.

106
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,800
 Fatherlessness is the most harmful demographic trend

107
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,780
 in this generation, of this generation.

108
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,620
 It is the leading cause of declining child

109
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,720
 and adult well-being in our society.

110
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,040
 It is also the engine driving

111
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,560
 the most urgent social problems.

112
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,280
 If this trend continues, fatherlessness is likely

113
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,740
 to change the shape of our society.

114
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,320
 Orphans.

115
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,160
 Fatherlessness is one of the biggest problems

116
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,520
 in our modern day society.

117
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,480
 And it was also a problem back then.

118
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,160
 In fact, back then, in biblical times,

119
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,860
 only 50% of the children that were born

120
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,420
 grew up to 50 years old or more.

121
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,220
 And inficide was also a very big problem,

122
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,220
 especially for those who were disabled and girls.

123
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,980
 Inficide was a big problem.

124
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,860
 However, Christians at that time started to adopt kids.

125
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,300
 They started to adopt kids,

126
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,140
 not to build up their family status

127
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,940
 or to continue their family line,

128
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,100
 but they wanted to adopt children

129
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,100
 because they realized that they too were adopted.

130
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,480
 And Paul speaks about this in Ephesians

131
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,700
 and the rest of his letters about adoption.

132
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,180
 And we're gonna learn three things about adoption today,

133
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,260
 that in adoption, we have a new family,

134
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:21,240
 we have a new identity, and we have a new inheritance.

135
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,280
 And the first thing we learn

136
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,240
 is that we have a new family, right?

137
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,540
 Adoption is a legal thing.

138
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,460
 It's a legal thing.

139
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,620
 There's a change in name.

140
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,540
 And it was initiated by the father,

141
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,260
 purchased through Jesus Christ.

142
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,500
 And we see this in Galatians 4, verse four to five,

143
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,340
 that when the set time had fully come,

144
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,540
 God sent his son, born of a woman,

145
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,640
 born under the law to redeem those under the law,

146
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,200
 that we might receive adoption to sonship.

147
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,660
 God initiated it, right?

148
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,180
 He sent his son.

149
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,740
 He sent his son to do what?

150
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,260
 To redeem us, to redeem those under the law.

151
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,620
 Under the law, we deserve punishment.

152
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,940
 But through Jesus Christ,

153
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,280
 we have received adoption to sonship.

154
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,220
 And so we have a new family.

155
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,020
 This new family was initiated through the father.

156
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,700
 It comes through Jesus Christ.

157
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,520
 And now we have new brothers and sisters in Christ as well.

158
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,020
 We have a new family.

159
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,620
 In adoption, we also have a new identity.

160
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,840
 Before, we were rejected, right?

161
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,180
 We were sinners.

162
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,500
 We were split apart from the Lord.

163
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,980
 But now we are reborn.

164
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,980
 We are redeemed, and we are remade children in Christ.

165
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,280
 Before, in Romans, it talks about we were slaves to sin.

166
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,340
 But now we are free to be servants of righteousness.

167
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,480
 And in John 1, it says this,

168
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,320
 yet to all who receive him,

169
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,240
 to those who believed in his name,

170
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,420
 he gave the right to become children of God,

171
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,000
 children not born of natural descent,

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,960
 nor of human decision or husband's will,

173
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,120
 but born of God.

174
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,380
 If you have confessed Jesus to be the Lord and Savior

175
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,900
 and believed in his name,

176
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,900
 he has made you a child of God,

177
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,600
 a child of God.

178
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,480
 So we have a new family.

179
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,060
 We have a new identity.

180
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,060
 We're no longer just ourselves, our old selves,

181
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,720
 but we are our new selves, which is in Christ.

182
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,860
 We are Christians, followers of Christ,

183
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,260
 children of Christ.

184
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,220
 We have a new identity.

185
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,620
 And lastly, we have a new inheritance.

186
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,860
 And it says this in Romans chapter eight.

187
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,300
 For those who are led by the Spirit of God

188
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,180
 are the children of God.

189
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,740
 The Spirit you received does not make you slaves

190
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,700
 so that you live in fear again.

191
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,740
 Rather, the Spirit received brought about your adoption

192
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,900
 to sonship, and by him we cry, "Ava, Father."

193
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,020
 The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit

194
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,000
 that we are God's children.

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,060
 Now, if we are children, then we are heirs,

196
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,740
 heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.

197
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,940
 If indeed we share in his suffering,

198
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:44,560
 in order that we may also share in his glory.

199
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,100
 If we are children, it says here, we are also heirs,

200
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,260
 heirs with God and co-heirs with Christ.

201
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,540
 Isn't it amazing that we share in the inheritance

202
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,760
 with Christ?

203
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,040
 One day we'll share in this resurrected form,

204
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,740
 resurrected body, the new heaven and the new earth,

205
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,540
 all that time that we'll spend in heaven.

206
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,780
 Those are the things that we'll inherit with Christ,

207
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,740
 this new heaven and new earth.

208
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,140
 And so the thing is, if we are children of God,

209
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,260
 if we are adopted into his family,

210
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,980
 and we have a new identity,

211
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:40,180
 we have a new family, a new identity,

212
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,600
 and we have a new inheritance,

213
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,020
 the question is, are we acting like sons

214
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,080
 and daughters of God?

215
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,080
 Are we acting like sons and daughters?

216
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,600
 Being adopted children of God means transformation

217
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,680
 in our behavior, obeying our father,

218
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,160
 and living a life imitating Jesus.

219
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,160
 And that is why Paul in chapter five of Ephesians says,

220
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,160
 therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children.

221
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,720
 He tells us, be imitators, right?

222
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,720
 You're loved, you're children of God, so imitate God.

223
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:32,060
 Walk in his love, right, as Christ loved us

224
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,540
 and gave himself up for us.

225
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,200
 He also instructs us how to become sons and daughters

226
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,640
 in verse 15 to 17.

227
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,080
 Look carefully how you walk, not as unwise,

228
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,360
 but as wise, making the best use of time.

229
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,000
 As sons and daughters, we're to imitate God.

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,160
 We're to walk in his love.

231
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,180
 We're to make the best use of our time, to be wise.

232
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,320
 He tells us also in verse 18,

233
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,080
 and do not get drunk with wine, which leads to debauchery.

234
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,140
 Be filled with the Spirit.

235
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:16,720
 Adopted sons and daughters are filled with the Spirit.

236
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,240
 Continuously filled with the Spirit.

237
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:28,920
 Sons and daughters of God are imitators of God

238
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,800
 who walk in his love.

239
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,860
 Now, the last couple weeks,

240
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,920
 we've been talking about Asian culture, right?

241
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,420
 And Pastor James did a really great talk

242
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,060
 on Chinese New Year about the differences

243
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,020
 between the Western and the Eastern societies.

244
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,720
 You know, in Western society, they tell you,

245
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,900
 "Oh, I love you," right?

246
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,600
 "As a child, I love you."

247
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
 And in Eastern society, right,

248
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,840
 they give you an education, they give you food on the table,

249
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,380
 they give you those kind of things.

250
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,840
 And the problem with that is sometimes

251
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:14,400
 we get into this habit of trying to gain,

252
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,160
 trying to gain respect,

253
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,020
 trying to continuously gain that favor, right?

254
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,880
 And I myself am like that.

255
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,360
 I'm a doer.

256
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,640
 And sometimes I get caught up in this thinking

257
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,600
 that the more I do, the more God will be pleased with me,

258
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,140
 the more my dad will be pleased with me,

259
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,720
 the more things I do, the more good I am, right?

260
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,220
 And John sort of talked about that last week, right?

261
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,040
 That our fallen nature, we're trying to be good,

262
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,600
 we're trying to live up to the social standards,

263
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,180
 we're trying to do this and that

264
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,920
 to make ourselves look good.

265
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:08,160
 And the thing is, if we're adopted children,

266
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,720
 and we know that we are adopted children,

267
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,800
 we should be secure in our identity in Christ.

268
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,960
 That we are adopted.

269
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
 We are children of God.

270
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,540
 We don't need to go out there to gain our salvation,

271
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,420
 to gain God's favor.

272
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,060
 God already loves us.

273
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,320
 No matter how much more we do,

274
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,700
 God, it will not change how God loves us

275
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,320
 or what he thinks about us.

276
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,940
 And that's the thing, it's faith versus works.

277
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,660
 Faith versus works.

278
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:52,820
 We need to believe that we are children of God.

279
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,360
 Adopted children of God.

280
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,660
 So, so that we're not just going out there

281
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,300
 trying to gain our salvation.

282
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,900
 We're not serving in church just to be good enough

283
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,260
 so that God will help us.

284
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,540
 No, that's what's different about Christianity.

285
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,940
 In all religions of the world,

286
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,960
 we have to depend on ourselves to do something

287
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,840
 so that the supreme being will be pleased

288
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,840
 so that we can gain ourselves into heaven.

289
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,840
 Only in Christianity has Christ already paid for everything.

290
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,160
 And that now we have a new identity.

291
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,080
 And so we're not trying to do things

292
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,080
 to become sons and daughters of God.

293
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,020
 We already are sons and daughters of God.

294
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,860
 And so we don't come to worship here

295
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:52,740
 because, oh, I need to have good favor with God

296
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,600
 so that he'll love me and hopefully send me to heaven.

297
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,540
 No, we are children of God.

298
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,980
 We are worshipers.

299
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,780
 That's what we do.

300
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,480
 There's a change of mindset.

301
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,480
 And so instead of going out there and helping people

302
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,720
 because, oh, I need to gain favor and gain favor with God

303
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,680
 and hopefully he'll love me.

304
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,000
 No, we go out there

305
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,200
 because we're adopted sons and daughters.

306
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,520
 That's what we do.

307
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,840
 We imitate God.

308
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,040
 God goes out to help.

309
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,580
 And so that's what we do.

310
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:30,960
 We're sons and daughters.

311
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,000
 We are worshipers.

312
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,900
 We are servants.

313
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,640
 Right?

314
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,500
 We're not going out there

315
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,500
 just to gain favor of God and men.

316
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,980
 But we go out there

317
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:53,520
 because we're servants and worshipers and imitators of God.

318
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,780
 One of the best examples I've seen of this is Jeremy Lynn.

319
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,020
 Now he won his first championship with the Toronto Raptors,

320
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,460
 and I'm very proud to say.

321
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,340
 And do you know how much time he spent playing

322
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,360
 during the NBA finals?

323
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,060
 Not more than a minute, right?

324
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,980
 Something like that.

325
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,660
 Around, he played a minute,

326
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:20,900
 and yet he was considered a championship.

327
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,740
 And he was questioning himself.

328
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,580
 He was like, "Am I really a champion?"

329
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,420
 Right?

330
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,100
 Like, I've only played like a minute or whatever

331
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,620
 of garbage time in the NBA finals.

332
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,260
 And the NBA is such a place

333
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,680
 that looks at your stats, your performance.

334
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,100
 'Cause your performance is everything.

335
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,940
 Right?

336
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,420
 If you're performing, then you get playing time,

337
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,460
 and you get playing time, then you get that contract,

338
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,320
 and then you get the recognition.

339
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,700
 But Jeremy Lynn says this,

340
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,700
 "Even though I only played a million and a half

341
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,040
 "or whatever he played,

342
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,520
 "I'm still a champion.

343
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,580
 "'Cause I practiced with the team.

344
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,040
 "I worked hard with the team.

345
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,780
 "I was there all the time with the team.

346
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,680
 "I was a part of the team."

347
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:20,980
 And it's such a great picture of God's grace, I think.

348
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,580
 That, you know, we...

349
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:32,240
 God's grace is that we actually didn't really do much,

350
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,360
 but yet God did everything to save us

351
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,000
 and adopt us into his family,

352
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 and that we are champions because of what he has done.

353
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,080
 What he has done.

354
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,640
 And Jeremy Lynn does a really good job

355
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,760
 of going into his profession,

356
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,500
 believing that he is first a son and a daughter.

357
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,040
 A son, not a daughter.

358
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,600
 (laughs)

359
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,440
 Only a son.

360
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,320
 He does a great job of that,

361
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,600
 'cause it's so easy to just get caught up

362
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,760
 in your performance, look at your own stats,

363
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,720
 look how much playing time you have,

364
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,540
 and be so discouraged.

365
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:22,460
 And that off-season after he won the NBA championship,

366
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,640
 he said it's like the NBA has given up on him,

367
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,380
 and he had to go over to China to play.

368
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,020
 And so, are we acting as sons and daughters?

369
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:41,700
 Do you believe that you are a son and a daughter of God?

370
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:48,100
 'Cause if you do, you're gonna be different.

371
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,820
 You're gonna act differently.

372
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,900
 You're no longer slaves to sin,

373
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,220
 but you're now free to follow Jesus,

374
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,880
 imitate Jesus, to walk in his love.

375
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
 To live as wise.

376
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,440
 Are you acting like adopted sons and daughters?

377
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:15,120
 The second thing we're gonna look at is I am loved.

378
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,340
 I am loved.

379
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,440
 Now, everybody wants to be loved, right?

380
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,280
 Who doesn't wanna be loved?

381
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,640
 Everybody wants to be loved.

382
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,000
 And there's this great picture here

383
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 of this girl, and she's trying to catch love, right?

384
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,220
 Trying to catch love.

385
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,640
 And there's all these sorts of people in our society, right?

386
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,160
 You know them.

387
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,560
 Sometimes we are them.

388
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,920
 We're just trying to get love, right?

389
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,040
 And sometimes we go from relationship to relationship,

390
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,760
 or friendship to friendship.

391
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,320
 We're just trying to feel loved.

392
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,300
 Get that intimacy.

393
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,400
 Or people just like let people run over them, right?

394
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,240
 Because they wanna be loved by people,

395
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,680
 and so they just do whatever people tell them to do

396
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,080
 so that they feel loved.

397
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,920
 And the problem with that is we're trying to fill our heart

398
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,840
 with love, with things that will never

399
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,620
 really truly satisfy.

400
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,160
 And Pascal says this, "There is a God-shaped vacuum

401
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,000
 "in every heart."

402
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,500
 There's a God-shaped vacuum in every heart.

403
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:39,100
 Agape love, many people say, is God's love.

404
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,640
 It's divine, active, unconditional,

405
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,260
 self-sacrificing, thoughtful love.

406
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,920
 That is agape love.

407
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,880
 And we're gonna learn about Christ's love for the church

408
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,800
 in the rest of chapter five here.

409
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,800
 So read with me chapter five, verse 22.

410
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,900
 "Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord,

411
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,760
 "for the husband is the head of the wife,

412
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,000
 "even as Christ is the head of the church,

413
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,360
 "his body of the church, his body,

414
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,420
 "and is himself its savior.

415
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,580
 "Now as the church submits to Christ,

416
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,740
 "so also wives should submit in everything

417
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,700
 "to their husbands.

418
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,380
 "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church

419
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,680
 "and gave himself up for her,

420
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,760
 "that he might sanctify her,

421
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,500
 "having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,

422
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,140
 "so that he might present the church to himself in splendor,

423
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,060
 "without spot or wrinkle or any such thing,

424
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,140
 "that she might be holy and without blemish.

425
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,480
 "In the same way, husbands should love their wives

426
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,300
 "as their own bodies.

427
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,640
 "He who loves his wife loves himself,

428
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,740
 "for no one ever hated his own flesh,

429
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,400
 "but nourishes and cherishes it,

430
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,620
 "just as Christ does the church,

431
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,500
 "because we are members of his body.

432
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,480
 "Therefore, a man should leave his father and mother,"

433
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,040
 not leave his wife,

434
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,700
 "Therefore, a man should leave his father and mother

435
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,960
 "and hold fast to his wife,

436
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,160
 "and the two shall become one flesh.

437
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,080
 "This mystery is profound,

438
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,100
 "and I am saying this,

439
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,920
 "that it refers to Christ and the church.

440
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,680
 "However, let each one of you love his wife as himself,

441
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,240
 "and let his wife see that she respects her husband."

442
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,880
 Right here in chapter five,

443
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,880
 we get a great imagery of what it means

444
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,460
 that Christ loves the church,

445
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,360
 and how a husband should love his wife.

446
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,920
 And here are five ways that Jesus loved the church.

447
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,760
 And the first thing that we see

448
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,760
 is that Jesus loved the church as the head, as the head.

449
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,380
 It said, right,

450
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,600
 "For the husband is the head of the wife,

451
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,840
 "even as Christ is the head of the church,

452
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,720
 "his body, and is himself its savior."

453
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,320
 What Jesus did was he took responsibility,

454
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,600
 took responsibility as the head of the church.

455
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,520
 And because we are sinners,

456
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,520
 he took the responsibility of our sin upon himself.

457
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,360
 And so the second thing we see

458
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,920
 is that Jesus is our savior, right?

459
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,920
 Jesus himself gave himself up to save us

460
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,160
 from the problem of sin.

461
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,860
 And we see that in the next slide,

462
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,760
 that Christ is the gap, he's the bridge.

463
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,000
 He died on the cross once and for all,

464
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 so that this problem of sin would no longer be there,

465
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,580
 so that we could be reunited with our Father.

466
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,040
 Christ is the giver.

467
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,240
 He gave himself up.

468
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,440
 He gave up his body for the church.

469
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,680
 He gave it for us.

470
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:33,740
 And next, we see that he is the sanctifier and cleanser,

471
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,560
 sanctifier and cleanser.

472
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,360
 Jesus sanctifies us with his blood.

473
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,960
 He washes us clean.

474
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,960
 All right, he's trying to make us more and more like himself

475
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,560
 to become more and more like the Father.

476
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,840
 He is also the nourisher and cherisher, right?

477
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,140
 Just like in verse 29, it says,

478
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,920
 "For no one ever hated his own flesh,

479
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,760
 "but nourishes and cherishes it,"

480
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,240
 just as Christ does the church

481
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,120
 because we are members of his body.

482
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,720
 Christ cherishes the church and nourishes the church.

483
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,720
 These are the five ways that Christ loves the church.

484
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,760
 He's seeking for us to become more and more holy, right?

485
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,280
 He's nourishing us, sanctifying us,

486
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:38,000
 changing us so that we become more and more like him.

487
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 So we repent of our sins.

488
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,640
 We stop following the ways of our flesh,

489
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,800
 but now we are free to follow,

490
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,380
 follow Jesus.

491
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,520
 And so how Christ loves the church is the same way

492
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,680
 how Paul says that husbands should love their wives.

493
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,080
 Husbands should love their wives as Jesus loved the church.

494
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,080
 Husbands should cherish their wives,

495
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,120
 love their wives,

496
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:24,080
 and wives should submit to their husbands

497
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,680
 as the church submits to Jesus.

498
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,800
 Do you recognize how loved you are?

499
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,040
 You're so loved that God,

500
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,040
 you're so loved that God took responsibility

501
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,920
 of the punishment that you and I deserve,

502
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:48,680
 died on the cross for us, gave up his life for us.

503
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,960
 He loves the church so much.

504
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,960
 You are so loved because you are members of God's church.

505
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,480
 And so the question is,

506
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,080
 are you acting like a loved son and daughter?

507
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,560
 Are you acting like a loved son and daughter?

508
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,320
 Or are you going out in the world,

509
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,040
 trying to fill your heart with things

510
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:24,640
 that will never satisfy, that will never satisfy?

511
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,760
 If you're acting like a loved son and daughter,

512
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,120
 you're no longer slaves to seeking love from all directions.

513
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,640
 But now you know you're loved,

514
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,920
 and you can instead go out there

515
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,920
 and be free to love others as Jesus loves them.

516
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:57,320
 One of the youth, he grew up,

517
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,240
 he grew up with his parents

518
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,240
 telling him about the 10 commandments

519
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,160
 every night almost, and God's judgment.

520
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:11,360
 And so he has this mindset

521
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,320
 that he always deserves punishment,

522
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,000
 that God is a God of wrath, right?

523
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,720
 God will punish you.

524
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,680
 And so he grew up like that in our church.

525
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:30,040
 And it was hard for him to recognize

526
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,400
 that God was a loving father.

527
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,160
 There was this one time we went hiking actually,

528
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
 and we were sitting together.

529
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,840
 And he was like, "Johnny, I'm so mad at God.

530
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,520
 "I'm so mad at God.

531
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,360
 "I deserve punishment."

532
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,360
 And he even said, "If God wants to punish me so bad,

533
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,600
 "He can just strike me down right now."

534
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,560
 And I'm just like, "Yo, buddy, just relax, man.

535
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,080
 "God loves you."

536
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,160
 And we went through some scripture.

537
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,680
 Actually, before, he only read the Old Testament

538
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,800
 'cause he was like, "Yeah, God is a God of wrath

539
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,400
 "and judgment."

540
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,480
 And so we started looking into the New Testament

541
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,240
 and who Jesus actually is.

542
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,720
 And actually, in the Old Testament,

543
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,080
 it also talks about God is love, right?

544
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,200
 But he only chose to read those parts

545
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,440
 of condemnation and judgment.

546
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,280
 And so as we started to look more and more

547
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,960
 through the New Testament and the Old Testament as well,

548
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,520
 to get a full picture of redemption,

549
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,160
 God's plan of redemption.

550
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,200
 God softened his heart.

551
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,280
 And God helped him to realize

552
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:59,720
 that he's not just a punishment, wrathful God,

553
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,920
 that he is also a loving God.

554
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,260
 He's just and he's love at the same time.

555
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,840
 And so once he started to realize that,

556
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,480
 "Wow, God is love.

557
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,100
 "God sent Jesus 'cause he loves us so much

558
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,020
 "to bring us back to him."

559
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,120
 Then he was able to start loving others.

560
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,960
 Before he was also very quick to condemn and judge others.

561
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,920
 Right, he was like, "Oh, these people are bad.

562
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,780
 "They deserve to be punished."

563
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:39,480
 And he's so loving now.

564
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,400
 In fact, he joined one of these non-Christian groups

565
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,700
 and he's trying to reach them.

566
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,260
 He joined some non-Christian group

567
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,700
 and he's praying for them and getting to know them

568
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,100
 and really trying to share God's love with them.

569
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,980
 This is a story of a kid

570
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,740
 who didn't understand that he was loved.

571
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,000
 And so he couldn't go out and love others.

572
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,440
 That once he recognized that he was a loved son,

573
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,380
 he was able to go out and love others

574
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,380
 and share love of others, love of God to others.

575
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,400
 And that's what we're doing here at this church as well

576
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,720
 through this outreach.

577
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,040
 We wanna reach out to our community.

578
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,340
 Those who don't have masks, we wanna supply it to them.

579
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,980
 We wanna go out in the love of Christ.

580
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,020
 And that's something that we can all join in.

581
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,800
 We can all join in.

582
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,160
 And so to conclude, here are some application points.

583
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:57,160
 The first is, have you been adopted as a son and daughter?

584
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,840
 Have you been adopted as a son and daughter?

585
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,120
 Do you recognize that you are a child of God?

586
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,580
 If you haven't confessed Jesus to be the Lord

587
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,220
 and Savior of your life, you can do that.

588
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,280
 You can do that tonight.

589
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,160
 And ask Jesus into your life to be a Lord and Savior

590
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,580
 and to become a child of God.

591
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:28,680
 The second thing is, do you recognize the love of God?

592
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,600
 God loves you so much that he's willing to die for you.

593
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,560
 God sent him to die on the cross for our sins,

594
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,580
 the punishment that we deserve.

595
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,020
 Do you recognize how much God loves you?

596
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,740
 You are loved and you are adopted.

597
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:55,660
 And if you are loved and adopted,

598
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,660
 are you acting like adopted, loved sons and daughters of God?

599
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:10,100
 You know, we're in a society right now with so much fear,

600
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,820
 fear of this virus that is going on.

601
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:19,620
 But God did not give us a spirit of fear,

602
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,520
 he gave us a spirit of power, of love.

603
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,900
 Can we go out there and be his love?

604
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,080
 Share the hope of Jesus Christ.

605
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,580
 People need the message of hope

606
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,400
 of the love of Jesus Christ more than ever.

607
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,280
 In a time of fear, in time of hopelessness,

608
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,640
 can we be his light?

609
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,360
 Go out and shine forth, be a city on the hill.

610
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,880
 And the fourth thing is, are we reaching out

611
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,920
 with the love of God?

612
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,000
 Are we reaching out with the love of God?

613
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,680
 How did Jesus reach out?

614
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,240
 He touched the leper.

615
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,740
 He spent time with the tax collectors.

616
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:15,780
 He had compassion upon those who are poor.

617
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,720
 Can we go out with the love of Christ?

618
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,360
 Because we know we are loved ourselves.

619
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,160
 We're not out there to try and gain God's favor

620
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,920
 and gain, you know, make ourselves feel good.

621
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,680
 No, we are already loved.

622
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,120
 We are already loved children of God.

623
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,560
 Can we go out there and be the hands and feet of Jesus?

624
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:43,700
 And I encourage you to join this outreach.

625
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,120
 Pray for the people in our city

626
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:54,020
 that God would heal our city and help us.

627
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,640
 So let's pray.

628
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,720
 Heavenly Father, we thank you

629
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,760
 that through your word you remind us

630
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,800
 that we are adopted and that we are loved.

631
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,800
 Help us to go out as your adopted sons and daughters

632
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,420
 to shine forth your light and your love

633
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,880
 to our city and to the rest of the world.

634
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,520
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

635
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:29,520
