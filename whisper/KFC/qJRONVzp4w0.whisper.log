[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   Thank you so much, Pastor John, and it's amazing to see all of you.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.760]   I'm glad all you are healthy and Hong Kong is looking strong and we're so excited to
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.480]   continue this series, Mark My Word.
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.840]   Today, the word is blessed, blessed.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.800]   And so I want you to type in your chat what comes to mind when you hear this word blessed
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.000]   as you see in the next slide.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.760]   What comes to mind in what comes to mind when you see this word blessed?
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.600]   Is it blessings of blessing?
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.800]   I'm blessed because what comes to mind when you hear this word blessed?
[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.800]   God?
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.000]   Yes, God is blessed.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.160]   Grace.
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.680]   Blessed is the name of the Lord.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.680]   Very good.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.720]   What about others?
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720]   Any others?
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.720]   Happy?
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.280]   If you're blessed, you should be happy, I guess.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280]   Very good.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.760]   The Beatitudes, protected, being protected by God, protection from Him.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.760]   That's excellent.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:14.760]   Very good.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.760]   Persecution.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.760]   Yes.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.160]   I mean, in the Beatitudes, it says, "Blessed are those who persecute you," right?
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.040]   "For your reward will be in heaven."
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.040]   Absolutely.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.040]   Inheritance.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.040]   Very good.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.120]   It is good to give as well as to receive.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.120]   Very good.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   Excellent.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.880]   And as Pastor John said earlier, Palm Sunday is the start of the Holy Week for Christians,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.560]   and that is Jesus' approach towards Jerusalem, and then finally, towards His death and His
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.840]   resurrection.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   And for Jews, it is the celebration of Passover.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.160]   And we're going to take a look at the film.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.920]   It's been amazing to have the film with us and just having live just examples of what
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.000]   Jesus did, what He spoke.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.600]   And so, Bonnie, take it away.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.440]   Let's see the video.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.320]   As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.080]   sent two of His disciples, saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.200]   as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.780]   Untie it and bring it here.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.560]   If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?'
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.000]   say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.060]   They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway.
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.480]   As they untied it, some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.480]   colt?"
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:03.040]   They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.960]   When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, He sat on it.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.440]   Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.320]   in the fields.
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.680]   Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna!
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.080]   Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.600]   Blessed is the coming kingdom of our Father David!
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:41.600]   Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.000]   Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.120]   He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, He went out to Bethany
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:02.240]   with the twelve.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.200]   All right, what an excellent clip.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.760]   And so, we see here that Jesus was approaching Jerusalem.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.760]   Now, we know from the other gospel passages that Jesus had been to Jerusalem before, right?
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.020]   Just like any good Jew, they would go to the temple and continue to have different rituals
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.800]   and different festivals.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.960]   And so, this wasn't the first time Jesus entered Jerusalem, that this was possibly, or we know,
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.760]   that it is His final time to Jerusalem before His death and resurrection.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.240]   And so, it's very interesting here.
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.440]   We see that Jesus enters Bethany and goes to the Mount, at the Mountain of Olives, and
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.280]   He tells the disciples to go and find a colt, right?
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:55.040]   So, it could be a young donkey or a young horse, and He told them to bring it to Him
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.880]   because the Lord needs it.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.760]   And it's very funny here.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.280]   When do we ever see Jesus say that He needs something?
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.800]   Or maybe the Lord is referring to God, or some people could say it could be God or it
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.080]   could be Jesus, but when does He ever say that God needs something?
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.200]   It is very interesting here to point out.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.440]   And so, we see sort of the map of Jerusalem here.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.720]   We see in the next slide that He's going through Bethany and Beth-ayahsh towards Jerusalem.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.080]   And so, this is around, the Mount of Olives is around 826 meters above sea level.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.160]   Jerusalem is 785 meters above sea level.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:51.680]   So, it's not a huge mountain, it's a little hill, possibly the size of, probably shorter
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.800]   than Lion's Rock here, right?
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:01.120]   Jesus is sort of on the mountain and He's about to descend, and that is when we see
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.800]   His triumphant entry into Jerusalem.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.400]   And so, we're going to see four things here about the blessed Messiah tonight.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.720]   The first thing is that we are blessed by His presence.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   We are blessed by His peace.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.480]   We are blessed when we praise Him.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.400]   We are blessed by His purpose.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.760]   And so, first of all, we are blessed by His presence.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.280]   And so, when somebody amazing comes into the room, when somebody of power, or when Pastor
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.800]   John comes into the room, the room comes alive, right?
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.000]   There's instant chatter, there's instant excitement in the room, right?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.400]   And so, we are blessed in the presence of a King that is coming.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.920]   And when Jesus comes, He's coming in humility.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:01.440]   He's coming in a donkey, or a small colt, or a small horse, right?
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.680]   He comes as a servant King.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:10.240]   He's not coming to just be served and to be praised, but He's coming to seek and to save
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   and to serve.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.720]   He is a servant King.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:20.440]   And it says, and it was prophesied in Zechariah 9, verse 9, "Behold, your King is coming to
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   you.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:29.160]   Righteous and having salvation is He, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   of a donkey."
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.640]   And so, it was prophesied in the Old Testament that Jesus would come, and that He would come
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.600]   as a King on a donkey.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.880]   And it's also interesting that in the Old Testament, He's not the only King that rides
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.640]   into Jerusalem, or rides as a King on a mule or a donkey.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:55.320]   King Solomon also did that in the Old Testament.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.680]   And so, firstly, we are blessed by His presence.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:07.560]   The presence of this King is humility, a servant King, willing to obey God, God's will, the
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:13.400]   Father's will, to the point of death towards the cross.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:20.760]   And so, I remember when I went on the ski trip to Japan, and I went with all these,
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.360]   you know, CEOs, executives, doctors, business owners, and I was like, "Whoa."
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:30.120]   I was in this room and having dinner with them, and I was like, "Whoa, these guys are
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.440]   all, you know, probably millionaires or really rich people."
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.200]   And I was like, "I don't belong in this room," right?
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.360]   But then, they spoke to me.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.520]   They looked me into the eye.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.440]   They asked about me.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.680]   They cared for me.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:55.000]   And so, I felt the humility of these people who were rich, who were, you know, high class,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.480]   who were, you know, big rollers, right?
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.520]   That these people had humility.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.600]   And that is sort of like Jesus.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:11.880]   Jesus, He is enthroned in heaven, and yet He is willing to come and eat with us and
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:19.000]   be among us, a people that is sinner and don't deserve His presence.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.480]   But that is Jesus, that we are blessed by His humility, His servant heart.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.760]   In His presence, we are blessed.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:36.840]   And next, we see that the Jews, they were also expecting something from this Messiah,
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.320]   right?
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.160]   They expected a Messiah to be coming on a war horse.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.600]   They were expecting Him to be proud, right?
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.160]   Chin up, right?
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.400]   Everybody put their chin up, you know?
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.480]   They expected, yeah, Gabe, I see you, right?
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:01.160]   They expected this King, this Messiah to be coming and saving them in physical power,
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:07.720]   mighty, amazing, that Jesus rides in, not on a mighty war horse, right?
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:15.240]   Like those crazy Roman emperors that are coming in with their whole entire armies.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.680]   No, Jesus rides in, in a colt, a baby horse, a donkey.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:26.920]   And He doesn't come with physical power, with a huge army beside Him.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.840]   He comes with His disciples, His disciples.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   And next, we see the second thing, is that we are blessed by His peace.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:45.240]   Coming on a colt, on a donkey, also symbolizes peace.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.840]   And we know that throughout the New Testament and in the Old Testament,
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.440]   Jesus is called the Prince of Peace.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:59.400]   And then in the midst of the greatest storm, He is the one that calms the storm.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.240]   He is the one that gives peace.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:12.120]   And so, Jesus also says to the disciples, "Peace I leave with you, peace I give to you,
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.200]   not as the world gives.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:17.320]   Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid."
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.120]   In the presence of Jesus, there is peace.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.360]   And we are blessed by His peace.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:33.000]   And so, these Jews, they were expecting victory, as we see in the next slide.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.160]   We were, they were expecting victory over the Romans,
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   because the Romans had been empowering them, right?
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.920]   Jews had been overthrown and overpowered for so many centuries, right?
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.240]   First, the Egyptians, and then the Persians, and then the Syrians,
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.200]   and then the Babylonians, and now the Romans.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.040]   And so, they were expecting this Messiah, this Saviour,
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:03.080]   to grant them victory over the Romans, so that they would be restored.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.120]   But Jesus came, not for peace with the Romans.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.360]   Jesus came to restore their inner peace,
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:17.160]   because their peace with God was broken because of sin.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:25.080]   And so, Jesus came for inner peace, to restore this broken relationship with God,
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:29.080]   so that they could have peace with God once again.
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.160]   And so, on the chat, I want you to write,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:39.000]   when was a time that you experienced the peace of Christ?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.600]   When have you experienced Him in the midst of all the storms of your life?
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.000]   Maybe the storms of this pandemic, not being able to travel.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:58.360]   Maybe the economic disaster, or the things that have been going on.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.720]   When have you experienced the peace of Christ in your life?
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.640]   Would you like to share?
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.480]   Every day, very good.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.440]   There are so many storms in our lives every day.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.360]   Maybe in the MTR, right?
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.360]   There's just so much, you know, it's like zombies, right?
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.440]   Travelling from one place to another.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:26.680]   And you've experienced peace in the MTR, in the midst of all these people going on.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.440]   You know, just being able to run.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.800]   Okay, being still.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.600]   Just being able to sit and be still before the Lord.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.400]   Yes, in the midst of storms.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.920]   Absolutely.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:49.400]   You know, so many people are experiencing mental illness, right?
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:54.840]   And we talked about that in our student college program.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.640]   She's been going through these things where her friend had committed suicide,
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.120]   and she was seeking the peace of God.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.800]   Yes, when you pray, you experience the peace of God.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.560]   Absolutely.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.920]   Praying is us humbling ourselves before God,
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:16.280]   and saying that, "God, we need you in this situation, in our lives."
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.920]   So, we've seen two things already.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.720]   That we've been blessed by His presence.
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.920]   We've been blessed by His peace.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.560]   We are blessed, absolutely.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.800]   We experience peace when we let Him take control, right?
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.480]   And when we surrender our lives.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.000]   Thank you, Florence, for that.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.080]   And so, we're going to see two other things.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.840]   That we are blessed as we praise Him, and we are blessed by His purpose.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.360]   And so, let's read verse 9 once again.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.800]   "Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted,
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:56.520]   'Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:00.600]   Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:07.560]   Blessed is he! Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna in the highest!'"
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.880]   And so, when there is a king, what happens?
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.000]   There are often gifts for a king.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.880]   What happens when Jesus was born?
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:26.440]   The Magi, the kings of the East, they brought frankincense, myrrh, and gold, right?
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.640]   And so, what do we bring?
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.920]   What do we bring to the king?
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.640]   We bring our praise to the king.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:43.720]   When we praise the king, there is just an amazing feeling of just worshipping Him.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:51.480]   There's an amazing feeling of being blessed as we sing songs of surrender towards Jesus,
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.280]   towards Him.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.040]   It's amazing that throughout the New Testament,
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.280]   Jesus didn't allow people to praise Him, right?
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.880]   Whenever demons said, "This is the Son of God,"
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:08.840]   or "This is Messiah," or "This is the King,"
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:15.160]   He would often tell demons to be quiet, or tell the disciples to not let people yet know
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.520]   that He is the King, or who He is.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.560]   And that is because His time had not yet come.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:27.880]   And this is the first time that He is receiving praise from the people, right?
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.120]   It's sort of like a red carpet, right?
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.000]   People are putting cloaks onto the donkey,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.520]   putting cloaks onto the floor,
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.720]   palm trees onto the floor,
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.880]   waving palm trees as well.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.080]   They're giving Jesus the praise and the glory and the gifts that He deserved.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.680]   And this is the first time we see that He allows it.
[00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.560]   And they cry, "Hosanna, Hosanna!"
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:58.600]   And that means, "Deliver us now," or "Save now," in Hebrew.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:04.920]   And it's amazing that if we do not praise this King,
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.680]   if you do not praise this King,
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.240]   in a similar version in Luke chapter 19,
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:19.720]   who also talks about the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem,
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.560]   He says that, "I tell you, if you were silent,
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.120]   "the very stones would cry out."
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:31.160]   If you don't praise Jesus, if you don't praise this King,
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.800]   even the rocks will cry out.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.720]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.320]   You know, when you're rock climbing, can you imagine?
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.080]   The rocks are praising Jesus.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.000]   Every hold, every crimp, every foothold that you have,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.960]   those footholds, those crimps, those jugs that you're holding onto,
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.080]   those rocks are praising Jesus.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:00.920]   If you don't praise Jesus, the rocks will cry out.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.000]   It's amazing.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.360]   And I shared the story of Ken earlier, right?
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.880]   As we see in the next slide, as we worship the Lord,
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.800]   and as he was worshiping the Lord late last year,
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.480]   and as he was singing about the reckless love of God,
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:21.800]   our student Ken came to know Jesus,
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.000]   and he confessed Jesus to be Lord and Savior
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.520]   when he was in a worship service, praising God.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.680]   And that's because when we praise God,
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.160]   and we give Him all the glory and honor that He deserves,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.840]   somehow we are blessed in His presence.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.560]   We are blessed as we praise God.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:46.600]   And Ken shared that he was blessed and confessed Jesus
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.240]   to be the Lord and Savior of his life
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.480]   the first time when he entered into worship of the Lord.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.320]   So we are blessed in His presence.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.880]   And the Jews, so we see that the Jews were looking
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.160]   for a proud king who would come on a war horse.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.120]   They were looking for a physically powerful king
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.280]   that would come with his armies.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.560]   He would have victory over the Romans.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.720]   He was looking for, they were looking for a king,
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.600]   a Messiah that would save them physically,
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.160]   that would bless them physically.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:28.040]   But no, Jesus came to save them,
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.480]   not just from physical sin,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:34.600]   not physically, but also spiritually.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:41.080]   Jesus came ultimately to save them from sin and death,
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.840]   and to conquer death once and for all.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:48.600]   And the last thing that we're blessed by
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.920]   is we're blessed by His purpose.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.680]   Jesus came for a specific purpose,
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.440]   and that is to seek and save that which He was lost.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.880]   He came not just to do miracles,
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.080]   not just to touch the brokenhearted,
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:11.880]   the lepers, the women at the well.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.160]   No, He came ultimately for all of us.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.640]   His purpose was to be an ultimate sacrifice,
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.800]   to be a sacrificial lamb.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:27.720]   Isn't it amazing that at the start of this Jewish Passover,
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:35.000]   and they were remembering how God had saved them from Egypt,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.960]   and they were looking to slaughter lamb,
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.240]   and the blood shed, and they were putting it at the door,
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:46.120]   blood would protect them from the angel of death,
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.320]   that Jesus came as the ultimate sacrifice,
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:57.720]   the ultimate lamb that would be dying for them on the cross once and for all.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.760]   His blood shed for you and me,
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:07.400]   so that the Lord would have peace with us once again,
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.800]   and that our relationship with Him would be restored.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:20.520]   And so, we see that the Jews were looking for restoration of Israel.
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.480]   They wanted Israel to be restored to the times of King David,
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.160]   to the grandeur of King Solomon,
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.720]   with all his riches and all his wisdom.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.720]   They wanted Israel to be at the forefront of the world,
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.240]   to be on the map again.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:42.520]   They expected this Messiah to come and restore Israel.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:50.360]   But Jesus came to restore our citizenship in heaven.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:57.000]   The Jews were looking for an earthly, a physical restoration of Israel,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.400]   but Jesus was looking for a spiritual and a heavenly restoration,
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:09.960]   making us a new creation in heaven before the Lord.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.080]   And so, the question we have to ask is,
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:20.280]   do we have the right view of the Messiah?
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.040]   Right?
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.440]   We have learned here that we have been blessed.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.120]   We have been blessed by His presence, the presence of the King.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.760]   We are blessed by the peace of the King.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:32.840]   We are blessed as we praise Him.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.280]   We are blessed because of His purpose to save us,
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.920]   to become the sacrificial lamb, to be the ultimate sacrifice for us.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:47.240]   Have you experienced the blessings that come with the King?
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.800]   And the next question we have to ask is,
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.840]   do we have the right view of the Messiah?
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:03.400]   The Jews did not see the Messiah as Jesus presented Himself, right?
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.840]   Once again, the Jews were looking for a proud,
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.880]   mighty warrior, victory over the Romans.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:15.640]   They were looking for a physical victory and a restoration of Israel to its might.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.440]   But Jesus came humble.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:24.040]   He came to restore peace, our peace with God.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.280]   He came so that we would be saved from physical,
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.560]   a spiritual damnation from our own sin and death.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:37.880]   Jesus came to restore our citizenship in heaven.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.480]   And so do we have the right view of the Messiah?
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.120]   Maybe, you know, we know of Jesus,
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:54.040]   but we haven't truly given Him all the control in our life.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.600]   Here are some questions that help us to ponder in the next slide.
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.200]   Do we truly believe that Jesus is in control?
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.920]   Just like Florence said, right, as we give up control,
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.920]   we have peace, truly peace from God.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.720]   If we truly believe that Jesus is in control and that God is sovereign over things,
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:20.760]   then why is it that we're running around trying to control everything in our life?
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:27.160]   Do we truly believe that Jesus is in control?
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.920]   Do we truly believe that Jesus has what is best for us?
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:35.160]   If we believe He has what is best for us,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.000]   then why are we trying to change everything and manipulating everything
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.080]   when we should just trust Him and ask Him to open doors for us?
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.040]   Obviously, we need to do our part.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.560]   I'm not saying do nothing.
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.400]   I'm saying we do our part, but we trust that He has best for us.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.240]   But a lot of times we're not living our lives
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.840]   like we truly believe that He has what is best for us.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.760]   I have a plan.
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.520]   My plan is the best, and we are shattered when our plan doesn't work out
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:16.120]   because it shows that we believe we have what is best for us.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:21.320]   And if we surrendered to the King, if we surrendered to the Lord,
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.720]   then we would have peace, true peace.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.960]   Are we saved by grace?
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:34.120]   Do we believe that we are saved by grace and not by works?
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:39.080]   And because I'm a doer, right, I sometimes get in this trap
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.560]   where I believe that the more I do for Jesus,
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.600]   the more I help people to come to know Jesus,
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.520]   the more people that come to know faith,
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.920]   then God would love me more.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:56.120]   I fall into that trap sometimes because I am a doer.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.760]   I think that, oh, if I help out with this fellowship
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.560]   and that fellowship and this ministry and that ministry,
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.840]   and if I do more for Jesus, then He'll love me more.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:13.960]   But that's not right because God loves me as I am, right?
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.920]   There's no way I can gain more money or gain more works
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.240]   so that God would love me more.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.880]   No, God loves us unconditionally.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.560]   And sometimes we go from relationship to relationship
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.440]   to relationship, trying to find love
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:37.720]   when we should truly believe that this Messiah
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.600]   loves us unconditionally.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.160]   We are loved.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.840]   We don't need to go around seeking love from relationship
[00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:50.680]   to relationship to relationship
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.360]   because we know that Jesus died for us.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.760]   God loves us so much that Jesus was sent by God,
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.240]   His one and only Son,
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.720]   so that we could have a restored relationship with Him.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.640]   And it's interesting how this passage ends here.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.800]   Let's look at the next verses here.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.120]   "Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts,
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.920]   and He looked around at everything,
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.040]   but since it was already late,
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:28.040]   He went out to Bethany with the twelve."
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.040]   It's interesting here
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.080]   because there's multiple accounts of this.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.360]   You know, in Matthew, what happens is Jesus arrives
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:40.120]   and they're shouting "Hosanna!"
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.880]   and they place Baham branches,
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.920]   and then what happens is that Jerusalem was stirred up.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.440]   They're like, "Who is this?
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.720]   Who is this Jesus?"
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.880]   And they're like, "Oh, Jesus, this is the prophet
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.360]   that has come," or "This is the Messiah that has come."
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.440]   There was confusion in the city.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:57.320]   That's what Matthew accounts for.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.240]   And then in the Gospel of Luke, when Jesus comes in,
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.680]   they were like, "Even the stones will rise up
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.120]   and praise the Lord."
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.640]   There was a sense of praise.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.840]   The city was stirred up to praise God.
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.000]   But here in the account of Mark,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.440]   it says that Jesus entered the temple courts,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.640]   and He looked around at everything,
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.360]   and then He went back to Bethany.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:28.440]   What's interesting here is that they were praising Jesus
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.960]   as He was entering into Jerusalem,
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.480]   but as He arrived to the temple,
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.520]   to the temple courts,
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.040]   when God arrives to the temple courts,
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.120]   where is everybody?
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.360]   Where are the priests?
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.080]   Where are the people?
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:54.200]   God Himself has arrived in the place where He,
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.920]   where this place was, the temple of heaven,
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.880]   was created for God, and God Himself has entered,
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.680]   and they do not praise Him.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.640]   Nobody's there.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.560]   Mark accounts that He went around,
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.600]   He looked around at everything, and then He left.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:24.360]   And it is as if the Jews had missed God Himself,
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.640]   Jesus in the flesh, the Word made flesh,
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.560]   as He went into the temple Himself.
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.480]   And it is a stark reminder for us
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:39.320]   that the Jews missed Jesus.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:44.200]   They made the temple for God,
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.120]   and when God, Jesus,
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.480]   Himself enters it,
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   they didn't even know He was there.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:58.200]   And so, could it be for the same for us today,
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.640]   that as we went into the church,
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:05.000]   as we go into worshipping God on Zoom here
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   or to the church physically,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.280]   have we missed Jesus?
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.000]   Maybe we don't even recognize Jesus.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   We've missed Him.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.680]   Just like the Jews,
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.240]   they didn't recognize Jesus
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.160]   as He went to the temple Himself.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.720]   And so I hope, my hope is that
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:36.040]   we recognize Jesus as we go to church,
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:41.400]   and that we know that He is our Savior.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.600]   He is God of the universe.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.280]   And that one day, it says in Revelations,
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.880]   as we see in the next slide,
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.640]   He is coming again.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.160]   I am coming soon.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   My reward is with me,
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:59.480]   and I will give to each person
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.720]   according to what they have done.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.400]   I am the Alpha and the Omega,
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.840]   the first and the last,
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.760]   the beginning and the end.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.240]   Jesus will come again.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.680]   Jesus will come again.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.600]   And this time, He will come victorious
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.720]   in power, in judgment,
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.080]   and He will come in victory.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:29.080]   And so I pray that we have not missed Jesus,
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:34.040]   that we have not misunderstood who Jesus is,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.680]   and that we have claimed Him
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.800]   to be Hosanna, our Savior, once and for all.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:45.400]   God bless you on this Palm Sunday.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.840]   May you recognize the Messiah and who He is.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:53.160]   We're going to respond now in a song called "Hosanna."
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.120]   Let's pray.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.080]   Heavenly Father, we thank You for Your presence,
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:02.040]   that we are blessed by the presence of the King.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:04.280]   We are blessed by the peace of the King.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.720]   We are blessed as we praise You.
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.960]   And as we come into worshiping You now,
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.720]   You are Hosanna in the highest.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:21.720]   May You, may You be pleased with our praises to You.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.160]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
