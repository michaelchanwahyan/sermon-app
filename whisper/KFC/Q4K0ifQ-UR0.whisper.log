[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.200]   So since this is our last sermon on this series, let me do a quick recap of what has happened
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.520]   throughout the book of Judges.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:21.480]   Now the story began with the death of Joshua, who led the Israelites into the land of Canaan
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560]   after they had wandered 40 years in the wilderness.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.960]   And God gave them victory, but they had failed to drive out the inhabitants as recorded in
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   the first chapter.
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.280]   And now we won't read through this, but I just wanted to show you how they did not drive
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.960]   out the inhabitants, did not drive out the inhabitants.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.680]   And it's repeated throughout from verse 27 all the way to 33.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.960]   And what we see is as a result, the lifestyle of the Israelites were very much affected
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.640]   by the non-believing people that were in Canaan.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.560]   And they did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.080]   And the pattern of this book has been really clear, we'll be repeating them over and over
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.160]   again, which was the people rebelled against God and they worshipped idols and they didn't
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.640]   believe in him.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.920]   And so God eventually brought judgment through the foreign oppressors.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.040]   And now they would cry out to God again, and then God would raise up a deliverer or a judge,
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.600]   and then people would eventually turn back to God, but only to find that the sin cycle
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.560]   repeats itself.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.040]   So now we see this chart, we can see that actually there were seven of these cycles
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.600]   that have happened.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.560]   And actually throughout the first three chapters, it really displayed their disobedience, their
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.680]   idolatry, and also the intermarriage that was happening.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.280]   And we see that God has actually raised up 13 judges along the way to try to help them.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.640]   Now, for example, we see Deborah who has fought against the Canaanites, and Gideon fighting
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.480]   against the Medianites, and Samson against Philistines, and so on.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.080]   So we can see that the patterns are just repeating itself.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.120]   And now we're in the last chapter, we're going to find out, has anything changed?
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.080]   I can already give you the answer, nothing has changed, but maybe even worsened.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.200]   So now, most likely, the book was not written in chronological order.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.480]   And so the chapter 17 to 21, we actually see scenarios of moral decay that most likely
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.720]   happened within the timeframe of chapter 13 to 16.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:47.760]   So and now we're looking at the last two chapters.
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.600]   And so here it begins like this in chapter 20.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:02.080]   Now the only, what we see here is that at the beginning of this chapter, we see 400,000
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.560]   Israelites getting together.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.480]   And they range from Dan all the way to Beersheba.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.680]   Now do you, does anybody recall what happened in chapter 19?
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680]   Does anybody recall?
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.240]   Let me try to see the chat box.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.640]   Okay, as you're typing, I'm going to give you a little bit of background what has happened.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.280]   Now because, remember the concubine, yes.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.680]   So we say the word concubine, it should ring a bell where there was an unnamed Levite.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   And while he was trying to get his concubine back from his father-in-law, he passed by
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.320]   this town.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.000]   And these townspeople actually came after him.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.240]   And eventually, he had to give his concubine out to them.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.240]   And they raped her until the morning and she died.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:05.320]   And eventually, he cut her, the crops out and gave it to the tribes of Israel.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.880]   So now at the beginning of chapter 20, all the tribes came and there were 400,000 men,
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.720]   except the tribe of Benjamin was not there.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:24.600]   Now because if we look at the map here, Gibeah, let me see, is it showing?
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:35.040]   Sorry, Gibeah, which is where the concubine disaster happened, was actually part of where
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.400]   Benjamin, the tribe of Benjamin was.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.240]   And they were trying to protect this tribe.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:51.040]   And so the men gathered at Mishpah, all those 400,000 men, as you can see here on the map.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.480]   And so all these men came together and they asked the Levite, "What's happening?
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.960]   Why have you given us parts of a body as a message?"
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:08.800]   And this is what he says, "And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.520]   answered him, 'I came to Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.160]   the night, and the leaders of the Gibeah rose against me and surrounded the house against
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   me by night.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.440]   They meant to kill me and they violated my concubine and she's dead.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.620]   So I took hold of my concubine, cut her into pieces and sent her throughout all the country
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.240]   of the inheritance of Israel.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.120]   And they have committed abomination and outrage."
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.800]   Now actually, according to chapter 19, the men did not want to kill him.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.400]   They only wanted to have, well, I shouldn't say only, but they wanted to have sexual relations
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   with him.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.840]   And so, and he never mentioned the fact that he was a coward and he just gave his concubine
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.640]   out to these men to save himself.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.720]   So here, he's also putting a judgment out to say that they've committed abomination
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.720]   and outrage.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:16.680]   Now, the Israelites wanted to only now punish the men of Gibeah, but because Benjamin, the
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:25.040]   tribe would not let them, and instead they prepared 26,700 fighting men that would fight
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.400]   against the 400,000 Israelites.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.880]   Okay, so that's 15 times more people, but yet the Benjamin Knights are still saying,
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.400]   we're not willing to give up the people of Gibeah.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.040]   So now they're about to go to war.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.920]   Now before going up, they asked the Lord, "Who of us shall go first against the Benjamin
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   Knights?"
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   All right?
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.520]   And that was the first time they asked.
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.520]   And God's response was, "Judah shall go first."
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.800]   All right, now my question to you is, what do you think the result is?
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.240]   Did the men of Israel win or did the Benjamin Knights?
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:10.720]   Can you type it in the chat box?
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.720]   Israel lost.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.720]   Okay?
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.960]   The Benjamin, okay, so Benjamin won.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:23.520]   All right, I can see that the people who are answering that the Benjamin won probably read
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   ahead.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:32.920]   Now, on a logical level, they should not win because there are 400,000 men.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.840]   And even the Lord says, "Go, Judah should go first."
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.600]   So it just makes sense that the Israelites should win, but they didn't.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.920]   And so they asked again.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:54.040]   So what happened was that there were 22,000 of the Israelites that died during this battle.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:08:01.800]   Now, all right, so they cried out to the Lord, but they encouraged one another and to take
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.640]   their position again.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:09.800]   And now they're asking the Lord one more time, "Shall we go up against, to battle against
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.440]   the Benjamin Knights, our brothers?"
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.240]   And the Lord one more time answered them, "Go up against them."
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.040]   And so my question again would be, what do you think the result is?
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.480]   And if you've read ahead, maybe you shouldn't answer.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.960]   All right, if you've read ahead, just answer as well.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   Israel won?
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   Yeah, who won?
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.960]   All right.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:40.160]   So this time, if you have picked Israelite to win, you're a very logical person because
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.440]   again, there are way more Israelites than the Benjamin Knights.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.480]   But this time, the Benjamin Knights won again.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.200]   And what we see is that we have...
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.360]   I'm blocking myself.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   Okay.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.600]   We have 18,000 people of the Israelites who died.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   Now this is mind boggling.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.440]   I don't know if you were the Israelites, I don't know if you would back out at this time
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.720]   or if you're just gonna try again, but they were determined.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.720]   So now they're gonna go to the Lord and ask again.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:22.280]   But before that, what we see is that the people wept and they fasted and they presented sacrifices
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.560]   to the Lord.
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:30.000]   And they even asked through this high priest called Fineheights.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.560]   And then they asked, "Shall we go up against the battle with Benjamin, our brother or not?"
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:44.440]   Now again, the Lord replied, "Go tomorrow, for I have given them into your hands."
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.160]   Now let's guess one more time.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.800]   Who's gonna win this time?
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.000]   All right, Israelites are gonna win.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.240]   Thanks, Virginia.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.920]   And that's correct.
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.120]   And this time, eventually, I don't know how many rounds they would have done this if they
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.360]   lost again, but eventually they did win.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:11.080]   And it is the third time that they win.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:17.520]   And this time what we find is that there are only 600 Benjamin Knights surviving, which
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:23.640]   meant there was over 25,000.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.160]   There were 25,000 Benjamin Knights who died.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.080]   Now I just want to ask you, I mean, does it seem right?
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.080]   I don't know.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.720]   What about, you know, listening to this story, something seems off.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.720]   Okay.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.440]   It seems like the Lord said, "All right, go fight them."
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.880]   But then all these men die and, you know, they're asked again.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.800]   I mean, if God wanted to let them win, shouldn't they let them win the first round?
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:53.280]   So there wouldn't be so many Israelites that would die.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.960]   So now I guess it's kind of a rhetorical question, but if you could also answer it, do you have
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:05.760]   any idea why is it that the Lord made the win on the third round, but not the first
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   one?
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.760]   It would have saved us some time.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.760]   We didn't have to read so many Bible verses, right?
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:16.560]   Well, I've looked at this a little bit longer than you have.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.800]   So I can come to an answer right away, which I want to share with you.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.960]   Now something very eerie is happening, right?
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:31.840]   And it brings us to our very first point, which is let God be the king of your decisions.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.200]   Now why do I say that?
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.840]   Because the Israelites, they knew that the men of Gibeah committed an extremely immoral
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:44.680]   act, and they wanted to purge all this evil and just put them to death.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.200]   And they were rightly to do so because in Deuteronomy, it does tell us that capital
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.520]   punishment for serious violation was necessary.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:59.640]   But when Benjamin, that tribe really disturbed that sanction, they had to go against them.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:05.120]   So it only makes sense that the Israelites do quote unquote, what is right in the eyes
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.120]   of the Lord.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.840]   How can that even be wrong?
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.600]   How can God not give them victory on the first round?
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.080]   But if we look more closely, we'll see that the first time they came to the Lord with
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.040]   confidence about what the Lord wanted.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.920]   And they focused on who would go, but not rather or not they would go.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.920]   And God's answer answered them directly.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.920]   If you ask me who, I said Judah.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   Judah should go.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.280]   And the second time again, we looked at it, they added a little, things start to change
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.280]   a little bit.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:45.480]   And not only did they wet because of all the losses, but they start to ask, shall we go?
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.720]   Because Benjamin is actually our brother and we're going to kill them.
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:57.240]   And yet, you know, it seems right because Deuteronomy asked us to purge all the evilness.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:03.520]   And now in the third round, what we see is that they were weeping and they were going
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.520]   to God with a kind of desperation as well.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.240]   But notice that this time the inquiry was very different.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.880]   They actually went to the high priest and also they asked, shall we go just like the
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.480]   second time, but it says or not.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:29.000]   Now, I don't know about you, but this time I could see that the Israelites has changed
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   their attitude.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.440]   When they first came, they knew exactly what they wanted to do.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.920]   And they were just asking God like an endorsement, endorse us, give us this blessing.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.920]   And to the last one, they were really asking God, God, is this what you want?
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.240]   What is it that you want?
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.480]   Help us make decisions that are aligned with what you want.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:56.080]   And we're like that too, you know, where we go to God sometimes with a pre-assumed answer
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.080]   already.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:04.160]   And we just want God to endorse it and give us a stamp so that God can seal the blessing.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.360]   Or let me give you an example.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.880]   Sometimes we might find a girl or a guy that we want to date and we'll pray to God, God,
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.200]   should I be with this person?
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:20.120]   But even before asking them, it seemed like we had an answer in our heart.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.840]   And all we wanted to do is for God to say, yes, go ahead.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.880]   I'm going to bless you and everything will be fine.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:34.600]   Or are we asking him to really seek what is it that he wants as a king in our decision
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.600]   making?
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.800]   What is it that he wants?
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:43.440]   Do we really want his will or are we just saying it and pretending that we want his
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440]   will?
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:52.760]   Now, one way to be sure is that we can check and see if it's okay when he says no.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:15:00.920]   So notice in the last inquiry, it was, shall we go or not?
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.480]   It was showing a sign that they were willing to take no.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.320]   If that was not what God wanted, that's okay.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.600]   Now, before coming to KFCI, I wasn't sure if I should take this role.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.680]   I mean, as much as everything aligned because my background and the needs of this role seemed
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.520]   to match well, I wasn't sure.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:26.560]   And I wanted this role because it was something that I've dreamt of with God and I really
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.520]   want to participate to sharing the truth of God in church.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:38.440]   And I still remember leading up to signing the contract, I was telling God, I want this,
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.400]   but only if you want it to.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:47.280]   And I mean, I'll do my best to go through the interviews and the deacons are here.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.280]   Hello, deacons.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:55.640]   I'm going to try to prepare for this position, but if it isn't what you want, I really told
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:01.200]   God that I would be sad, but I'll be okay.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.800]   And you can do what you want.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:12.200]   I didn't just come here for his endorsement, but I wanted him to make decisions as my king.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.080]   And I think what really changed, because I wasn't always like that.
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.360]   I mean, I probably prayed the prayer of, can I be with this guy, that one that I just shared
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.360]   earlier.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:27.320]   But what this really meant was that because I've experienced him, I've experienced his
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:31.040]   goodness, and I've experienced his love.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.120]   And because I knew how much he loved me, I was able to trust him.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:40.660]   I was able to say, God, I think you make better decisions.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.880]   You should be the king of my decisions, not myself.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:53.000]   And so today here, I think it reminds us also that when we make our everyday life decisions,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.200]   are we just going to him because we want him to endorse us?
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.440]   Or are we going to him because he's the king of our lives in our heart?
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:09.000]   And so we want him to make the decisions for us so that we are going in his will.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   That is something for us to think about.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:17.880]   Now, as we read on, at the end of chapter 20, after there are only 600 Benjamin Knights
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:28.840]   left, actually all the Israelites, not all, sorry, 12,000 men actually went to the Benjamin
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   towns.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:37.760]   In here, it actually didn't specify how many people, but they went to the Benjamin towns
[00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:42.800]   and they've killed everyone there, everything, including the animals and everything that
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.800]   they could find.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.080]   And they even set the towns on fire.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:52.600]   Then in chapter 21, after some time, the Israelites were actually very disturbed.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:58.240]   You see, we're like this, we make a decision, we take action, and then now we're disturbed.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:00.480]   Now why are they disturbed?
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.720]   It's because they realized that they're about to wipe out one of the tribes.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.880]   And there are only 600 people left.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:14.560]   And the biggest problem is, was they made two oaths right here.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.280]   These are the two oaths they made before the battle.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:25.880]   They said, now the men of Israel had sworn and misbe, that no one of us should give his
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.760]   daughter in marriage to the Benjamin.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:37.160]   And also another oath that they said was that anyone who did not come to the battle and
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.640]   misbe, he shall surely be put to death.
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:50.240]   So now, even though they are regretting or they're mourning over the fact that the tribe
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.680]   of Benjamin might be wiped out, there's nothing much they could do because they can't give
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.000]   their married daughters, you see the old men there are left.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.200]   And they can't give their daughters to them.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:06.440]   And also they have this other oath, which says that they could kill anybody that didn't
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.720]   participate in the battle.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:15.560]   And so some very smart man, I guess, oh, smart with a quotation, thought, oh, you know what,
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:18.520]   let's kill off the people that didn't come.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.920]   And those were the ones at Jebel Dillit.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:26.280]   I'm going to show you where that place is right here.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.000]   So these were the people that didn't come to the battle.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.360]   And so now this time, they are sending 12,000 men to strike down the inhabitants.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:43.800]   But there is actually an interesting clause in Leviticus 5 that says that if you were
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:49.080]   to wipe out the entire town, that you could save the virgins.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.920]   So those are the only survivors.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.120]   And they have saved 400 virgins, female virgins.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   And they brought them back.
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   And they're like, oh, what should we do with these virgins?
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:05.880]   How about giving it to the men that we were worried about what to do with them?
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:12.080]   And so what they did was they gave the 400 female virgins to the 600 men, of course,
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:13.260]   they weren't enough.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.360]   So then they're now short of only 200 females.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:26.000]   And so what we find is that it brings us to our second point, which is, let God be the
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.680]   king of your speech.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:36.280]   Now the problem that this all arise was because they had these oaths in which they didn't
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.240]   necessarily need to have at the beginning of the battle.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:47.520]   And they didn't need to say these oaths, and they could have just started the battle.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:52.520]   But in the moment, in the heat of the moment, they wanted to say those things.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.520]   But where were those things coming from?
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:21:02.080]   Just from their own heart, desire, emotion at that time, they were not coming from the
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.340]   king, which is the God.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:07.200]   It was not God who asked them to make these oaths.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.760]   It was out of their own will that they said these things.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:17.920]   And now in similar way, in moments, we might be prompted to say something because we felt
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.920]   right.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.440]   It might not be what God's thinking, but that was certainly what our emotions are telling
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.440]   us.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.840]   And sometimes you might make a rash oath or a statement in the heat of the moment, something
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:36.320]   like, "I'm never going to speak to them again," or "I'm going to love you forever," or "I
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:42.080]   can forgive you anything," or "I can't stand you.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:43.080]   I want a divorce."
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:49.560]   And as much as these might not be an oath like, "Oh God, I'm speaking to him and I'm
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:55.440]   promising in the name of the Lord," we are actually making a statement in which theoretically
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.520]   we should keep intact.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   But what we find more often than not is that we are driven, our speech is driven by our
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.240]   emotions and our personal desire, or we might want, I mean, like these men here, they might
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.120]   probably want to be more spiritual.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.440]   Because when they say, "I won't give any daughters to the Benjaminites," they're really
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:20.680]   saying, "Oh, I'm so spiritual," and in which they might be, but it was out of rash.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.680]   It was out of things that they didn't think of ahead of time.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:26.760]   And that's the thing with us too.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:34.520]   Now when we have to think of what things we say, are we speaking out of rash too?
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:37.440]   Because that will make us sound spiritual.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.760]   That will make us sound righteous, and that is what our emotions are driving us.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:48.760]   Or are we going to go to God and say, "God, this situation is really tough.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:52.480]   People are doing this and that, but what do you want?
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.520]   Or what should I say on your behalf?
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.400]   What should my speech be?
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.600]   Are we letting our King, our God, guide us in our speech?"
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:10.040]   Now, if our God is guiding our heart, it would be that he could guide our speech too.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:16.720]   But if what's inside of our heart, we are our own kings, we just do what we see fit,
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.600]   then what we say is also out of ourselves.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:28.120]   And so now, let us keep on reading because we do still have one issue that we haven't
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.120]   solved.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.560]   We don't, they have one issue that they haven't solved, which is there are still 200 Benjamin
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.520]   Knights that are without a wife.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.960]   Now what should they do with it?
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:47.000]   And as we continue to read on, they actually offer a solution that not only wouldn't violate
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.280]   their oath, I mean, it wouldn't violate their oath, but then it would be a very immoral
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.280]   act.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.920]   And this is what they suggest to the Benjamin Knights.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:06.000]   "And they commanded the people of Benjamin saying, 'Go and lie in ambush in the vineyards
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   and watch.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.720]   If the daughters of Silo come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:21.560]   and snatch each man his wife from the daughters of Silo and go to the land of Benjamin.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:27.160]   And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, 'Grant
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:34.520]   them graciously to us because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:40.480]   Neither did you give them to them, else you would be now guilty.'
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:46.160]   And so the people of Benjamin did so and took their wives according to the number from the
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.600]   dancers whom they carried off."
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.600]   Now I don't know, each episode just gets more eerie than the last one.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.600]   It's now all of a sudden, they were trying to kill these men off because they were acting
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.880]   immorally.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.920]   And now they're turning reverse and asking them, "You know what?
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.760]   We don't have enough wives for you.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.640]   So when these dancers come, just grab one that you like and bring them home."
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.760]   And we're thinking, "Oh my God, what's happening here?"
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:24.240]   And so this really brings us to our third point, which is to let...
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.680]   Oh, before our third point, this is where Silo is.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:32.040]   So they're getting the wives there.
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:38.840]   And this gets to our third point, which is let God be the king of your actions.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:45.360]   Now it isn't enough just to have God guide in our decisions, guide us in what we say,
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:52.080]   but it's equally important for him to be the king of our actions.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.800]   And sometimes it's easy to justify our actions, right?
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.600]   We can say, "Oh, we just want to do this.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.040]   It's for the good of these people."
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.120]   But along the way, we might have lied to people.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.480]   We might have stabbed some people and...
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:16.520]   Not literally stabbing them, but maybe saying bad things behind their backs just to achieve,
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.680]   quote unquote, what we call a good outcome.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.240]   And this is what the people here have been doing.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:29.560]   They can legitimize their action and think that the end justifies the means.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:34.640]   And in order for them to preserve this tribe, they think that's okay.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.920]   I mean, they're taking wives for themselves so that this tribe can continue.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.040]   So it's for a good cause, you know?
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.560]   You're doing a good job by letting them do this.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.720]   And we actually see that around us sometimes, don't we?
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.720]   We have seen...
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:56.000]   I mean, even ourselves, we might legitimize certain action to say, "This is for a good
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   cause.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.680]   We should do this."
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:05.560]   And for example, sex before marriage is not biblical.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:11.880]   And yet some Christians may have sex or even cohabitated with their boyfriend or girlfriend,
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.160]   thinking that one day we'll marry each other anyways.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.120]   And some people can even convince themselves to say, "It will be a good practice to see
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.960]   if we're like right for each other."
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.760]   And the end does not justify the means.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:33.520]   And even if they were to get married someday, it doesn't mean that they could do this in
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.520]   the meanwhile.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.520]   It's like the Israelites.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:41.960]   They wanted to preserve the tribe of Benjamin, but that doesn't mean that they could just
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.680]   take virgins for themselves.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:49.400]   It doesn't mean they can just grab dancers and literally rape them afterwards and call
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.160]   them as wives.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.320]   Those are immoral acts.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:28:01.080]   And we need to let God be our king and guide our actions through him guiding our hearts
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.280]   first.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.760]   And it's allowing us to think about, are we our actions?
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.880]   Are we following what he teaches us in the Bible?
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:14.360]   Are we following the word of God?
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.640]   Or are we constantly just legitimizing this?
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.040]   Oh, this makes sense because at the end of the day, it'll be good.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.520]   Or are we really taking them seriously without any compromise?
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:30.200]   And we need to do that because he is our king.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:37.760]   And this king deserves that our action along the way, whether it's the process or the ending,
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.560]   has his character, is aligned with his word.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:49.320]   Now, dear friends, as we close today, not only for chapters 20 and for 21, but for the
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:57.520]   entire book of Judges, the author ends interestingly or rightfully with this statement, summing
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:06.000]   up the entire book, which is in those days, there was no king in Israel.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:22.440]   Now the ultimate root of Israelites' problem was because they had no king and no one guided
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.440]   them.
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.040]   They didn't tell them what to do, and they just thought that they were following God.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:34.480]   And they thought when they inquired God about their decisions, that they were actually following
[00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:40.640]   God when in fact, they already made up their minds and they were following themselves.
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.360]   And in the same way, when they made those oaths sounding spiritual and sounding like
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:51.480]   they were following God, they were just following their desires and trying to make them look
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:59.320]   good or trying to sound like they were doing the right thing, but boxing in God.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:05.920]   And in their actions to try to preserve the tribe of Benjamin, they were not doing things
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.840]   according to what God wanted.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.960]   They were just trying to fix the problem.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.960]   It was like covering up for their mistakes.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:18.280]   And so the author tells us that they had no physical king.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:26.480]   But we as readers now know that God would eventually rise up a king for them.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:32.840]   And that would be from the line of Judah and King David would come.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:39.160]   And eventually God would establish the ultimate ideal king, which is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.880]   Now, however, we're not like them.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.040]   We already have our king.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:49.920]   Our king, Lord Jesus is already here and he has given us his spirit and he has placed
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.640]   it inside of us.
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.440]   We have a king.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:06.480]   But, and I say, but are we still acting like we don't have a king?
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.320]   Now if you're still holding on to making decisions for yourself and not willing to let God have
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:15.520]   a say, maybe let him say no.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.480]   Is that okay?
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:23.080]   Then I ask you to repent and let him guide your every decision.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:29.000]   Maybe it seems hard at first because you don't want to let go, but he's good and he loves
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.480]   you and you will give you what is best for you.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.400]   And that will also be his will.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:42.520]   Now at the same time, if you have trouble controlling your words and the things that
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:51.000]   you say, it may have been according to your own desires and often you regret it soon after.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.400]   And you can't seem to reverse them as well.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:32:01.180]   Well, I invite you also to repent because the Lord Jesus is good and he will help you
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.400]   wipe out those things that you say and allow you to have a new start.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.960]   And he will guide you in the words that you say so you can say words that you mean and
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:13.380]   let your yes be a yes and no be a no.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:20.560]   And as you speak, you will speak of with Jesus's character too.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:28.920]   And now lastly, if you've been just taking actions according to what you wanted to do,
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:34.400]   and maybe sometimes even covering up for mistakes that you've done, I want to say you don't
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.520]   have to do that anymore.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:44.440]   And I invite you to repent as well and ask God to help you so that we don't only arrive
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:52.760]   at the right destination, but then the methodology to arriving there is also one that follows
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.760]   God.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:33:04.000]   Now, if you've responded to all those invitations with a yes, so let your King, our God, guide
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   you in your heart.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.320]   Then really all you need to do, because it's nothing that we can do for ourselves, but
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:19.920]   all we do is we pray to God and we ask him to be our King, ask him to guide us.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:25.120]   Even though we can't do it sometimes, but if we ask him, his spirit will help us and
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.200]   his word will guide us to the right path.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:34.760]   And meanwhile, we can, while we pray, we can read his word and maybe just one chapter a
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.760]   day.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:44.000]   If you really want to make God your King in your heart, in your decisions, in your speech,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.280]   in your actions, then dedicating that one chapter a day to know him and to pray to him
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:56.960]   to help us so that he can be the King of our hearts, he would definitely listen to our
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.160]   prayer and help us on that.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:05.760]   So then, you know, I want to end with this, which is, you know, one day I really hope
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:12.720]   that we're all in our old age and you know what, we'll look back and then we'll say this.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:23.240]   In those days, there was a King in my heart and I did what was right in his eyes.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.880]   And I pray that that would be a statement that we can all say.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   Let us pray together.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:40.160]   Dear Heavenly Father, you're our God, you're our King, but how often do we really treat
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.640]   you that way?
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:47.480]   In our decisions, in our speech, in our actions.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:55.400]   Father, we just want to come to you and say, we're sorry for the times that we haven't,
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   but we know that you're a good, good father.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   We know that you're a good God.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:07.400]   We know that as we call out to you right now and on the day that we call out to you in
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:14.400]   bed or in the evening or at night, that you would come and help us, that you would come
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.400]   and be our King in our hearts.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:25.400]   In every day of our lives, we want to be the best God for you.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.460]   you
