[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   And good morning to those who will be watching tomorrow morning.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   I'm just so thankful tonight that I get to share on the topic,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   "Take Every Thought Captive,"
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and so that we can really align it with God's heart.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   It's one that's really big on my heart
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   because I believe that I've struggled so much with it
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   and yet because of God, I've overcame it.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And sometimes I might fall into it again,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   but I know for certain that I have the tools because of Christ
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   that I can overcome it again.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So let's start off.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   How many thoughts do you think we have in one day?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Anyone want to take a wild guess?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   How many thoughts?
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   A hundred.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Okay, anyone want to give more than a hundred?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   A hundred thousand, wow.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Okay, somewhere in between that range, okay,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   is actually 6,000 thoughts.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   We have 6,000 thoughts according to Queen's University,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   their study shows.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Now, if we're awake for about a good 16 hours,
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   that would mean about 6.25 thoughts in one minute.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   So just within this one minute,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   6.25 thoughts just flew by in your mind.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   So my other question to you is,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   how many of you think you can actually control what you think?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Now, I'm going to take a poll again, okay?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   We don't have a QR code for this,
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   let's do it the old-fashioned way.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   If you think you have control over your thoughts,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   you can put up your hand like this.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   If you think you have control over your thoughts sometimes,
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   you can kind of go like this.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And if you think you don't,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   just keep your hands on your lap, okay?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   All right, one, two, three, show of hands.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   All right, we've got like one of this
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   and about a good handful of these.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And some of those,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I don't think you have control over your arms, right?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   So just keeping it down there.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah, so what we do find is,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   do we or do we not have this ability?
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Now, according to the Bible,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   actually the title kind of gives it away
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   'cause it says take every thought captive.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   So according to the Bible, we can,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   we have the ability to,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   but you are actually all correct
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   when you either put up your hand this way,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   this way or this way
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   because our experiences tell us otherwise.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Sometimes it seems like we can
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   but sometimes it seems like we can't.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And maybe for some of us,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   we've never even thought about what we thought of.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   So all of those were correct
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   because those were your experiences
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   and yet the truth tells us
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   that we can indeed capture every thought
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   and make it obedient to Christ.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   So tonight we're gonna talk about
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   why we even bother to do that
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and what does it really mean to capture
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   and then make it obedient to Christ
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   and how we're gonna do that.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So just three things.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And so the,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   so the very first thing that we wanna look at
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   is a few verses, few, when I say few today
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   it will be a little bit longer, but stick with me.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   It will be from Numbers chapter 13 to 14.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Now, before that, I wanna give you
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   a little bit of a background on what happened, okay?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Some of you may already heard this and know it,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   but I do wanna say it for those
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   who might be here new or are not very familiar.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So in Exodus, we see that the Israelites
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   have been slaves for 400 years.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And in Egypt, and so they're calling out to God,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   "God, save us, we don't wanna be slaves anymore."
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And God hears their prayers and sends Moses
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   to help them by being their leader to lead them out.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Now, Pharaoh, do you think he would want these people to go?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   No, okay, yeah, no, he doesn't.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Why not?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Because this is like cheap labor, right?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Who wants cheap labor to go?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   No one wants them to go.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So God then performs these 10 miraculous signs
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   or miraculous ways to save them.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Of course, it's miraculous to the Israelites,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   but they're actually plagues to the Egyptians.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And so after 10 of them, Egypt's almost wiped out.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And so Pharaoh says, "Oh, yes, please go.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   "We don't want you here anymore.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   "You're causing more trouble than good."
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And so they leave, and of course,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   the Egyptians change their mind, chase after them,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   and we hear the famous story about how God parts the Red Sea
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   and they walk through it on dry ground.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And then as the Egyptians go through,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   the waters come back, and then they all die.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So we were thinking, all right, everything from now on
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   is gonna be smooth sailing, right?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Not quite, because the Israelites are in the desert now,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   and they're grumbling like, "Oh, there's no food, no water."
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   And so they travel to this promised land
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   in which God has promised to their forefathers, okay?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So, so far, I think some of you have heard these before.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And so we arrive to Numbers chapter 13 and 14,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   where they have arrived at pretty much the border
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   of where the promised land would be.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   And so Moses sends out 12 spies,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   and he decides that let's gather some information,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   survey the land, so then we will know what's happening.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   So after 40 days, these are the accounts,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   and there were 10 spies, so he sends out 12.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   10 of them said, "The people who live there are powerful,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   "and the cities are fortified, very large.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   "We can't attack those people.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   "They are stronger than we are.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   "The land we explore devours those living in it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   "All the people we saw are a great size.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   "We seem like grasshoppers."
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And so on the other hand, we still got two other spies,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   the famous Caleb and also, what's the other one?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Joshua.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   But Caleb says something first, and he says,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   "We should go up and take possession of the land,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   "for we can certainly do it."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Now, having heard these two accounts,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   now we have the rest of the Israelites,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   which were about 2 million people, okay?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   So they're listening to these accounts,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   and this is what they say.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   "They grumbled against Moses and Aaron,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   "and the whole assembly said to them,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   "'If only we had died in Egypt or in this desert!
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   "'Why is the Lord bringing us to this land
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   "'only to let us fall by the sword?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   "'Our wives and children would be taken as plunder.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   "'Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?'
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   "And they said to each other,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   "'We should choose a leader and go back to Egypt.'"
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And then Joshua, hearing this, Joshua and Caleb says,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   "Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And then they're like, they tore their clothes,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   because that was a way for them to express
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   how deeply sorrowed they were.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And then they said to the entire Israelite assembly,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   "The land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good."
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   So obviously very different than the other account.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   And it says, "If the Lord is pleased with us,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   "He will lead us into that land,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   "a land flowing with milk and honey,
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   "and will give it to us.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   "Only do not rebel against the Lord
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   "and do not be afraid of the people of the land,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   "because we will swallow them up,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   "and their protection is gone.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   "But the Lord is with us.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   "Do not be afraid of them."
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Now, after hearing this,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   do you think the Israelites were pumped up?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Yeah, let's go take the land.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   No, they weren't.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And instead, this is what happens.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   But the whole assembly talked about stoning them.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Now having all this, you know, God's not dead, right?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   He's not deaf either.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   He can hear everything.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And so God appears to all of Israelites,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   and then He tells Moses,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   "I'm gonna destroy them."
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And he's so disappointed.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And Moses pleaded with God, "Please forgive them."
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   And God forgave them.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   But nonetheless, God made up His mind
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   about what would be their outcome.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And to the Israelite assemblies,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   the whole of Israelites,
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   which was about two million people, He said,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   "Not one of the man who disobeyed me
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   "and tested me 10 times."
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Now 10 times, not really an exact number,
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   but meaning many times here.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   "Will ever see the land I promise
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   "on oath to their forefathers.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   "No one who has treated me with contempt
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   "will ever see it.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   "In this desert, your bodies will fall.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   "Every one of you, 20 years old or more,
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   "who has grumbled against me.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   "Your children will be shepherds here for 40 years,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   "suffering for your unfaithfulness
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   "until the last of your bodies dies in the desert.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   "For 40 years, you will suffer for your sins
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   "and know what it is like to have me against you.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   "I will surely do these things
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   "to the whole wicked community
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   "which has banded together against me.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   "In this desert, here they will die."
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Now, I purposely didn't skip these verses
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   by just telling you the outcome
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   because I wanted you to see the words
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   that come out of the mouth of God
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   and how much that he detested it.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Now, to the 10 spies, remember the 10 that went,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   this is his verdict.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   "These men responsible for spreading the bad report
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   "about the land were struck down
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   "and died of plague before the Lord."
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   So these 10 died literally right there.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Now, of course, a very favorable verdict
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   to Joshua and Caleb, God said,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   "Because my servant Caleb has a different spirit
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   "and follows me wholeheartedly,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   "I will bring him into the land he went to
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   "and his descendants will inherit it.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   "Not one of the Israelites will enter the land I swore,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   "except Caleb and Joshua."
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Actually, when you read this account,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I don't know about you, but I have a shivering feeling
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   because you see, God had intended
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   for every one of the Israelites
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   to enter into his promised land,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   but not everyone made it.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Only two out of how many?
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Two million, okay, so this is a very, very odd,
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   this is very low percentage.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And what does that tell us?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   You know, if we don't think right,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   we're not going to live right.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And if we're not gonna live right,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   we are not going to enter into God's plan for us.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   And so this brings us to our first point.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   Why do we need to take every thought captive to Christ?
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Because our thoughts determine our destiny.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Now, sometimes we have this idea, you know,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   oh, God has everything planned out, so you know what?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I'll just kind of wing my way through,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   whatever I do doesn't matter,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   because I will eventually get to whatever it is
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   that God wants me to have.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   But according to this account, when we see it,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   it doesn't seem to suggest this way.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   This actually tells us that some people made it
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   into God's intended plan, and some people didn't.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Now, I don't know about you,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   but I definitely want to be one of those who made it
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   to the promised land, whatever it is that he has in store for me.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   So this is why taking every thought captive is important.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   So let's look at what it means to do that.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   But notice in 2 Corinthians,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   earlier when we looked at the verse, "Take captive,"
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   which in those days, if they had read it in Apostle Paul's time,
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   they would be thinking about war.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   So when you take captive of someone, it means to imprison them,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   meaning that person would not have any freedom,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   they would not have a say in terms of what they could eat,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   where they could go, what they would be able to do.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And that's what it means to take captive.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Now, in a similar way, that's what we want to do with our thoughts.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   But how does that work?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Because it's easier if it's a physical person.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   I can just hold on to James.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Maybe not him, he's stronger.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I've got to find someone not as strong as me.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Okay, maybe I'll go to the kids' room.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   You know, hold on to him, right?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   But what about our thoughts?
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   How do we do that?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   And so this brings us to our second point,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   that in order to take captive of every thought,
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   we first need to catch the wrong thoughts.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   So we need to identify what the wrong thoughts are.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   In order to capture it.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Now, if we looked at the earlier account, right,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   remember what the ten spies were like.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   We'll look at what they said, right?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   They said, "We can't attack them.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   They're stronger than we are.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And the land that we exploit is devouring the people in it.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   We're like grasshoppers."
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   I mean, what is it that you see about these people?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Is that they're pessimists.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   I might even call them extreme pessimists
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   because they over-exaggerate.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Because imagine if that person had been like a grasshopper,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   then their opponent would have to actually be like 15 stories high.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   So obviously we don't see anybody that tall.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   So what we see is this, if we have pessimist thoughts,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   they're actually wrong thoughts that will lead us to wrong beliefs.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And I mean, sometimes we might think of it,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   like everyday life, we have a lot of thoughts going on.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And it might be that we might think, "This can't be done.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   This is never going to work."
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Or if I'm a newcomer, or even if I'm an old comer,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I come in, no one says hi to me.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   So I'm thinking, "You know what?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   No one likes me."
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   And if it keeps going in a pessimistic direction,
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   "No one ever likes me.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Why do I, I shouldn't even live on."
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   You know, so it's like a spiral of negativity that we go in.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   So catch it.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   That's the first wrong thought, first type of wrong thought.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And the second one that we see is from the Israelite assemblies.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I mean, what do we see them like?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   They said, "If only we had died in Egypt."
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   So they would rather die in Egypt than to try to get this land
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   that they're about to go in.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   "Why does the Lord bring us here?
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Wouldn't it be better for us if we're back in Egypt to be slaves?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Why don't we just get another leader and let's go back?"
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   What kind of people are these?
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Well, they're faithless and grumbling ones.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I don't know if you know any of them around,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   but they're not fun to be with because they grumble about everything.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   You know, you can do a very nice, you know,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   you can finish, you know, a nice meal with 10 dishes,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   and they might be the one that says, "Wait, this one doesn't have enough onions on it."
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Right?
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Or like if you--it might be something small,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   like maybe if we miss the minibus or, you know, we're like,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   "Oh, why did our neighbors come out at this--the same time
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   so I can't press the elevator fast enough to catch this bus?"
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   And they seem to like blame stuff on like just everyone.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Okay?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And they grumble not against--not only against people,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   but notice they also grumble against God.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   "Why did God let this happen?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Why did God let me meet that person?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Why did he bring me to this job?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Why did he give me this child?"
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   You know?
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Okay, hopefully none of you think that way.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Not a parent yet, so I can't say much about that.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And so this is another kind of wrong thinking, grumbling.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Okay?
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   And also faithless.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Instead of what?
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Bringing the issue that we have to God,
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   we actually bring the issue against God.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   We're saying that--they're saying that God's against us the whole time.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   So now that we know what the wrong thoughts are,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   of course we turn to the right thought.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   And you know who they are, Caleb and Joshua.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Now look at them.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   They said, "We should go up, take possession of the land,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   and we can certainly do it."
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And they said, "The land is exceedingly good."
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   And this is a true account,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   because those spies actually brought back some abundant fruits.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Okay?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   So unlike the other account, which was untrue.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And if the Lord--notice, I love how they put the Lord into the equation
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   in a positive way.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   "If the Lord is pleased with us, he will lead us.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   The Lord is with us.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Do not be afraid of them."
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And you know, when God gave his verdict about them,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   I really liked how he said it.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   He said they had a different spirit.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   A different spirit.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   And these people, you know, whenever they're faced with challenges,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   they're able to bring it to God.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   They say, "God will deliver us.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   He will provide a way.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   He's going to get us a solution.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Somehow he's going to make us be able to go through it."
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And these are the people that if we happen to be on those wrong thoughts,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   you know what?
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   Which means that we have a different spirit than they do,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   sometimes we kind of want to stone them.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Don't you?
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   Because you might be like, "Oh, everything's so hard," you know?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And then they say all these positive things, and you're like,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   "I can't stand you."
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And that might be because we're in a different spirit,
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   which means that we have colliding thoughts.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   But these people are the people that we need to learn from.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   And, all right, so now you know why, because it will cause our destiny
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   if we don't take captive of our thoughts.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And now that we know what we need to take captives of,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   which are these wrong thoughts.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   All right, so I know I'm doing these things,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   but what am I going to do about them?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   All right, this is where we continue on to see how we can bring them
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   obedient to Christ.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   It really, you know, if I have to make you think of an image,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   it's kind of like catching butterflies.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Okay, I know, I don't know where you guys are now, but just go with me.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Catching butterflies, right?
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   So you caught it, what are you going to do with it?
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   You are going to put it in a confined space,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I mean, unless it was just for the fun of catching it,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   but you're going to put it maybe in an aquarium,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   somewhere where you're going to keep it in a confined area.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And this is exactly what we're going to do with our thought.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Instead of letting it continue on,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   remember the spiral of negativity or those grumbling, you know,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   we can go on all day thinking those negative thoughts, right?
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   So when we capture it, we're going to confine it.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And the moment is like saying, wait a minute,
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   I don't think God wants me to think this thought.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   I don't think it's even biblical.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And that's the moment you've actually imagined with me.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   That's the moment you actually caught it.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Okay, so now you're going to put it into a spot, right?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   That's God's word.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   So we're going to go to our third point,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   which is after you caught the wrong thoughts,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   then focus your thoughts on God.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Now, how do you do that?
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Well, by looping your thoughts with God's truth over and over,
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   then there's no easier way for me to put it
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   than to call it a godly brainwash.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   I don't know if you've ever done that,
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   but it's a godly brainwash of truth.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Now, Louis Giglio likes to call it DJing your thoughts,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   and I think both of them work.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   And so what we can do is to open the Bible or to read it,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   to listen to a sermon or to read a book full of biblical truth
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   where we then, instead of being influenced
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   and dwell in that negativity,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   we are starting to influence those thoughts.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And we will then be putting it obedient to Christ.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   And so next time, when you're going through
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   and you caught that thought, you have to turn it to God.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   And now I want to turn to Psalm 3
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   to give you kind of an example of how King David,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   when he was being chased by his son,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   now not to have fun,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   his son wasn't chasing him to play tennis with him.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   He was chasing him so he can take over his throne and to kill him.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   He was in such a distressed moment.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Maybe if we were grumbling, we would say,
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   "God, why did you ever let me have this son?"
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   or "Why did you even make me king?"
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Or if we're really negative, he might say,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   "Why make me king so then I would die in my own son's hand?"
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   That would be a negative thought.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   But in here, he does not.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   And I want to share with you how he does it
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   by not brainwashing for him.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   He's already taken it in, so it's part of him.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   And so I didn't put out verse 1 and 2,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   but verse 1 and 2 said,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   "Lord, how many are my foes?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   How many rise up against me?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Many are even saying, 'God will not deliver me.'"
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   This is where it turns.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   This is where he puts his thought in obedient to Christ.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   He says, "But you, Lord, are a shield around me,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   my glory, the one who lifts my head high.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   I call out to the Lord and he answers me.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   The Lord sustains me.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   I will not fear, though tens of thousands assail me on every side.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Arise, Lord, deliver me, my God.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Strike all my enemies on the jaw.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Break the teeth of the wicked."
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   See how he does not dwell on the negativity.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   It's not that he doesn't have this problem, okay?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   His son is still trying to kill him.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   But he turns his thought to God and he says, "But you."
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   He doesn't look at the situation.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   He turns to God for who he is, his character,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   and how he has the ability to deliver him.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And that's what we need to do.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   When we focus our thoughts on God,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   we will please him and he will lead us into his plans
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   as he was pleased with Joshua and Caleb.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Now I want to share a personal example with you.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   As I shared, I think, some months ago,
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   that in the past I had broken up with an eligible bachelor
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   when I was around 29 years old.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   And I got quite depressed and pessimistic
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   to the point where I thought to myself,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   I'm never gonna find anybody to be with
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   that would love me and be as good to me.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   And all the Christian guys that are leftover,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   not leftover, sorry.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   I mean, that are not taken.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   (congregation laughing)
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Obviously, these are lies, right?
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   You know that.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   That are not taken.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Kind of not my type, you know.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   And so these negative thoughts would just come and come
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   and would cloud me to an extreme point
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   where I became just so hopeless.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   I really remember looking out the window and thought,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   you know, why bother?
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   There's nothing good left for me.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   You see how that spiral can go down.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   It was so sad.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   But at the same time, I was like, but I'm a Christian.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   If I commit suicide, not sure if I make it to heaven.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   You know, you have that, it's a Christian struggle.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   And knowing my faith, you know,
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   the little ounce that I still had,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   I did not, but I prayed the prayer.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   I'm not sure if some of you have ever prayed it,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   which is, God, please take me home.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   'Cause you can't do anything actively about it,
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   but you would pray that prayer
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   'cause you're in such a distressed moment.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And so I still remember at that time,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   I probably grumbled to God as well.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Like, why didn't things work out for me?
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   I've been a Christian for so many years.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   You know, why don't you just make it smoother for me?
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Everybody else is smoother.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And so I would grumble against him.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   And I'm not saying that we can't have any emotions.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Please don't feel like we can't even talk to God,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   'cause that's not what I want you to take away.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   But instead of grumbling, remember, add God.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Bring your issue to God.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   It's a very, very big difference.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And so I was so weak at that point.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Remember I said, oh, you can open your Bible to read
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   or things like that.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   I wasn't even able to do that.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   So what I did, I guess it's another promotion for YouTube, right?
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   We said the goodness of YouTube.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Gotta have a song on that.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Is that I landed on sermons by Joyce Meyer,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   one of my favorite preachers.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   And she just had these motivative sermons
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   where she spoke the truth so well and so powerfully.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   It helped me.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   She told me that God loves you.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   God has a plan for you.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   And your story's not over yet.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   And there's more to come.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   And God's powerful to say,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   you're the head and not the tail, above and not beneath.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And even though those scriptures,
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   they're truly scriptures, but she spoke them out.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And that was when it gave me power.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   It was almost like, not almost,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   it was the moment when I captured those thoughts
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   and it was in obedience with God.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And I had this surge.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I'm like, oh, yes, I can do it.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   And guess how long it lasted.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   One hour.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And all those wrong thoughts came back and I'm like,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   oh, I'm never gonna make it.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And then I'll be like, okay,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   let's press the sermon again.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   And oh, I'm charged.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   So I'm like, it's just like a rollercoaster ride
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   where I'm like, oh, I'm dying.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Oh, I'm charged, I'm dying, I'm charged.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And to a point where I'm like, oh my gosh,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I think I'm just gonna,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   my head's just gonna explode or something.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   But there was, you know,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   the frequency then began slowly to increase.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   So instead of one hour apart, you know,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   slowly it was two hours apart
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   before I needed an extra dose of God's truth, right?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And then before I know it, it's three hours, four hours,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   half a day, one day, one week, a week and a half.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And maybe I fall back to two days and, you know,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   it bounced back and forth.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And eventually one month, two months, a year.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   And now I just listened to it to get more knowledge,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   not for the boost.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And what do I wanna say?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Well, you see, I could have died in that moment.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Not that I, I don't think I actually would have,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   but what more was, I could have withered away,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   which meant that I can just continue to live on
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   being a weakless Christian going like,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   oh, my days, oh, let's go to work, you know.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I could have continued the rest of my life like that,
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   couldn't I?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   But because of God's grace and how he taught me,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   take captive of those thoughts, the wrong ones,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   make them obedient to Christ.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   And he used that method to help me.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   And for you, it can be other things.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   It doesn't have to be that.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   It can be like listening to KFCI sermons
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   over and over again, right?
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And whatever it may be,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   we need to make it obedient to Christ.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And when we do, I mean, my life has turned around
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   and I believe just like in Numbers chapter 13 and 14,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   yours will too, yours will too.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   And really, I believe I walked into God's plan.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   I mean, I'm standing here today,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   which I don't think I could have
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   if I continued with those negative thoughts,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   with those grumbling and faithless thoughts.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   But when we begin to think right,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   do you know what's the most important thing?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Is that we please our God.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   That's what it said.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Remember what Joshua and Caleb said?
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   If God is pleased with us,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   he will lead us into that land.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   And I wanna say with your faithful thoughts,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   if you make it obedient to Christ,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   following him in terms of just
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   repeatedly thinking about his goodness,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   thinking about how he's gonna deliver you,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   slowly let that become your belief
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   that pleases God.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   And I don't know, when you please God,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   I don't know where he's gonna take you,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   but it's gonna be far, it's gonna be good.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   It's gonna be that land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And I wanna be there and I want all of us to be there.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   All of us, not two out of 2 million,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   but all of us.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   And so my friends, I don't know what issues
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   you're facing right now or maybe in the future.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Is it getting through exams and thinking,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   oh, I'm never gonna make it, it's so hard.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Am I gonna pass this year?
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Or is it getting careers so that it can be something
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   that you like and also has a stable income?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Or is it to find a godly boyfriend or girlfriend?
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Or is it to want a harmonious relationship
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   with your spouse or with your kids?
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   Or maybe it's getting your family members
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   to come to church, that might be a hurticle.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   A hurticle, what is that?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   (laughs)
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Hurdle.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And did I just make up a new word?
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   (audience laughs)
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Or is it to have your unbearable co-worker
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   and how to deal with it?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Or is it to have better health?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Whatever it is, take Psalm, one of those prayers
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   and just say, yes, I'm facing this problem
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   and then say, but you, my God,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   is the one who protects me, is the one who lifts my head,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   is the one who will make a way for me,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   is the one who loves me.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And if you do that, I believe that it will please God
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   and God will lead you into his plans
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   and you will fulfill it and you'll see the promised land.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Not see it, 'cause a lot of people see it.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   You'll be in the promised land.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And sometimes, I just wanna make another note,
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   it might not be a big issue.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   Start with the smaller ones.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   Remember my missing the minibus example?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Start with the smaller ones.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   You don't have to be in a devastating situation
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   I don't want you to be in.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   But try to catch the small ones.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   When you make a mistake, you're like,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   oh, I can never do anything right.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   That's the moment you catch it.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   Or when you feel like, oh, that co-worker
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   or that friend just did this to me.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Why did I even meet them?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   That's the moment you catch it.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   They're just small things, but start with those.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   And then our faith will continue to grow.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   Because when we think right
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   and have the thoughts that God wanted us to have,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   what will we need to fear?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   There's nothing to fear, because we know who is with us.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   It is the almighty God.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   He is with us.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   Whom shall we fear?
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   So I really pray, this is my prayer,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   that all of us enter into the land of milk and honey.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Let us pray together.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Dear heavenly Father,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   we thank you so much for your goodness.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   You're our God.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   You're the one who saved us,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   who has given your son, Jesus Christ, to us.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   You will not withhold anything good from us.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   And Father, we pray that in all circumstances,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   no matter how big, how small, how challenging it may be,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   so challenging that we feel like we cannot overcome,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   that Father, in that moment, help us take our thoughts captive,
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   know what the wrong thoughts are.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Help us, Father, to repeatedly proclaim who you are
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   and how good you are to us.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   And Father, we know you are with us the whole time.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   And we just want to thank you.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   You're the awesome God.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   You are with us.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   We shall not fear anything that is ahead.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
