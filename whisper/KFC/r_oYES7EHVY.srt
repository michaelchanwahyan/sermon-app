 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

178
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,360
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

179
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,760
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

180
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,160
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

181
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,560
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

182
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,960
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

183
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,360
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

184
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,760
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

185
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,160
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

186
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,560
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

187
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,960
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

188
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,360
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

189
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,760
 And she is a woman of the Jewish faith.

190
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,560
 Now, if Bathsheba was seducing the king,

191
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
 because we do have two schools of thought,

192
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
 then the lesson is obvious.

193
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,960
 Well, don't tempt others in sexual matters,

194
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,160
 or cause others to stumble.

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
 Now, if the other camp of people,

196
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,560
 if Bathsheba was a victim,

197
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,560
 and had actually been kind of dragged in

198
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,160
 by David's sexual temptation and sin,

199
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,360
 then we would sympathize with her.

200
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
 And instead, we'll think about,

201
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,360
 how is it that she could find ways to protect herself

202
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,560
 from becoming a victim?

203
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,960
 So rather you're on one camp or the other,

204
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,560
 the lessons seem to point at the same direction,

205
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,160
 which is that we need to become more spiritually alert

206
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,360
 in sexual temptation matters.

207
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 And how do we, how can we do that?

208
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,960
 Well, for example, I mean,

209
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,360
 it's quite hot now in summers, right?

210
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,160
 And it's easy for us ladies to want to be in our tank tops,

211
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,760
 shorts and mini skirts, and even like tight clothings.

212
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,960
 And as innocent as it may be,

213
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,960
 the truth be told, it does open a small door

214
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,560
 for some people to fall into a temptation.

215
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,760
 And we might unknowingly become a victim.

216
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,760
 And if we're still single, for those who are,

217
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,160
 I mean, we don't want to be attracting the wrong kind of man, right?

218
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,560
 So we'll definitely become a victim of the wrong kind of man.

219
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,960
 Or so we need to learn how to protect ourselves.

220
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,760
 Now in similar ways for those who are married,

221
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,560
 or who are dating and having this one-on-one meeting

222
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,160
 with the opposite gender,

223
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,560
 may also open doors to possible affairs and other relationships.

224
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,760
 So as innocent as some of them might start off,

225
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,760
 if one or both of them are struggling with their current relationship,

226
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,560
 it's very easy that we'll slip out a line or two,

227
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,760
 "Oh, things are not working out, it's going bad,"

228
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,160
 and the other person will kindly comfort you.

229
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,160
 And so that could lead us into sexual immorality as well.

230
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,560
 Or if you're dating, it's easy to be in a private room

231
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,360
 where it's just the two of you,

232
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,360
 and also easy to become a victim,

233
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,760
 or be a stumbling block to someone.

234
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,560
 And there are many other ways that we can think of

235
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,960
 where we could protect ourselves better

236
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,960
 so that we don't become a victim accidentally,

237
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,160
 or like this, it might be just an innocent situation.

238
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,360
 Now I once dated, I mean, yes, I once dated,

239
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,760
 a long-distance boyfriend who was a pastor-to-be,

240
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,160
 and he was interning at a church in his last year.

241
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,960
 And one time he told me he's celebrating a birthday dinner

242
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,360
 with a lady who was in her 50s,

243
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,560
 and the lady had two children already in their 20s.

244
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,160
 So even though I thought, you know, it's a little bit odd

245
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,360
 that it's a one-on-one kind of celebration,

246
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,160
 I wasn't very comfortable, but I just thought to myself,

247
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,760
 "Well, what are the chances that something would happen?"

248
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,960
 So I just kind of brushed it off.

249
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,360
 So after a few months,

250
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,360
 I had discovered that they had sexual relations.

251
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,160
 And eventually, I broke it off.

252
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,160
 I mean, I was shocked in every way,

253
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,360
 just because of who he was about to be,

254
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,360
 and also the fact that I've already quit my job at that time,

255
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,160
 and I was planning or already purchased a ticket to go there

256
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,360
 so that we would date in person.

257
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,560
 And so ever since then,

258
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,960
 my spiritual awareness for sexual temptations had heightened,

259
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,360
 and I would take it to the highest caution in this area.

260
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,760
 And whenever now, when I catch myself saying,

261
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,160
 "Well, what are the chances of that happening?"

262
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,360
 I would just say, "All right, let me just pause and let me re-evaluate.

263
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,360
 Is there more that I could do

264
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
 so that I don't become a victim

265
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,560
 or I don't become a stumbling block for someone?"

266
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,160
 And if there is, I wanted to take it to the highest level,

267
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,960
 just like Uriah right here.

268
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,760
 He wasn't thinking about all this.

269
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,760
 He just wanted his devotion to God.

270
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,960
 And I think in the same way,

271
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,960
 we need to have this kind of devotion to God

272
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,560
 in sexual temptation or these matters.

273
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,760
 Now, I want to kind of sidetrack a little bit

274
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,560
 because it's a very, very good point,

275
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,960
 is that, well, after Bathsheba was pregnant

276
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
 and she gave birth to a son,

277
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
 God had to put him to death

278
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,160
 because David did what was evil in God's eyes.

279
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,360
 And after David repented,

280
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,560
 he made love to Bathsheba again.

281
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,760
 Now, this time she was his wife.

282
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,560
 And she had given birth, and the son is called?

283
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
 Solomon, that's correct.

284
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,760
 You guys get another point, so that's two points for you guys.

285
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,960
 And the Lord loved him.

286
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,360
 And he would become the successor of King David.

287
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,560
 Now, I just want to pause here.

288
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
 I just want to emphasize

289
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,360
 that when the Lord said he would blot out our sins,

290
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,960
 he really means it.

291
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,760
 I mean, sometimes I would think about, you know,

292
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
 if I were God, of course I would never be,

293
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,560
 but if I were, you know, of all of the wives that David has,

294
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,360
 I would not choose Bathsheba to be the next king.

295
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,160
 Not the next king, but the mother of the next king.

296
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,760
 I would choose anybody but her.

297
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,760
 But it just shows to see how merciful our God is.

298
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,760
 And when he says he forgives, he really forgives.

299
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,360
 And so if there's any one of us here, you know,

300
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,160
 who's struggling with something that we've committed before,

301
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,360
 and we feel like we're sinful even after you've repented,

302
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
 well, please go back to the story

303
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,760
 and just see how merciful and forgiving God is.

304
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,960
 So now let us continue.

305
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,960
 Now, as we read on, Bathsheba reappears now

306
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,560
 in 1 King 1, where King David was dying.

307
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,760
 And the next in line on the throne is,

308
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,160
 I won't ask you this one, this one's kind of hard,

309
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,960
 is Adon--oh, how do I pronounce?

310
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
 Adonisia, Adonisia, yeah.

311
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,160
 I try to memorize it a few times.

312
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,760
 So by default, he would be the next king

313
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,560
 if King David didn't do anything,

314
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,160
 because he was the next in line.

315
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,360
 So he was gathering his supporters and saying,

316
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,160
 "Come, you know, I will be the next king."

317
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,960
 But some people didn't join,

318
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,360
 and he was going to do it in a way that would make him official

319
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,160
 by sacrificing animals and having him anointed by someone.

320
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,760
 So here is the account in verse 11.

321
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,960
 Oh, this is when Nathan went to Bathsheba

322
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,160
 after these has happened.

323
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,160
 And Nathan asked Bathsheba, Solomon's mother,

324
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,760
 "Have you not heard that Adonisia, the son of Haggith,

325
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,960
 has become king, and our Lord David knows nothing about it?"

326
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,560
 Remember, David's now old and dying on his bed.

327
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,760
 "And now then, let me advise you.

328
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:17,760
 How can you save your own life and the life of your son Solomon?"

329
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,560
 So Bathsheba followed Nathan's instruction.

330
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,560
 He goes to the king and tells him about it.

331
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,960
 And Nathan said that he would appear in the middle of the conversation

332
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,560
 so that he could also tell the king what has been happening.

333
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,960
 And so Bathsheba did just that.

334
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,960
 And this is a chart that I want to show you.

335
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,360
 Okay, so on the left side,

336
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,760
 those are the things that Nathan told Bathsheba to say.

337
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,760
 And on the right hand side was all that Bathsheba said.

338
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,760
 And so the yellow highlights are all the extra pieces of information

339
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,760
 that she has given.

340
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,560
 So while they were still talking, Nathan appeared as promised.

341
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,360
 And King David put an order for Solomon to be king

342
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,560
 by riding on his mule, which represented that his throne is given to him,

343
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,360
 and to be anointed by Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet

344
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
 as king over Israel.

345
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,360
 Now, so from these texts, I know it's hard to see these texts,

346
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,360
 but from what we've just talked about,

347
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,760
 I mean, what can we tell about Bathsheba?

348
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,360
 All right, this is another question for a point.

349
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,960
 Was she clueless about what was going on before Nathan went to her?

350
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,560
 Was she clueless?

351
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,160
 If she is clueless, put up your hand.

352
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,160
 Okay, nobody put up.

353
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,960
 If she's not clueless, put up your hand.

354
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,760
 Oh, there, a few of you guys got a point.

355
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,560
 There you go.

356
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,560
 And the ones that you did not put up, well, I think you were still thinking about it.

357
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,160
 And yes, and you are correct for those that put your hands up.

358
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,960
 Well, because she was able to give so much more information,

359
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,760
 it meant that she was actually following the entire process

360
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,760
 and what had been happening with Edenesia.

361
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,760
 Now, why is this piece of information important?

362
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,960
 Well, because it showed that even though she knew all along

363
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,360
 that King David and God wanted Solomon to be the next king,

364
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,360
 she did nothing about it until prophet Nathan went to her.

365
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,560
 So what we see is that prophet Nathan was very clear

366
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,760
 about what God was doing.

367
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,960
 Not only did he not mingle with Edenesia,

368
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,360
 but he actually went to advise Bathsheba.

369
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,960
 She's like, "Bathsheba, don't you know this?

370
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,360
 Go to the king."

371
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,160
 So he took active action in what was God's will,

372
00:17:52,160 --> 00:18:00,360
 unlike Bathsheba, who her spiritual alertness was a lot slower.

373
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,160
 So now this brings us to our second point.

374
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,760
 What we can learn from Bathsheba is that we need to be

375
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,760
 spiritually alert for God's will.

376
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,760
 Now, even if all the guards of David and all the officials,

377
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,360
 even if they didn't say one word,

378
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,360
 but who was Bathsheba at that time?

379
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,560
 The wife of David.

380
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,360
 So he should have gone and told him,

381
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,560
 "Oh my goodness, this is all that's happening.

382
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,960
 Do something about it."

383
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,760
 But she didn't.

384
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,160
 Rather, it was for fear to be in front of a king,

385
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,360
 which doesn't seem to be in here.

386
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,960
 We don't know.

387
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,960
 But if prophet Nathan had not appeared and advised her,

388
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,760
 it seemed like she wouldn't have done anything.

389
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,560
 And sometimes, aren't we like Bathsheba as well?

390
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,960
 It's like we have received and we kind of know what God wants us to do.

391
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,360
 But for one thing or another, we're like, "Oh, you know, maybe I won't do it.

392
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,960
 Maybe I'll do it next week or next year."

393
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,560
 And we just kind of brush it off and we don't even pay attention to it.

394
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,960
 But we could instead be like Nathan,

395
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,760
 taking charge and going forward,

396
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,760
 even strategizing.

397
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,360
 For him, Nathan actually went to Bathsheba first before going to King David,

398
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,360
 because he wanted to be going into God's will.

399
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,560
 Now, going back to my earlier sharing about the ex-boyfriend.

400
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,160
 Now, at that time, I was going to leave Hong Kong, right?

401
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,160
 Because that's where my ex-boyfriend was.

402
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,960
 Well, I was actually studying seminary already at that time.

403
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,760
 And even though my calling wasn't 100% clear yet,

404
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,760
 but I knew God had put a passion in me to preach and to teach.

405
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,160
 But I just thought, "Well, you know what? I don't really need to be a pastor.

406
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,560
 Maybe I can be a pastor's wife. That sounds pretty good."

407
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,760
 And I can be flipping burgers for fellowship meetings.

408
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,960
 That sounds a lot better than going up on stage

409
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,160
 and having to struggle through the sermon, right?

410
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,560
 Sounds pretty good.

411
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:22,360
 But I was really glad that God had put a pause in what I thought,

412
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,560
 even though I knew and God put the passion in my heart.

413
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,360
 And I was even into seminary,

414
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,560
 that I was going to skew away from what I believe is God's calling

415
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,360
 and His direction for me.

416
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,160
 And so I just felt like I was spiritually slow in following God.

417
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,360
 But if I had been like Nathan,

418
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,560
 I would have been clear with my direction

419
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,760
 and I would have continued with what I believe God was putting in my heart.

420
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,560
 And it might be the same with us.

421
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,560
 I mean, are we aware of what God is doing in our lives at time?

422
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,760
 I mean, why has God put you in your company

423
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,960
 or put you in the relationship that you're in?

424
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,760
 I mean, why does God allow you to meet some of maybe the top guns in Hong Kong?

425
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:21,360
 Or why does God allow you to meet the poorest of the country, of our city?

426
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,560
 And what is it that God wants us to do?

427
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,960
 And if we have that spiritual alertness,

428
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,160
 we would actually go forward with what it is that He's telling us.

429
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,760
 So now let us read on.

430
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,360
 In the next chapter is 1st King, chapter 2.

431
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,960
 So after Solomon has become king,

432
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,360
 Adonijah went to Bathsheba to ask for the hand of Abishag.

433
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,760
 You're like, who is this?

434
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,160
 So this was the lady or the known as the concubine

435
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,960
 who was serving King David when he was dying.

436
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,760
 And even though they never had sexual relations,

437
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,160
 but to the outsider, she was the concubine.

438
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,360
 And so in this account, let's read, I will read it to you.

439
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,760
 In verse 13, Bathsheba asked him, which is Adonijah,

440
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,560
 "Do you come peacefully?"

441
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,560
 He answered, "Yes, peacefully."

442
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,560
 Then he added, "I have something to say to you."

443
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,960
 "You may say it," she replied.

444
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,960
 "As you know," he said, "the kingdom was mine.

445
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,160
 All Israel looked to me as their king, but things have changed.

446
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,760
 And the kingdom has now gone to my brother,

447
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,560
 for it has come from him, from the Lord.

448
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,360
 Now I have one request to make to you.

449
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,360
 Do not refuse me. You may make it," she says.

450
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,360
 So he continued, "Please ask King Solomon.

451
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,360
 He will not refuse you to give me Abishag,

452
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,160
 the Sunamite, as my wife."

453
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
 "Very well," Bathsheba replied.

454
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,160
 "I will speak to the king for you."

455
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,560
 So she goes to King Solomon and asks accordingly,

456
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,360
 just like Adonijah's request.

457
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,960
 But she kind of used her own way.

458
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,560
 So how she did it is in verse 20.

459
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,360
 You know, it goes to King Solomon,

460
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,160
 "I have just this one small request to make to you."

461
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
 So she says, "Do not refuse me."

462
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,160
 And the king, before knowing what it is, says,

463
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,560
 "Make it, my mother. I will not refuse you."

464
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,160
 And so she requests for Abishag,

465
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,560
 which to be married to Adonijah.

466
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,360
 Wow, these names are really hard to read.

467
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,560
 King Solomon responded harshly.

468
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,560
 He said to her, "Well, isn't that equivalent

469
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,360
 to giving him my entire kingdom?"

470
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,960
 Now, as such, Solomon put Adonijah to death on that day.

471
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,360
 Now at first, clans would be like, "What? Why?

472
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,760
 You're just asking for a concubine.

473
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,960
 Like, why do you have to put him to death and all this?"

474
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,160
 Well, actually, in the ancient world,

475
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:11,160
 Adonijah's request to marry Abishag was actually a revolt.

476
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,560
 Because to be seen with the king's concubine

477
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,360
 meant that he had already obtained political control.

478
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,560
 And so if it actually happens,

479
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,160
 then the rivals for all of King Solomon

480
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,760
 would come against him and challenge the king.

481
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,560
 And so what we see is that

482
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,560
 Bathsheba was insensitive to the political situation.

483
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,360
 She bought into Adonijah's word that he came in peace.

484
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,160
 And she believed his words when he called Solomon,

485
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,760
 "Oh, he's my king, the brother."

486
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,560
 Oh, and he even acknowledged that all of this happened because of God.

487
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,160
 And so, because he had been plotting this throne

488
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,360
 since the last chapter,

489
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,560
 she should have known better

490
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,360
 that whatever this guy is up to is probably not a good thing.

491
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,560
 And she should have taken a grain of salt,

492
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:14,560
 or even consult with Solomon,

493
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,560
 or even the prophet before taking action.

494
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,960
 And she had no obligation, right?

495
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,560
 To say yes to his request.

496
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,760
 And yet she does.

497
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,960
 So on the contrary, what do we see

498
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,160
 is that Solomon instead displayed a kind of discernment

499
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,560
 that Bathsheba lacked.

500
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,360
 I mean, even though he has agreed and said,

501
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,160
 "Okay, yes, I will agree to everything,

502
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,160
 or I will not refuse you."

503
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
 But at this critical moment,

504
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,360
 knowing that he'll have to give up his entire kingdom,

505
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,560
 he actually put a pause and said, "No, I cannot."

506
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,560
 And of course, the mother is kind of tricking him into it,

507
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,360
 because she said a small request.

508
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,360
 But this was not a small request.

509
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,760
 And so what we see is that Solomon displayed

510
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,160
 a spiritual alertness to discern.

511
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,160
 And so this would bring us to our third point,

512
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,560
 which is we can learn from Bathsheba

513
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:19,160
 that we need to be spiritually alert to discern.

514
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,560
 Now, she obviously lacked discernment

515
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,160
 about Adonijah's intention and mistaken it

516
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,960
 he had come in peace.

517
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,360
 She did not use her power wisely,

518
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,360
 but she kind of tricked her son

519
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,760
 and wanted him to agree with what she wanted.

520
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,560
 And so this might be very similar to us.

521
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,160
 I mean, sometimes we might lack discernment as well.

522
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,360
 I mean, some people can come to us saying,

523
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,960
 "Yes, I am a good person."

524
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,160
 I don't actually hear people say that,

525
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,360
 but they display it this way.

526
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,560
 Or they might actually display that,

527
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,960
 "Oh, you need to date a Christian?

528
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,960
 I'm a Christian," you know, and make that claim.

529
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,360
 And we need to be discerning.

530
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,760
 And also, maybe we have these businessmen

531
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,360
 that we need to work with,

532
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
 and they could display themselves

533
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,360
 as someone who's fair and doing good,

534
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,960
 but in fact, they're not.

535
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,560
 And so going back to my earlier experience that I shared,

536
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,360
 now, even after I realized that my ex-boyfriend

537
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,760
 had sexual relations with the older lady

538
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,560
 and to a point where police was involved,

539
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,760
 now, I still thought about staying with him

540
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,760
 because I thought, "Well, isn't that what the Bible said?

541
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,960
 Like, to love, to forgive?"

542
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,760
 And it wasn't until my mom,

543
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,960
 when I was talking to her on the phone about this,

544
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,360
 and she literally yelled at me, saying,

545
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,160
 "Will you just stop doing things your way?"

546
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,960
 And I still remember, you know, holding that phone.

547
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,760
 I'm like, "Ah, I'm going to press that button

548
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,360
 and cut your line," you know?

549
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,760
 You know how we are when we're mad at our mothers, right?

550
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,560
 Cut.

551
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,960
 Well, they do the same thing when they're mad at you, right?

552
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,160
 So that's what I did.

553
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,760
 I was like, "Well, what do you know?"

554
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,960
 However, you know, that --

555
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,760
 her voice, that sentence kept on ringing back.

556
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,960
 And I just -- I just started to think,

557
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,560
 and I really thank God for opening

558
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,760
 my spiritual discernment and awareness

559
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,760
 because she wasn't talking about what I was thinking.

560
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,360
 She was thinking about the integrity of this person

561
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,360
 certainly has problems,

562
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,160
 and you need to choose correctly.

563
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,160
 And so, as I was thinking, you know,

564
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,960
 I just thought about how much my mother loves me.

565
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,760
 She always wanted the best for me,

566
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,360
 and God has placed her around me

567
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,360
 to guard me and to support me and to bless me.

568
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,160
 So I listened to her.

569
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,560
 And three months after I broke up with him,

570
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,160
 when all the emotions subsided, all the infatuations,

571
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,560
 and I just want to say,

572
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,160
 that was the best decision I've ever made.

573
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,760
 Of course, the best one is probably getting married with Philemon,

574
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,360
 but actually --

575
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,160
 actually, the best one might be believing in God, okay?

576
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,960
 So anyways, it's top there, you know,

577
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,960
 top three, top five decisions.

578
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,760
 And we may have spiritual blindness ourselves at times, don't we?

579
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,160
 And it's important for us to keep our ears open,

580
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:32,160
 especially to opposing voices.

581
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,360
 And if those opposing voices come from your loved ones,

582
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,760
 like your parents, your sons, your daughters,

583
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,560
 your best friends, your mentors, take those.

584
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,160
 I mean, I'm not saying just blindly take them,

585
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,160
 but really slow down, think about it, evaluate it.

586
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,160
 If you're not sure and you're having emotional, you know,

587
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,760
 hard time with it, speak with someone else,

588
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,760
 pray together about it.

589
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,960
 Because a lot of times we do have spiritual blindness

590
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,360
 and we might not have the discernment,

591
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,760
 just like Bathsheba.

592
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,560
 But God is gracious.

593
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,960
 He will put people around us, just like Solomon, you know,

594
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,760
 he would come in and say, "This is the right thing to do."

595
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,360
 And so in conclusion today, I just wanted to say

596
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,360
 that we need to learn Bathsheba's story.

597
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,160
 Is that we need to live a life with spiritual alertness.

598
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,760
 Now you might think in your head,

599
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,960
 "Well, you know, even though she didn't have it,

600
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,960
 she did end up to be the wife of King David.

601
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,960
 And also she was the mother, Queen Mother of Solomon."

602
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,560
 And actually it doesn't seem so bad, you know,

603
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,360
 maybe like we're secretly like envying her, right?

604
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,760
 But that would only be true if we're focused on the temporal.

605
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,960
 I mean, if I have to stretch that, well,

606
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,560
 then I might as well lie and cheat and seduce

607
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,360
 to get our ways up, right?

608
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,560
 Of course, I'm not saying Bathsheba was like that,

609
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,760
 but I mean, if I have to stretch that point.

610
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,560
 Now, if we're looking,

611
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,360
 and I'm sure we are since we're sitting here today

612
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,360
 and also online, is that we are looking

613
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,960
 for matters in the eternal.

614
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,360
 And God will remember us when we do things His way

615
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,160
 in faith in Him.

616
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,360
 And I want to share that in Matthew chapter one,

617
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,960
 where the genealogy of Jesus was listed,

618
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,360
 starting from Abraham and the list down.

619
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,760
 And in verse five and six,

620
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,160
 if I highlighted these two verses, it says,

621
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,360
 "Salmon," not the swimming salmon, but the guy salmon,

622
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,160
 "the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab,

623
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,160
 Boaz, the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth,

624
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,760
 Obed, the father of Jesse,

625
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,760
 and Jesse, the father of King David.

626
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,360
 David was the father of Solomon," notice here,

627
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:08,360
 "whose mother had been Uriah's wife."

628
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:15,160
 Notice that Bathsheba, her name nor her work was recorded.

629
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,960
 Now we might say, well, you know, she had a husband before.

630
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,960
 Well, so did Ruth.

631
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,360
 And actually Rahab had probably more than one man in her life.

632
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:34,160
 But notice that their names was remembered in eternity by God.

633
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:41,360
 And so it matters to us that we just live our greatest devotion to God.

634
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,160
 And if we want to be remembered by God as well,

635
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,960
 now I'm not saying that God would love us any less

636
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,560
 because just like the songs that we sang, we know how much God loves us.

637
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,960
 But this is a matter of devoting ourselves to the highest level

638
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,360
 for the God that deserves it

639
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,360
 and for the one God that we love.

640
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,960
 And so from Bathsheba, how can we have spiritual awareness that honors God?

641
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,360
 Well, first, it is to safeguard ourselves from sexual temptations.

642
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,360
 So when the Holy Spirit speaks to us,

643
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,960
 I use this, but it probably doesn't happen like this.

644
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,160
 But when the Holy Spirit speaks to us about how we should dress,

645
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:30,360
 who we should not be alone with, or how to talk to the opposite sex,

646
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,760
 would we uphold the highest standard like Uriah to safeguard ourselves

647
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,760
 so we don't become a victim and we don't become a stumbling block

648
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,360
 so that we could honor God that way?

649
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,560
 And secondly, in the area of following God's will,

650
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,760
 and when the Holy Spirit, I'm doing this again,

651
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,360
 the Holy Spirit reminds us of what He's doing in our lives.

652
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,960
 You know, rather it's full-time ministry or to be salt and light in your workplace

653
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:08,760
 or leading, or actually volunteering at church or spreading the gospel.

654
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,160
 Would we then just follow that lead, just like Prophet Nathan,

655
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,960
 acting in the will of God?

656
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,760
 And thirdly, in the area of spiritual discernment,

657
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,960
 maybe Holy Spirit reminds us of our blindness, our stubbornness,

658
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,760
 or us wanting our own ways,

659
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:35,560
 but He might put people around us to remind us.

660
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:41,960
 Would we stop for a moment and listen, evaluate, pray over them,

661
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,560
 and listen to what God wants us to do?

662
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,760
 And we can choose to be spiritually alert,

663
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,960
 or we can just live our life randomly.

664
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,360
 And I pray that it would be all of us who will live

665
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:03,560
 just the highest devotion for our God, because He's worthy of it all.

666
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,560
 So let Holy Spirit continue to guide us in these three areas.

667
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,560
 And really, today if there was any part that for a moment

668
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,160
 it was like speaking to you and you're like, "Nah, it's probably not me,"

669
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,760
 or, "What are the chances?"

670
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,360
 I hope that you would just take a moment to pray over it,

671
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,960
 especially with someone that you trust,

672
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,560
 to really seek and see if God is saying something to you.

673
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,360
 So let's respond with our hearts,

674
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,960
 and we pray that God's Spirit would open our eyes

675
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,960
 so that our spiritual blindness will be teared down

676
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
 and that we can have the awareness.

677
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,760
 We pray that God's presence would fill us to change us.

678
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,360
 So let's pray together.

679
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:04,760
 Dear Heavenly Father, we pray with all our hearts

680
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:13,160
 that our lives would just not wander away and just let it pass by.

681
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,160
 We pray, dear Heavenly Father, that we would give you the highest devotion,

682
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,760
 that we would safeguard ourselves from sexual matters,

683
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,360
 that we will follow your will,

684
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,560
 and that we would have discernment in all that we do, Father.

685
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,760
 We pray that your Holy Spirit would give us spiritual alertness and awareness

686
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,960
 so that everything that we do

687
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,360
 would be the most God-honoring action and words that we say.

688
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:50,160
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
