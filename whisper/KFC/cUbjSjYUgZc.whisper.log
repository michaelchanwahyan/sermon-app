[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   It's a joy to be able to bring you the Word today.
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.040]   And we are so missing everyone, just being able to gather.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.640]   And we are really, really close now.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.480]   We're praying that in these coming weeks,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.600]   we will have a chance to just be together again.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.800]   Today, I want to be talking about how we cross generations.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.360]   You know, coming to Hong Kong,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.240]   one of the biggest inspirations for me
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.560]   has been meeting Pastor John and Pastor Peter,
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.760]   who have this vision to embrace this next generation.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.640]   And this last year,
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.200]   the next generation have had a torch shone on them,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.720]   because the next generation are showing some of the feelings
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.480]   or the frustrations they have about their future.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.440]   And we know that the next generation
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.800]   that is coming up in Hong Kong
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.400]   is in deep need of the gospel,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.200]   in deep need of hope
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.320]   and being told that everything is going to be okay.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.920]   And so for us as a church,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.280]   the question really remains is,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.320]   how do we serve this next generation?
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.240]   How do we cross generations in our ministries?
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.800]   And in my work with Young Life now,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.960]   that is what it's all about.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.240]   How do we introduce the next generation to Jesus Christ?
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.360]   And then for a parachurch,
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.680]   how do we work together with the church,
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.680]   all being a part of the body of Christ
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.680]   in solving this problem?
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.640]   For me, as we talk about how to cross generations,
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.240]   the first thing we need to think about is,
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.960]   before we even get to the solution,
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.560]   we first need to understand the problem.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.480]   And the problem is this,
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.360]   there is difficulty with doing next generation work,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.520]   because there is such a thing as a generation gap.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.760]   The generation gap is there
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.760]   is because generations are simply different.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.920]   And they've always been different
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.960]   since the beginning of mankind,
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.000]   but they've been even more amplified now
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.320]   because of technology, because of globalization.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.040]   So what we have now are generations are becoming so divided
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.560]   in their way of thinking and their way of acting.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.600]   For example, we have a generation called the baby boomers
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.600]   who are on the whole born in between the 40s and the 60s.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.160]   A lot of the current society's leaders
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.560]   are part of this generation.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.080]   And this generation, the baby boomers,
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.320]   they come from a time where things
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.760]   were not so good in Hong Kong,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.280]   when Hong Kong was still making small steps
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.360]   into becoming this big city that it is right now.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.400]   But these baby boomers have something very interesting
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.080]   is that in this kind of maybe poorer beginning,
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.040]   they have learned to get it done.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.480]   They are called the get it done generation.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.560]   They work hard.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.040]   The mantra of this generation is survival and community.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.680]   Things were tough, so it's all about surviving.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.600]   It's all about function.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.160]   It's all about efficiency.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.840]   And it's all about community, sticking together.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.200]   So they would trust leadership.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.600]   They would trust authority.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.360]   They would put their trust in establishments.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.760]   So that's the baby boomers.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.000]   And then from the baby boomers,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.520]   you move into what they call the Gen X.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.240]   And this is actually only a very small decade.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.600]   It fits snugly in between the baby boomers
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.440]   and the millennials.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.080]   And these guys have started to learn
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.000]   to become a bit more independent.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.480]   They're a bit more ambitious
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.240]   because their parents have maybe paved the way for them.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.720]   And then you reach this big group,
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.800]   which is the millennials,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.920]   born in the '70s all the way up to the '90s.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.120]   And this group are very different from the baby boomers.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.680]   If the baby boomers were about survival and community,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.040]   the millennials are about authenticity and vulnerability.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.880]   They're about finding their own identity,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.120]   their own calling.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.200]   It's a lot more about feeling.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.480]   It's a lot more about their own personal ambitions.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.120]   They don't trust establishments as much.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.720]   They don't trust institutions.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.160]   Their trust in leadership is not the same
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.000]   as the baby boomers.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.520]   And their language is different.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.880]   If the baby boomers were more about honoring and respecting,
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.720]   the heart's cry of a millennial
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.240]   is to be listened to and to be loved.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.680]   And so even between these few generations,
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.440]   you see there are differences.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.360]   And then you go further now into Gen Z,
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.960]   and the next one's called Alpha,
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.000]   which is the last decade.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.200]   And these children are born into a society
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.160]   where technology is at their fingertips.
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.520]   They are used to talking more to Alexa
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.840]   than to their friends.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.480]   They are used to using smartphones and smart devices,
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.040]   and they are in a completely different generation as well.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.640]   So the question is this.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.000]   How does a church do cross-generational work
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.080]   in a way that is able to kind of serve
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.960]   all the different generations?
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.920]   It is not an easy task,
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.880]   and I'm not gonna be able to give you the answer
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.240]   even within this sermon.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.480]   But as I look through scripture,
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.600]   as I look through the word of God,
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.840]   there are some principles that I've found
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.560]   that are so key, so key,
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.040]   for the body of Christ to be remembering
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   as we head into generation, cross-generational work.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.640]   And I'll share three of them with you today.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.200]   The first one is this.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.400]   Whilst we're doing cross-generational work,
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.000]   the first thing we have to remember
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.280]   is that the church exists for all generations.
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.360]   There's a quote that I really love, and it says this.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.080]   There is a human tendency for each generation
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.600]   to believe and act as though the church exists for them.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.040]   There is a human tendency for each generation
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.400]   to buy into the idea that the church was built for them,
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.280]   so everything is about them.
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.480]   The worship is tailored to their musical preferences.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.080]   The sermons are preached in a style that is good for them.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.720]   And when it's not, they get upset.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.280]   The first key to doing cross-generational ministry
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.080]   is to remind everyone that we are all
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.760]   part of this generation.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.400]   The people that are on this planet right now,
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.680]   the people that are in our churches right now
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.880]   are all part of this generation,
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.600]   and we are all different parts of the body of Christ.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.480]   1 Corinthians 12 talks about this,
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.000]   that there are different parts to the body,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.160]   and I believe that is the same
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.760]   for the different generations.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.800]   The diversity there is what makes it beautiful.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.920]   Maybe someone in a generation who really values honour
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.920]   and respect and authority has so much good to bring
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.840]   to a church community, just as much as someone
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.000]   who maybe values more ambition
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.360]   and individuality and creativity.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.080]   We all bring different parts to the body of Christ.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.720]   We need to remember that all generations are part of this.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   You see, the problem is if you just focus on one generation,
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.920]   there's two real dangers that happen.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.520]   One is the generation that you're targeting
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.320]   ends up thinking that this is all about them,
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.440]   and the other is the generations that you're not targeting
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.040]   feel neglected, feel left out.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.880]   But if the church, imagine a church where people
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.880]   of all ages embrace the mission to serve each other
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.040]   regardless of age, bringing what they have,
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.440]   their experiences, their upbringing, their personalities,
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.400]   bringing it into the body of Christ,
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.240]   and allowing God to create this masterpiece, this mosaic,
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.720]   that includes all the different generations,
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.120]   that is the first key.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.600]   We are all in this together.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.960]   There is no next generation and previous generation.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.800]   We are all this generation.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.000]   That's number one.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.760]   Number two is this.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.760]   In that diversity, unity is only achieved through humility.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.400]   Humility is the key.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.320]   Now, what does that look like?
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.400]   Because when we have so many people
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.080]   from so many different ages,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.160]   their diversity is incredible.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.840]   The only way we can get everyone together
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.280]   and to stay together is if everyone remains humble,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.360]   if everyone is open to the other's differences,
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.600]   to the other's preferences.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.360]   Philippians 2 talks about this.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.480]   Paul says, "If you have any encouragement in Christ,
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.400]   "if there's any participation in the Spirit,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.520]   "be of the same mind, the same love, be of one accord.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.840]   "Consider others more significant than yourselves.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.440]   "Put their interests first."
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.320]   What does this look like?
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.920]   It looks like someone from one generation
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.760]   going to another saying,
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.080]   "Hey, this isn't really my musical style,
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.560]   "but I know it's your jam,
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.760]   "and I'm willing to go with it,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.520]   "and I'm willing to follow it because I love you.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.320]   "Because I love you, I want to put your interests above mine."
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.640]   And then it's the other person saying,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.960]   "Look, I don't like this kind of style of preaching,
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.760]   "but I know that it speaks to you.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.200]   "I'm willing to accommodate this
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.840]   "and have this within our church
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.520]   "because I want to build up the body of Christ as one."
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.920]   It's humility.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.920]   You see, if we want true unity, there has to be diversity.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.680]   Now, Pastor John has said time and time again,
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.920]   if we are just all the same people just gathering together,
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.960]   that's not really unity, that's uniformity, all right?
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.080]   That's what he said.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.480]   If we want true unity, it's different people
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.000]   coming from different generations
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.600]   with different preferences all getting together.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.440]   And the only way it works is humility.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's someone looking across the aisle and saying,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.840]   "You are worth it.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.560]   "I love you just as I love myself,
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.280]   "and I'm willing to put you above me."
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.680]   That is the key, and that ties in with the first one.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.280]   It requires all generations to be humble.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.840]   It requires the people who are yearning and desiring
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.080]   to be listened to and loved.
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.320]   So also recognize that there are people here
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.080]   who actually, their way of expressing love
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.000]   is through honor and respect and provision.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.920]   And it just looks different.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.760]   It's being aware of the problem
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.000]   so we can find the solution together.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   We obtain unity despite diversity through humility.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.800]   And the final one is this,
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.520]   and this is where I wanna dive a little bit
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.680]   into the scripture as we talk about this.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.760]   If we are to really want to do cross-generational work,
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.640]   the key thing here, and this final point is this,
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   we must, we must invest and empower young leaders.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.320]   We must.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.520]   You see, there's this tendency in our culture here
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.280]   which is a very autocratic, hierarchical culture
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.320]   where you have to earn the right to be heard
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.240]   and you have to essentially do your time
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.440]   before you become a leader.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.480]   But the problem is if we want to do cross-generational work,
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.520]   we need to pick out some of the young leaders,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.120]   the young promising leaders now,
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.320]   and invest in them and empower them,
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.120]   and also to take a risk on them.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.280]   We've all been there where we're trying
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.440]   to teach someone younger than us something,
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.520]   and they're just not doing it as well as we can,
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.720]   so we end up doing it for them
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.000]   and we don't let them do it.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.360]   But then they don't learn.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.440]   And by the time they do learn, it's too late.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.320]   They're disillusioned, they're frustrated,
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.160]   their gift has gone to waste.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.520]   If we are to do effective cross-generational work,
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.160]   we have to identify, invest,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.120]   and empower these young leaders now.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.880]   And a great example of this is in scripture.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.240]   It's in the man Timothy.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.800]   See, Timothy, we all hear about,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.560]   as maybe the most famous passage,
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.320]   is the one that Paul writes to Timothy
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.520]   as a mentor writing to a mentee,
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.440]   and saying, you know, 1 Timothy 4, 12,
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.520]   don't let anyone look down on you,
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.000]   because you are young.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.440]   Set an example.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.920]   And so we know that Timothy was a church leader
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.440]   who was relatively young,
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.600]   maybe in his 30s when he was leading a church
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.240]   when Paul was writing to him about this.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.960]   But if you rewind even further,
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.520]   if you rewind the story all to the time
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.480]   where Paul first meets Timothy,
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.040]   I find some really interesting things that happen.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.680]   In Acts 16, Paul goes on his missionary journey.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.320]   He goes to Derbe, and he goes to Lystra.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.760]   And when he reaches there,
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.880]   he meets this young man called Timothy,
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.560]   who was likely just a teenager at the time.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.440]   Timothy was extremely interesting.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.000]   He was the first second-generation Christian.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.200]   He was also bicultural.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.640]   His mother, Eunice, was a Jew.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.600]   His father was a Greek.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.560]   And what happens in those first few verses in Acts 16
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.760]   is we see Paul meeting this young man,
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.360]   this young teenager, this boy, Timothy.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.560]   And Timothy had a good reputation.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.040]   That's what it says in the scripture there,
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.800]   that he was of good repute.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.360]   He was a "guai zhen."
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.600]   He was going to the church,
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.160]   and he was probably top of his Sunday school class,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   doing well, but he was still a young man nonetheless.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.520]   And then you have this apostle Paul coming in
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.480]   from a different place, reaching this little town.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   And from there, he identifies this young man, Timothy.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.960]   And then what does he do?
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.760]   He invests in him, and he empowers him.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.520]   He looks at this young man and says,
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.440]   "You come with me to minister together.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.000]   "You may be young in age, but I see something in you,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.240]   "and I want to take you with me.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.560]   "I want to take you under my wing and do this."
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.440]   That is what we need to do.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.560]   We need to look at some of the young people,
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.480]   and we need to say, "How can I invest in you?
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.840]   "How can I pave the way for you
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.240]   "so that you can become an effective minister,
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.400]   "a devoted believer and follower of Christ in your own right?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.280]   "How can I let you start making decisions?
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.120]   "How can I let you make mistakes yourself
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.880]   "so you can learn from them?"
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.480]   It's willing to give up this fear of making mistakes,
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.080]   a fear of looking bad, and fear of shame,
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.240]   but this is saying, "Hey, the next generation,
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.880]   "the young people are important,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.480]   "and if we're wanting to serve across the board,
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:55.520]   "we need leaders across the board."
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.960]   And you see, with Timothy, it's interesting.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.040]   It wasn't only the Apostle Paul and outside
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.680]   coming in to invest in him.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.320]   It was also his mother and grandmother.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.560]   In 2 Timothy 1.5, we see that.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.600]   Paul's writing to Timothy much later on now,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.400]   and he's saying, "I saw a sincere faith in you, Timothy,
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.320]   "that I first saw in your grandmother Lois
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.120]   "and your mother Eunice."
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.120]   So what we see here is that not only are church brothers
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.240]   and sisters, church leaders such as Paul,
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.120]   willing to invest in someone young like Timothy,
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.240]   but also it starts within the home
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.720]   that Timothy himself was invested to
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.400]   by his grandmother and his mother.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.120]   It takes a village to raise a child
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.720]   is the quote that we often hear.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.040]   It takes a whole church community to raise a leader.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.960]   We need to be committed to investing
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.200]   and empowering the young people
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.720]   because they are the ones that are gonna be the future
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.000]   of this city as well, but they won't survive
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.160]   and they won't do well if those of us
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:03.880]   who are more experienced, more mature,
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.120]   more wise, more weathered, they won't do well
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.880]   unless this group of people chooses to invest
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.480]   and pour into these people and to give them opportunities
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.000]   and to give them chances.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.920]   That is how we start doing cross-generational work.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.360]   And I truly believe that we are entering
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.560]   into a new norm in this city.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.400]   What we knew before may be changed
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.160]   when we come out of this pandemic
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.520]   and there are gonna be new ways
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.120]   and God we know is moving in this city
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.480]   in new and mysterious and beautiful ways.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.760]   My prayer, our prayer as a staff here
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.640]   is that our church, the body of Christ
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.960]   will be mobilised and will be committed
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.240]   to serving the people of all generations
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.760]   and being willing to follow God's guidance
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.280]   and his spirit in doing this.
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.280]   So my prayer to you, brother and sister,
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.920]   is as you receive this word, start thinking
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.400]   and start praying to God.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.360]   Who are the people that God has placed in your life,
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.760]   whether younger or older?
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.600]   Who are the people that he has placed in your life
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   who you can start reaching out to,
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.600]   who you can start investing into?
[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.920]   And remember, some of these people
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.360]   will make you feel uncomfortable.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.200]   Why?
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.160]   Because they're different.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.800]   They're younger, they're older,
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.000]   they have different backgrounds,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.840]   they're from a different class maybe.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.640]   But the goal here is if we're to do
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.960]   cross-generational ministry,
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:39.120]   we have to be willing to be comfortably uncomfortable
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.440]   because that is what Christ did for us,
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.320]   that he would leave heaven's throne,
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.440]   remove the comfort from himself,
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.280]   come into a world, become completely uncomfortable,
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.400]   and then to subject himself to death on the cross,
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.120]   to lay his life down for us and to die,
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.040]   but then to rise again so that we can identify
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.720]   with his death and his resurrection.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.400]   And if we truly believe that and if we truly do that,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.080]   we will then be onto a great start
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.760]   in how we lay our lives down for those in our church,
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.520]   regardless of age.
