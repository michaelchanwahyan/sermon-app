[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.560]   Good evening everyone. Welcome to KFCI online service. My name is Michelle and I serve as
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:17.600]   one of the pastors here. We're so glad that you've tuned in so that we can worship God
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.840]   together. Now today we're very excited because we are going to be listening to a sermon on
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.480]   how to cross the generations. Now many a times we do want to connect with people who are
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.320]   in different generations than we are, but we just don't know how. And yet we know that
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.240]   it is in God's heart for us to be united as one so that we can praise and worship Him
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:49.000]   together. Now before we get to that sermon, I do want to read for us from Psalm 145 verse
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.960]   1 to 5. So please follow along and see how God is speaking to you today. Psalm 145 verse
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:11.240]   1. I will exalt you, my God the King. I will praise your name forever and ever. Every day
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.960]   I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever. Great is the Lord and most worthy
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:29.480]   of praise. His greatness no one can fathom. One generation commands your works to another.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:38.760]   They tell of your mighty acts. They speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.640]   Now let us turn our hearts to worship Him with music and with songs.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:02:11.400]   [Music]
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:33.880]   Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come quickly,
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:03:01.880]   your will be done, on earth as it is. In heaven, let heaven come to earth as it is.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:11.880]   In heaven, let heaven come.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   [Music]
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   Let's sing our Father.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come quickly,
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:04:13.880]   your will be done, we sing on earth as it is. In heaven, let heaven come to earth as it is.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   In heaven, let heaven come.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:41.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   Let heaven come.

[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:43.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:51.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:59.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:13.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:21.880]   Let heaven come.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:49.880]   [Instrumental]
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.880]   God I look to you, I won't be overwhelmed.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:03.880]   Give me vision, to see things I could do.
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:09.880]   God I look to you, you're where my hope comes from.

[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.880]   God I look to you, you're where my hope comes from.

[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   Sing God I look to you.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.880]   God I look to you, I won't be overwhelmed.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:02.880]   Give me vision, to see things I could do.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.880]   God I look to you, you're where my hope comes from.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:30.880]   Give me wisdom, you know just what to do.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.880]   I will love you.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   I will love you Lord my strength.

[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:08.880]   I will love you Lord my strength.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   I will love you Lord my shield.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.880]   I will love you Lord my rock.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:28.880]   Forever all my days, I will love you God.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.880]   Hallelujah.

[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:51.880]   Forever all my days, hallelujah.
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.880]   I will love you.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   I will love you Lord my strength.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:10.880]   I will love you Lord my shield.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.880]   I will love you Lord my rock.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:23.880]   Forever all my days, I will love you God.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.880]   Let's sing to God I will love you.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:32.880]   I will love you Lord my strength.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:40.880]   I will love you Lord my shield.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:47.880]   I will love you Lord my rock.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:55.880]   Forever all my days, I will love you God.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:05.880]   Wow, that was a wonderful worship.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   And at this time I do want to share with you about some things that have been happening at KFCI.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.880]   And also some other events that I think you'll be very interested in.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   So now let us watch KFCI announcements together.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:33.880]   [Music]
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:44.880]   [Music]
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:54.880]   [Music]
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:04.880]   [Music]
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   [Music]
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.880]   [Alarm sound]
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:27.880]   [Music]
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:40.880]   [Music]
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   [Music]
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.880]   After a long day, do you feel empty and unfulfilled?
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.880]   There's more to life than this.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.880]   Come join us at Alpha as we discuss life questions.
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.880]   Why are we here?
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.880]   Is there more to life than this?
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.880]   Does God have a purpose for me?
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.880]   Come join us and we will discover more.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:10.880]   [Music]
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:17.880]   Fear and fear have creeped our city.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   As God's people, it is time to stand and fast for our city, our home, our people.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.880]   This is a spiritual battle.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.880]   The enemy wants to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.880]   But remember, our God is for us.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.880]   Our God is for us.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:44.880]   Let's stand to the gap of fasting and prayer to cover the city.
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.880]   Oh Lord, let faith arise.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.880]   Let faith arise.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   In Jesus' name.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.880]   [Music]
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.880]   As you've just heard from our announcements,
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   we do hope that you come and join Alpha and also for the fast.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.880]   Now, if you're new to our church or if you're visiting or haven't been connecting with us for some time,
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   please use this time to scan the QR code and also really to let us know how you're doing
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.880]   and how we can pray for you.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   And at the same time, once we've received your information,
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   we can reach out to you and give you some information about some upcoming events that are happening here.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.880]   At the same time, we're very hopeful that we can meet in person very soon.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.880]   So please watch for our latest update in our website.
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:47.880]   Now, at this time, we want to watch a video together in which we've interviewed a few people
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   to get out their thoughts on what bridging the generations look like.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.880]   Hello, church. We're here at KFCI. We've got Carmen with us today.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.880]   Carmen, I just wanted to ask,
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:06.880]   what do you think is the most important thing to bridge the gap between the different generations?
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.880]   So understanding is the most important thing, which I think,
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.880]   because I love to have my thoughts to be understood by my parents
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.880]   and also maybe people who are older than me.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.880]   I think, yeah, understanding is a very important one.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.880]   Yeah, I think that's a great one, Carmen. Let's see what other people have to say.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.880]   The most important part about crossing generations is acceptance.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.880]   Because while you might not agree with the other person's views,
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.880]   you can accept them and love them despite of it.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.880]   We have to care about the older generations and learn from them
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.880]   so that we can set an example for the youngest generation.
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.880]   To show Christ's love to our next generations.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:52.880]   So we have to give them this kind of trust and respect and understanding.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   You need to have guts. If you don't have guts, pray to God and he'll give you wisdom.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.880]   We all need the courage and step up to talk to them.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.880]   We need all generations working together
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   because the older generations have a lot of experience more than the younger ones
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.880]   and they're eager to listen and learn from the older generations.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.880]   I firmly believe that united single-minded passion for the glory of God
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.880]   is essential for crossing generations.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.880]   The worship of God, that is God getting the praise and honor that he deserves
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.880]   and us having our deepest wants and needs satisfied in him.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:31.880]   I think that what crossing generations really means is
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   understanding those differences and those different struggles
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   and seeing how each generation tackles them in a different way
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.880]   and learning from that and learning from one another in that way.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.880]   I strongly believe you need to be low.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:51.880]   Now we're going to pray for the generations.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.880]   And firstly I'd like to pray for the younger generation.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.880]   Father God, we thank you, Lord, for the younger generation.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.880]   We thank you, Lord, for the life that we see within them.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.880]   We thank you for their vitality, for their zeal for you.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   I pray, Lord, that we as the older generation would recognize the gifts,
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.880]   the talents of our young generation and that we would empower them.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.880]   Lord, that we would work together for your glory.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:28.880]   And I just bless the younger generation of this church and this city
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.880]   to know their God, to know who they are, to know their identity,
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.880]   that they are sons and daughters of the living God.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:45.880]   And as I pray for Bonnie, Lord, I pray for all of our young people.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.880]   Lord, that each one of them, I call them now into the destiny
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.880]   that you have prepared for them.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.880]   Lord, prepare them for the future.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:03.880]   But Lord, use them in the present, in Jesus' name.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.880]   Amen.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.880]   Lord, just thank you for John, Lord.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.880]   Thank you for so many others like him who are really passionate
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.880]   about reaching out to the younger generation, Lord,
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.880]   who are really ready to just teach and just equip the younger generation
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.880]   to allow them to move into their calling as future leaders, Lord.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.880]   I just pray for the older generation, Lord.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.880]   I thank you for their passion for you.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.880]   I thank you for their experience, for their zeal,
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.880]   for their dedication towards you as your loyal servants, Lord.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   So Lord, I just pray for them.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.880]   I pray that, yeah, Lord, that you would really give them the patience
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   and the wisdom to keep leading this younger generation, Lord,
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   to be able to pass on their years of service to us, Lord.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.880]   And I also pray, Lord, that you would keep them and bless them.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.880]   And just, yeah, Lord, just pour your blessings over them
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.880]   and their children and their children, Lord.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   I just pray all this in your wonderful name, Lord,
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   and I pray this in the name of Lord Jesus.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.880]   Amen.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   It's great that we've been able to pray.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.880]   Our other prayer is that God would use us as a team,
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.880]   the younger generation and the older generation, together.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   And now we're going to pass over to Pastor James for our sermon.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.880]   [Pastor James]
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.880]   It's a joy to be able to bring you the Word today.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.880]   And we are so missing everyone just being able to gather,
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   and we are really, really close now.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   We're praying that in these coming weeks we will have a chance to just be together again.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.880]   Today I'm going to be talking about how we cross generations.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.880]   You know, coming to Hong Kong, one of the biggest inspirations for me
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.880]   has been meeting Pastor John and Pastor Peter,
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   who have this vision to embrace this next generation.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:59.880]   And this last year, the next generation have had a torch shone on them
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   because the next generation are showing some of the feelings
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   or the frustrations they have about their future.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   And we know that the next generation that is coming up in Hong Kong
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   is in deep need of the Gospel, in deep need of hope
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   and being told that everything is going to be okay.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.880]   And so for us as a church, the question really remains is
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.880]   how do we serve this next generation?
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.880]   How do we cross generations in our ministries?
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.880]   And in my work with Young Life now, that is what it's all about.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.880]   How do we introduce the next generation to Jesus Christ?
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.880]   And then for a parachurch, how do we work together with the church,
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.880]   all being a part of the body of Christ in solving this problem?
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.880]   For me, as we talk about how to cross generations,
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.880]   the first thing we need to think about is before we even get to the solution,
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.880]   we first need to understand the problem.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.880]   And the problem is this.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.880]   There is difficulty with doing next generation work
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.880]   because there is such a thing as a generation gap.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.880]   The generation gap is there because generations are simply different.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.880]   And they've always been different since the beginning of mankind.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.880]   But they've been even more amplified now because of technology,
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.880]   because of globalization.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.880]   So what we have now are generations are becoming so divided
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.880]   in their way of thinking and their way of acting.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.880]   For example, we have a generation called the Baby Boomers
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:20.880]   who are on the whole born in between the '40s and the '60s.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:24.880]   A lot of the current society's leaders are part of this generation.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.880]   And this generation, the Baby Boomers, they come from a time
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.880]   where things were not so good in Hong Kong,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.880]   when Hong Kong was still making small steps
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.880]   into becoming this big city that it is right now.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.880]   But these Baby Boomers have something very interesting,
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.880]   is that in this kind of maybe poorer beginning,
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.880]   they have learned to get it done.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:43.880]   They are called the Get It Done Generation.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   They work hard.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.880]   The mantra of this generation is survival and community.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.880]   Things were tough, so it's all about surviving.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   It's all about function.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   It's all about efficiency.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.880]   And it's all about community, sticking together.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   So they would trust leadership.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:58.880]   They would trust authority.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.880]   They would put their trust in establishments.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.880]   So that's the Baby Boomers.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.880]   And then from the Baby Boomers, you move into what they call the Gen X.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.880]   And this is actually only a very small decade.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.880]   It fits snugly in between the Baby Boomers and the Millennials.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.880]   And these guys have started to learn to become a bit more independent.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.880]   They're a bit more ambitious
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.880]   because their parents have maybe paved the way for them.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.880]   And then you reach this big group, which is the Millennials,
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.880]   born in the '70s all the way up to the '90s.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.880]   And this group are very different from the Baby Boomers.
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.880]   If the Baby Boomers were about survival and community,
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.880]   the Millennials are about authenticity and vulnerability.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.880]   They're about finding their own identity, their own calling.
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.880]   It's a lot more about feeling.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.880]   It's a lot more about their own personal ambitions.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.880]   They don't trust establishments as much.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.880]   They don't trust institutions.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:51.880]   Their trust in leadership is not the same as the Baby Boomers.
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.880]   And their language is different.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.880]   If the Baby Boomers were more about honouring and respecting,
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:01.880]   the heart's cry of a Millennial is to be listened to and to be loved.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   And so even between these few generations, you see there are differences.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.880]   And then you go further now into Gen Z,
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.880]   and the next one's called Alpha, which is the last decade.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.880]   And these children are born into a society where technology is at their fingertips.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   They are used to talking more to Alexa than to their friends.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.880]   They are used to using smartphones and smart devices.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.880]   And they are in a completely different generation as well.
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.880]   So the question is this.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:30.880]   How does a church do cross-generational work
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   in a way that is able to kind of serve all the different generations?
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.880]   It is not an easy task, and I'm not going to be able to give you the answer,
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.880]   even within this sermon.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.880]   But as I look through Scripture, as I look through the Word of God,
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.880]   there are some principles that I've found that are so key,
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:50.880]   so key for the body of Christ to be remembering
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.880]   as we head into cross-generational work.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.880]   And I want to share three of them with you today.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.880]   The first one is this.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:58.880]   Whilst we're doing cross-generational work,
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:04.880]   the first thing we have to remember is that the church exists for all generations.
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.880]   There's a quote that I really love, and it says this.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.880]   "There is a human tendency for each generation
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:14.880]   to believe and act as though the church exists for them."
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.880]   There is a human tendency for each generation to buy into the idea
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.880]   that the church was built for them, so everything is about them.
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.880]   The worship is tailored to their musical preferences.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   The sermons are preached in a style that is good for them.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   And when it's not, they get upset.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.880]   The first key to doing cross-generational ministry is to remind everyone
[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:40.880]   that we are all part of this generation.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.880]   The people that are on this planet right now,
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.880]   the people that are in our churches right now,
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.880]   are all part of this generation,
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   and we are all different parts of the body of Christ.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   1 Corinthians 12 talks about this, that there are different parts to the body,
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.880]   and I believe that is the same for the different generations.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.880]   The diversity there is what makes it beautiful.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:07.880]   Maybe someone in a generation who really values honour and respect and authority
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   has so much good to bring to a church community,
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:19.880]   just as much as someone who maybe values more ambition and individuality and creativity.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   We all bring different parts to the body of Christ.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   We need to remember that all generations are part of this.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.880]   You see, the problem is if you just focus on one generation,
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.880]   there's two real dangers that happen.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:37.880]   One is the generation that you're targeting ends up thinking that this is all about them.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.880]   And the other is the generations that you're not targeting feel neglected, feel left out.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.880]   But if the church, imagine a church where people of all ages
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.880]   embrace the mission to serve each other, regardless of age,
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:57.880]   bringing what they have, their experiences, their upbringing, their personalities,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:03.880]   bringing it into the body of Christ and allowing God to create this masterpiece, this mosaic,
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.880]   that includes all the different generations, that is the first key.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.880]   We are all in this together.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.880]   There is no next generation and previous generation.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.880]   We are all this generation. That's number one.
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.880]   Number two is this.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:25.880]   In that diversity, unity is only achieved through humility.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   Humility is the key.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.880]   Now, what does that look like?
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   Because when we have so many people from so many different ages,
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.880]   the diversity is incredible.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.880]   The only way we can get everyone together and to stay together is if everyone remains humble,
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.880]   if everyone is open to the other's differences, to the other's preferences.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.880]   Philippians 2 talks about this.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.880]   Paul says, "If you have any encouragement in Christ,
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:57.880]   if there's any participation in the Spirit, be of the same mind, the same love, be of one accord.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.880]   Consider others more significant than yourselves. Put their interests first."
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.880]   What does this look like?
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.880]   It looks like someone from one generation going to another saying,
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:09.880]   "Hey, this isn't really my musical style, but I know it's your jam,
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.880]   and I'm willing to go with it, and I'm willing to follow it because I love you.
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   Because I love you, I want to put your interests above mine."
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:22.880]   And then it's the other person saying, "Look, I don't like this kind of style of preaching,
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.880]   but I know that it speaks to you.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.880]   I'm willing to accommodate this and have this within our church
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.880]   because I want to build up the body of Christ as one."
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.880]   It's humility.
[00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.880]   You see, if we want true unity, there has to be diversity.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.880]   Pastor John has said time and time again,
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.880]   if we are just all the same people just gathering together,
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.880]   that's not really unity, that's uniformity.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.880]   That's what he said.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.880]   If we want true unity, it's different people coming from different generations
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:55.880]   with different preferences all getting together.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.880]   And the only way it works is humility.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.880]   It's someone looking across the aisle and saying,
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   "You are worth it. I love you just as I love myself,
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.880]   and I'm willing to put you above me."
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.880]   That is the key here, and that ties in with the first one.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.880]   It requires all generations to be humble.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:19.880]   It requires the people who are yearning and desiring to be listened to and loved.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:22.880]   So also recognize that there are people here who actually,
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.880]   their way of expressing love is through honor and respect and provision,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.880]   and it just looks different.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.880]   It's being aware of the problem so we can find the solution together.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:40.880]   We obtain unity despite diversity through humility.
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.880]   The final one is this, and this is where I want to dive a little bit
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.880]   into the scripture as we talk about this.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.880]   If we are to really want to do cross-generational work,
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   the key thing here in this final point is this.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:56.880]   We must invest and empower young leaders.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.880]   We must.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.880]   You see, there's this tendency in our culture here,
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.880]   which is a very autocratic, hierarchical culture
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.880]   where you have to earn the right to be heard
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.880]   and you have to essentially do your time before you become a leader.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.880]   But the problem is if we want to do cross-generational work,
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   we need to pick out some of the young leaders,
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   the young promising leaders now, and invest in them and empower them
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.880]   and also to take a risk on them.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.880]   We've all been there where we're trying to teach someone younger than us something
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   and they're just not doing it as well as we can,
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.880]   so we end up doing it for them and we don't let them do it.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.880]   But then they don't learn, and by the time they do learn, it's too late.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.880]   They're disillusioned, they're frustrated, their gift has gone to waste.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:42.880]   If we are to do effective cross-generational work,
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.880]   we have to identify, invest, and empower these young leaders now.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   And a great example of this is in scripture.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.880]   It's in the man Timothy.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.880]   See, Timothy, we all hear about, because maybe the most famous passage
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.880]   is the one that Paul writes to Timothy as a mentor writing to a mentee
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.880]   and saying, you know, 1 Timothy 4.12,
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.880]   "Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young."
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.880]   Set an example.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.880]   And so we know that Timothy was a church leader who was relatively young,
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   maybe in his 30s when he was leading a church,
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   when Paul was writing to him about this.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.880]   But if you rewind even further, if you rewind the story
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:24.880]   all the way back to the time where Paul first meets Timothy,
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.880]   I find some really interesting things that happen.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.880]   In Acts 16, Paul goes on his missionary journey.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.880]   He goes to Derbe and he goes to Lystra.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.880]   And when he reaches there, he meets this young man called Timothy,
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.880]   who was likely just a teenager at the time.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.880]   Timothy was extremely interesting.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.880]   He was the first second-generation Christian.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.880]   He was also bicultural.
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.880]   His mother, Eunice, was a Jew.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.880]   His father was a Greek.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:57.880]   And what happens in those first few verses in Acts 16 is we see Paul
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:02.880]   meeting this young man, this young teenager, this boy, Timothy.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.880]   And Timothy had a good reputation.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:08.880]   That's what it says in the Scripture there, that he was of good repute.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.880]   He was a "guide."
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   He was going to the church and he was probably top of his Sunday school class,
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.880]   doing well, but he was still a young man nonetheless.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:21.880]   And then you have this apostle Paul coming in from a different place,
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:26.880]   reaching this little town, and from there he identifies this young man, Timothy.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   And then what does he do?
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.880]   He invests in him and he empowers him.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:36.880]   He looks at this young man and says, "You come with me to minister together.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.880]   You may be young in age, but I see something in you,
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.880]   and I want to take you with me.
[00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.880]   I want to take you under my wing and do this."
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.880]   That is what we need to do.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.880]   We need to look at some of the young people and we need to say,
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.880]   "How can I invest in you?
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:56.880]   How can I pave the way for you so that you can become an effective minister
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:01.880]   and a devoted believer and follower of Christ in your own right?
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:04.880]   How can I let you start making decisions?
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.880]   How can I let you make mistakes yourself so you can learn from them?"
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   It's willing to give up this fear of making mistakes,
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   fear of looking bad, and fear of shame, but this is saying,
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.880]   "Hey, the next generation, the young people are important,
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.880]   and they'll be wanting to serve across the board.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.880]   We need leaders across the board."
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.880]   And you see, with Timothy, it's interesting.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.880]   It wasn't only the Apostle Paul and outside coming in to invest in him.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.880]   It was also his mother and grandmother in 2 Timothy 1 and 5.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.880]   We see that.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.880]   Paul's writing to Timothy much later on now, and he's saying,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.880]   "I saw a sincere faith in you, Timothy,
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:48.880]   that I first saw in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice."
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:51.880]   So what we see here is that not only are church brothers and sisters,
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:57.880]   church leaders such as Paul, willing to invest in someone young like Timothy,
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.880]   but also it starts within the home that Timothy himself was invested to
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:05.880]   by his grandmother and his mother.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:11.880]   "It takes a village to raise a child" is the quote that we often hear.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   "It takes a whole church community to raise a leader."
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:21.880]   We need to be committed to investing and empowering the young people
[00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.880]   because they are the ones that are going to be the future of this city as well.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:31.880]   But they won't survive, and they won't do well if those of us who are more experienced,
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:35.880]   more mature, more wise, more weathered,
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.880]   they won't do well unless this group of people chooses to invest
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:44.880]   and pour into these people and to give them opportunities and to give them chances.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.880]   That is how we start doing cross-generational work.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:54.880]   And I truly believe that we are entering into a new norm in this city.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.880]   What we knew before may be changed when we come out of this pandemic,
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:02.880]   and there are going to be new ways, and God we know is moving in this city
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.880]   in new and mysterious and beautiful ways.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:12.880]   My prayer, our prayer as a staff here, is that our church, the body of Christ,
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:20.880]   will be mobilised and will be committed to serving the people of all generations
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.880]   and being willing to follow God's guidance and his spirit in doing this.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   So my prayer to you, brother and sister, is as you receive this word,
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   start thinking and start praying to God.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.880]   Who are the people that God has placed in your life, whether younger or older?
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   Who are the people that he has placed in your life who you can start reaching out to,
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.880]   who you can start investing into?
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   And remember, some of these people will make you feel uncomfortable.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:56.880]   Why? Because they're different. They're younger, they're older,
[00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   they have different backgrounds, they're from a different class maybe.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.880]   But the goal here is if we're to do cross-generational ministry,
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.880]   we have to be willing to be comfortably uncomfortable,
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:14.880]   because that is what Christ did for us, that he would leave heaven's throne,
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:21.880]   remove the comfort from himself, come into a world, become completely uncomfortable,
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:26.880]   and then to subject himself to death on a cross, to lay his life down for us,
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:32.880]   and to die, but then to rise again so that we can identify with his death and his resurrection.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.880]   And if we truly believe that, and if we truly do that,
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:43.880]   we will then be on to a great start in how we lay our lives down for those in our church, regardless of age.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.880]   Bless you.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.880]   James, that was an incredible message.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.880]   After a message like that and a subject like Linking the Generations,
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.880]   there's only one song we could go out with.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.880]   This was a song that was written just about eight weeks ago,
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:07.880]   but a song which has gone out all around the world and has been blessing generations in every nation.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:13.880]   I want you to join in tonight to sing this for you to be blessed,
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:22.880]   and for your children and your children and your children's children to be blessed as we worship together.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:33.880]   [Music]
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:41.880]   The Lord bless you and keep you,
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:48.880]   Make his face shine upon us, be gracious to you.
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:40:06.880]   Lord, turn his face toward you and give you peace.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:14.880]   The Lord bless you and keep you,
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:21.880]   Make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:39.880]   The Lord turn his face toward you and give you peace.
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:41:08.880]   Amen, Amen, Amen.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:16.880]   The Lord bless you and keep you,
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:23.880]   Make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   Lord, turn his face toward you and give you peace.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   Amen, Amen, Amen.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:22.880]   Amen, Amen, Amen.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:37.880]   Amen, Amen, Amen.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.880]   [Music]
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:51.880]   Amen, Amen, Amen.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:58.880]   May his favor be upon you in a thousand generations,
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:06.880]   in your family, in your children, in their children, in their children.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:13.880]   May his favor be upon you in a thousand generations,
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:20.880]   in your family, in your children, in their children, in their children.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:27.880]   May his favor be upon you in a thousand generations,
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:35.880]   in your family, in your children, in their children, in their children.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:42.880]   May his presence go before you and behind you and beside you,
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.880]   all around you and within you.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:52.880]   He is with you, he is with you in the morning, in the evening,
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:59.880]   in your coming, in your going, in your weeping and rejoicing.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:17.760]   His for you, His for you, His for you, His for you, His for you!
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:45.120]   Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen!
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:45:14.160]   Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen!
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:25.720]   What an amazing service about crossing generations.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.640]   Let us pray to the Lord now that He would bind us together.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.240]   Heavenly Father, we thank you that you are the head of our church.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.600]   And we thank you that Lord you have blessed us as the body.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:42.120]   That Lord you would connect us together from generation to generation.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.840]   Help us Lord that you would bind us through the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:49.120]   That we would cross any barriers that are in our way.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:52.880]   So Lord we can expand your kingdom on earth.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:57.280]   Lord bless us as we go that we can empower younger leaders.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.760]   That Lord we can encourage one another and learn from one another.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.640]   In Christ's name we pray, Amen.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   Amen.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   Amen.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.640]   Amen.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:19.640]   Amen.
