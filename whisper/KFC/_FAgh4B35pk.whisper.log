[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Good evening church, how are you?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Great, wow, not a lively crowd tonight.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   We're talking about women in the Bible
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   and we've been going through this amazing series so far.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Pastor John kicked us off with who?
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Eve, that's right, that's right.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And then last week, Julian did an amazing job
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   and told us about the story of Sarah.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   And today we're gonna go through the story of Rebecca
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   and who knows a Rebecca in their life?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Who knows a Rebecca in their life?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   It's a very common name and we're gonna learn
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   about the story of Rebecca in the Old Testament.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   It's spelled a little differently, right?
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   It's spelled with a K, not with a C.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Modern day, most people are spelled with a C.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   So we're gonna talk about the story of Rebecca
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   and it starts off with the story of Abraham.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Now Abraham knew he was getting old, right?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   And he wanted his son to get married.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And so he went to his servant, it says in verse two,
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   "I swear by the Lord that you will not take a wife
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   "for my son from the daughter of the Canaanites
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   "among whom I dwell, but go to my country,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   "to my kindred and take a wife for my son there."
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And so this servant made that commitment.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   He made this bold commitment to serve Abraham.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And so he took 10 of his master's camels
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   and departed with a lot of gifts, okay?
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Imagine 10 camels, who's been to the desert before?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Rode on camels, very good.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   It wasn't the most comfortable ride.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It wasn't like being in a limousine.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   But 10 camels, lots of gifts, and this is where he went.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   So he went from Hebron, we'll see in the next slide here,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Hebron, and then he went up to Haran.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And then where was Abraham from?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   He was from Ur.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And these people, what did they worship?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   They sort of worshiped the stars.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   They were astronomers, astrologers, right?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And so he went to Ur.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And he went to Ur with this sort of prayer to God.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   God, now the person, the woman that I meet,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   may this woman give me a drink
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   because it's been a really long journey,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   1,450 kilometers, right?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   If you go around the desert.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And I pray that after she gives me a drink,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   she will also say that she would give a drink
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   to my camels as well.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   And so we read on in verse 13.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It says, "Behold, I am standing at the spring of water,
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   "and the daughters of the men of the city
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   "are coming to draw water.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   "Let this woman be what I prayed for."
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And so we see a picture, sort of a painting
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   from some Italian painter.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   And this is sort of the servant in the middle here.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And then you see Rebecca by the well there.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And so as soon as the servant prayed this prayer,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   there was Rebecca, verse 15.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Before he had finished praying,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   "Behold, Rebecca, who was born of Bethuel,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   "the son of Michal, and the wife of Nahor,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   "Abraham's brother, came out with her jar of water
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   "on her shoulder."
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   This young woman was very attractive in appearance.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   "A maiden whom no man has known,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   "she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   "Then the servant ran to meet her and said,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   "'Please give me a water to drink from your jar.'
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   "And she said, 'Drink, my lord.'
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   "And she quickly let down her jar upon her hand
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   "and gave him a drink.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   "When she had finished giving him a drink,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   "she said, 'I will draw water for your camels also,'
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   "until they have finished drinking.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   "So she quickly emptied her jar
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   "and went to fill it with water to help the camels drink."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So anyways, that's the story.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Do you know how many liters camels actually drink?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Do you know how many liters camels actually drink?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   20 gallons of water, okay?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   That's 75 liters, 75 liters.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So imagine 10 camels, all right?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   75 liters each.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And maybe your jar is,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   well, it can't be more than one of those liter,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I don't know, five liters things outside, right?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Like, that's crazy.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   The amount of hard work it would take,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   it would take maybe an hour or more to fill,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   you know, fulfill the needs of these camels.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And so we see the good of Rebecca from this verse,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   from these verses.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Firstly, the good is she was attractive.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Not many women in the Bible were commented as attractive.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Only several, actually.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   We preached on one last week.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Sarah was stated as attractive and beautiful.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Esther, right?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Lot's daughters were also known as beautiful.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   There was also a queen that was named as very beautiful.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And so Rebecca was special.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   She's one of few that were named,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   was a beautiful, attractive lady.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   And it also says that she was a maiden.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So she was pure, unmarried, young woman.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   And that she was also, we can see that she's servant-hearted.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   The servant asked for a drink and she was willing.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And not only was she willing, she was also intuitive.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   She's like, oh, you have so many camels.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Let me also help them to have a drink.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And so as soon as the servant saw this woman
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and how she had answered her prayer from the Lord,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   he did what?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   We're gonna see in verse 22.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   He showered her with gifts, right?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   A gold ring, right?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Bracelets.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Please tell me whose daughter you are.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And she tells him whose daughter she is.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And the servant even asks, right?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Is there a place for me to stay at your father's house?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And she even invites him.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And she says, yes, there are many rooms in my father's house.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   There's many, right?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   You can come and spend the night.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And we can also see what happens later.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Laban or Laban, his brother, and also his father said,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   in response to meeting the servant
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   and the servant explaining his whole story,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   this thing that has come from the Lord,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   we cannot speak to you bad or good.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Behold, Rebecca is before you.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Take her and go.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Let her be the wife of your master's son
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   as the Lord has spoken.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   So it's been an incredible journey.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   The servant has traveled 1,450 kilometers by camel.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Now the camel goes like this, right?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   It was not a comfortable ride.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   He arrives and he prays this prayer
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   and God answers his prayer almost immediately.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   He asks to be going to his house, her house to stay.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   And she invites him.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And their parents and the brother was like, yes,
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   what you have said is from the Lord.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Take her.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   This is an amazing romantic story
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   that has been orchestrated by the Lord.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Amazing.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And the brother and mother has this one request.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Let the young woman remain with us a while, 10 days,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   and then she may go.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   But the servant was like, no, do not delay me.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Since the Lord has prospered my way,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   send me away that I may go to my master.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   They said, let us call the young woman and ask her.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Then they called Rebecca and said to her,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   will you go with this man?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   And she said, I will go.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It's incredible, right?
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   He meets her.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   He stays over and then asks,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   can I, this is what has happened.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I prayed this prayer.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   God has answered it.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I made this oath to my master.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And now you are, I believe you are the one
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   that God has proposed to marry my master,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   my master's son.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And the family agrees.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   What do they worship?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   They worship the stars.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   They worship the astrologers and astronomers.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   They were astrologers and astronomers, right?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Like, and yet they believed what this servant said.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   And they were willing to give their only daughter.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Who would give their daughter away
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   after meeting this servant for one night?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And they were like, oh, let this daughter stay with us.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   You know, Gordon, would you let one of your daughters?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Which one, I'm joking.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   (laughing)
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   It's amazing.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   The faith of the family.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And then Rebecca as well.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   So we see the good.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   There was no bad things.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   We saw the good, there was no bad.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   And we saw the godly.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Rebecca believed this servant.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Rebecca stood in faith.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   She's never been to Israel or Hebron before.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   She's probably never been really outside of her area.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   The amount of faith it would take to just go.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   There's no, you know, what do you call it?
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   When you look for people to date?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I don't know.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   (laughing)
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Those apps, Pastor John, I'm joking.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   (laughing)
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Those apps, right?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   You could see all their profile.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Isaac is this, Isaac is this.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Oh, he looks good in this pose, this pose.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   There was none of that.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   She went by faith.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   And she was willing to follow.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And I think as much as we see that she had faith,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   it was as much as God working in and through her life.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   In and through her life.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And so she goes back with him.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Immediately, 1,450 kilometers.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   That's quite a drive for us.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Nevermind going on camels.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   And Isaac was meditating.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And when he lifted his eyes up and saw her coming,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Rebecca also lifted up her eyes.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   They had this special glow, you know?
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   And Rebecca was to the servant,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   "Who is this man walking in the field, meeting us?"
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And the servant said, "It is my master."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   So she took a veil and covered herself,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   just as the traditions of that time,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and of marriage.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And the servant told Isaac all the things that had happened.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah, his mother,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   and took Rebecca, and she became his wife.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And he loved her.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   So Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   This is an amazing romantic story
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   that had been orchestrated by God himself.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Isaac, alone here,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Abraham saying, "Go, find a wife for him
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   "from my father's family, not these Canaanites here
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   "that I live around."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And she follows in faith.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And he sees her, marries her, and loves her.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   It's an amazing story.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It's an amazing story of God working
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   in the life of Rebecca and Isaac, both sides.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And we also see that this sort of foreshadows the gospel.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   You have Abraham, the father.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   You have Isaac, the son, the only son.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   The servant, it doesn't name here who exactly the servant is,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   but from Genesis 15 earlier,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   we know that the head servant of Abraham was Elanizer,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   and his name means God, my help.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And then we see Rebecca as the bride.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Isn't that sort of like the gospel?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   God sends his only son, right?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And he sends his Holy Spirit to help,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   the helper, the comforter,
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and the bride, the bride of Christ, which is the church.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   It foreshadows the beauty of the gospel.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   And we see similarities between Isaac and Jesus, right?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Isaac was promised, right?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   How old was Abraham?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   He was around 100 years old.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Sarah was 90.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   But God said, "You will have a child."
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Isaac was promised.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Jesus was promised.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   He was prophesied, over 300 prophecies about him.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   Jesus appeared at the appointed time.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Isaac came after a long time of waiting
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   from Abraham and Sarah.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   They were both miracle childs, right?
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Jesus was born of a virgin.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Abraham and Sarah had Isaac at a very old age.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   It was a miracle.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   They were both have special names from the Lord.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Both were offered as a sacrifice, right?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Abraham went up to the mountain
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   and was about to offer his son
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   because the Lord had commanded.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   And that foreshadows what Jesus did.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Thousands of years later,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Jesus dying on the cross.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   And Jesus prepares a place for us in heaven.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   And Isaac prepared a place for his bride here.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   There's also similarities between Rebecca and the church, right?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Rebecca was chosen by God.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   The church, we are the chosen, right?
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   We're chosen to do his ministry.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Be the hands and feet of God.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   We are part, the church is a part of God's eternal purpose.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   He has a plan for us
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   to use us for his eternal purposes
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   to accomplish the work of the gospel.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Rebecca was part of the plan.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   The plan to accomplish the promises of God.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Both were destined to share in glory with the son.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Rebecca learned of Isaac through his servant, Elanizar.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   The church learns of Jesus through the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Rebecca had to surrender everything
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   so that she could serve and be married in joy
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   to fulfill the promises of God.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   And the church, we also have to surrender our past,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   deny ourself, take up the cross and follow him.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Both Rebecca and the church are loved and cared for.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   What an amazing story
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   that foreshadows the beauty of the gospel.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   An amazing story.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   We're gonna continue with the second part of the story.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Now, things always get interesting
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   when kids are involved, right?
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   John and Sandra was life so much more interesting
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   when kids, yeah?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And so we see here in the next part,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   verse 19, Abraham fathered Isaac
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And Isaac prayed to the Lord for his wife
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   because she was barren and the Lord granted his prayer.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And Rebecca, his wife conceived.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Verse 22, the children struggled together within her
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   and she said, "If it is thus, why is this happening to me?"
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   So she went to inquire of the Lord
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   and the Lord said to her, "Two nations are in your womb.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   "And two peoples within you shall be divided.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   "The one shall be stronger than the other
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   "and the older shall serve the younger."
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   And so here are the good things we see about Rebecca in this.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Well, it says Isaac prayed for his wife
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   'cause they couldn't conceive, right?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   And we'll learn it was quite a length of time
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   that Rebecca could not conceive.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And so Isaac prayed for his wife.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   We see this pattern of prayer, meditation.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   When Isaac was waiting for his wife, Rebecca, to come,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   he was also meditating and now he prays for his wife.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   That's a great thing.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And God provided twins.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   The first twins in the Bible, who's a twin here?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   We know of one, one very special lady, Agnes.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   (laughs)
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Agnes has a twin, right?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   And so twins, the first twins in the Bible, it's amazing.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   It's also good that Rebecca inquired of the Lord.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   There was a struggle within her.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And God answered her prayer with a prophecy.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   It's amazing, this prophecy.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   How would you feel if you received this prophecy
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   that there's two nations in your womb, right?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   How would you feel that these two people will be divided?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Oh, two nations, oh, that's pretty cool.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   But it's gonna be divided?
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   These two kids?
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   One shall serve the other?
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   The older shall serve the younger?
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   How does that work?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   How would you feel if you were Rebecca?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   It would be a pretty confusing prophecy, right?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   You'd be like, what's going on, God?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   What's going on?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   And so we see what happens at birth.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   There are twins in the womb.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   The first came out red, all his body like a hairy coat.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   And they named him Esau because of that.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   And then the brother came out holding what?
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Holding Esau's heel.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   And so they named him Jacob.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And Isaac was 60 years old when she bore them.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   How old was Isaac when he got married?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   40.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   They waited 20 years for kids.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   20 years.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   And so we see the good.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   But we also see the bad.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   man of the field, and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And so because of that, Isaac loved Esau
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   because he ate of his game.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   But Rebecca loved Jacob.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And so the bad thing was favoritism.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   And whenever there's favoritism in the family,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   it complicates things.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   There's jealousy is involved.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   And jealousy can lead to anger and hatred and betrayal
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   and all these sort of things.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   And so we see, I'm just gonna summarize
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   one of the classic stories, right?
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   Jacob and Esau.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Who's the older?
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Esau.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And so Esau, according to the customs back then,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   he had the birthright, all right?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   And so he was very hungry one time, all right?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Imagine you went for a 10K run or a marathon, right?
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And you come back and you're just famished.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   You're like, "Oh, I'm starving."
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And Jacob has this delicious stew just right there.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   And Esau's like, "Give me some of that stew, man,
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   "or I'm gonna die."
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And Jacob, you know, his name is clutching the heel
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   or sort of a trickster.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   So he wants something in return.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And what he wants is the birthright.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   And the birthright represented several things.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   The first is a double portion of the inheritance.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Okay, a double portion.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   So it means you get two thirds, all right?
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   And your brother gets one third.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   That's quite significant, right?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Especially 'cause Abraham had a lot, right?
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And then it also represented
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   that you would become the spiritual leader
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   after the father died.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   So those were the two things that we saw.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Later, Abraham and, sorry, Isaac and Sarah,
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   they live in this region, right?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   And they meet Abimelech.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Sorry, how do you say his name?
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   - Abimelech. - Abimelech, right?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Abimelech, who was a king of the Philistines.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And Abimelech says, "Oh, you can live here."
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Right?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   "But who is this lady?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   "Who's this nice lady beside you?
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   "Very attractive."
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And just like Abraham, right?
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Abraham makes the same mistake as,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   or Isaac makes the same mistake as Abraham.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And he says, "Well, this is my sister."
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   And later, the king finds out.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And he's like, "Why are you lying?"
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   You know, something could have happened to her.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   "Why are you lying?"
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   So imagine Rebecca having to pretend
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   to be the sister of Isaac for several years.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   So maybe she's a good actor as well, right?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   She's a good actor.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And finally, we're gonna look at the story.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   The final story is this.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   As Abraham, or as Isaac approaches near his death.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   So Isaac was old and his eyes were dim.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   He couldn't really see.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   And so he felt like it was time.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   It was time.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   And he called Esau, "My son, you know,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   "behold, I'm gonna bless you.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   "First, what you're gonna do,
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   "you're gonna go out, take some game,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   "you know, get some game,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   "and then prepare it for me.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   "And then I will be able to bless you before I die."
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   All right, this is like the final deathbed
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   that actually, you know, Isaac lives for,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   you know, I think 20 more years or something like that.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   But he felt like it was time
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   to pass on this blessing, this birthright.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And so what happens is Rebecca overhears.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Let's read together, verse five, one, two, three.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   "Now Rebecca was listening
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   "when Isaac spoke of his son Esau.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   "So when Esau went to the field
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   "to hunt for game and bring it,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   "Rebecca said to her son Jacob,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   "'I heard your father speak to Esau.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   "'Go to the flock and bring me two good young goats
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   "'so that I may prepare from them
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   "'delicious food for your father,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   "'such as he loves,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   "'and you shall bring it to your father to eat
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   "'so that he may bless you before he dies.'"
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Let's continue reading, verse 11.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   "So Jacob said to Rebecca, his mother,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   "'Behold, my brother Esau is a very hairy man
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   "'and I am a smooth one.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   "'Perhaps my father will feel me,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   "'and mocking me,
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   "'and bring curses upon myself and not a blessing.'
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   "His mother said to him,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   "'Let your curse be on me, my son.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   "'Only obey my voice and go, bring them to me.'
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   "So we saw the good.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   "We saw the bad, favoritism.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   "And now we see the ugly."
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   So Rebecca receives this prophecy
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   that the old will serve the younger,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   the nation will be divided,
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   the stronger will serve the weaker.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   And yet she is trying to have manipulative scheming
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   to get her own way, right?
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   She overhears, she overhears.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Mothers hear everything in the home, right?
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   They hear everything.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   They have really good intuition.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   And so what she does,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   she convinces Jacob to deceive Isaac.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And Isaac is hesitant, right?
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Like, I don't wanna deceive my father.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   My father is very hairy, I'm smooth.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   Like, there's gonna be curses upon me, right?
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   So what does Rebecca do?
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   She goes so far as to say,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   let the curses fall upon her.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   She's willing to be the sacrifice
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   for what would happen.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   And so obviously Jacob goes along with this, right?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   Oh, okay, that's fine.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   You'll take all the curses.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   There's nothing for me really to lose.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   The problem with this
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   is that the whole family did not trust each other.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   Did Isaac know of the prophecy?
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   It doesn't really say.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   We don't know.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   But he might've overheard the prophecy, right?
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   So some commentaries say this,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   that he knew of the prophecy
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   and also tried to get his own way
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   because he loved Esau.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And Esau did not trust the family.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   He actually, he sold his birthright to Jacob.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   But yet what's happening here?
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   He's trying to get the blessing from Isaac.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   So he, well, he's deceiving Jacob as well
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   because he supposedly sold his birthright.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Jacob should be the one receiving the blessing.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And then obviously Jacob deceives his father
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   and then steals the blessing from his brother.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And the mother is the master schemer of all of it.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   What a wonderful family.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   They lie, they deceive, they manipulate,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   they scheme against each other.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   It's ugly.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   It's very ugly.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   And then in the end,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   later Esau plans to kill Jacob
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   because he learns that Jacob has stolen the blessing.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   And so Rebecca sends Jacob away
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   to hide at his brother's house in Haran.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   And so in a sense,
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   one, he's lost sort of both children.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   One he's had to sent away because of hiding
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   and the other,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Esau might be angry with her
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   because she's the one that's sort of behind all this.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   And so what are the lessons that we need to learn here
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   from today's message of Rebecca?
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   The first lesson is this,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   that God keeps his promises.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Abraham's promise,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   God's promise to Abraham was this,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   And Isaac was not married.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And so God fulfilled it
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   through the promise of Rebecca.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And so we also see, the second lesson is this,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   that God works when we don't see it.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   God was working in the life of Rebecca.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   God was working in the life of Isaac
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   and they both met miraculously.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   The next thing we need to learn is
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   that we need to wait and trust in God's promises.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Rebecca knew that the nations would be divided within her,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   but she didn't wait.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   She didn't trust in the Lord.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   She thought she could do it herself.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   And so she used scheming and deceit
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   to accomplish what she thought she wanted
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   'cause she favored Jacob.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And lastly, we need to learn
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   that the blessings come from God.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Each family member tried to get the blessing
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   or give the blessing through their own strength,
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   through their own power.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Isaac tried to steal back the blessing
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   using his own strength.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Jacob tried to deceive to get the blessing.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   But in the end, we must know
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   that the blessing comes from the Lord.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And so today, do we trust in God's promises?
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Are you trusting in God's promises today?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   The promise of eternal life,
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   the promise of the Holy Spirit helping us,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   the promise that one day He will return,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   that He has a plan for each one of us
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   'cause we are the children of God.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Do you trust in His promises and His plan?
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   And do you trust in God's timing?
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   God has the best timing.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   God has the best timing for Isaac and Rebecca to get married.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   God had the best timing for them to have children.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   God has His best timing.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   And lastly, do we believe that the blessings come from God?
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Many times we try to get the blessings
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   or gain blessings for ourselves through our own strength.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   But we must recognize that ultimately,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   all good things come from the Lord.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Must wait upon His blessings.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   As you know, we've been teaching these students English
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   in our English Mentorship Program at Chan Baksa,
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   this school in the South side, South Island side.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   And it's been a year of personal messaging,
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   telling them, inviting them to come.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   It's been having lunches with them, treating them.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   It's been playing basketball with them, teaching them English.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   And finally, we had sort of an evangelistic meeting yesterday
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   and 191 people showed up yesterday.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And some of them brought their parents.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   And we've been teaching them Bible stories
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   in our English Mentorship Program.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   We first taught them about the parable of the talents.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   And then we talked about Jonah.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And now we've been talking about David.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   And then yesterday,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   it was the first time we really introduced the gospel to them.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And when the speaker invited people
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   to ask Jesus into their life,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   some of them were like, "Ah, maybe I'll do it.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   "Maybe I'll do it."
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   And then eventually, we can see
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   around 40 of these students rose their hand
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   and asked Jesus, prayed the prayer,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   (congregation applauding)
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   and asked Jesus into their life.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   It's an amazing story.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   It didn't all happen in one night.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   It was hard work.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   It was trusting in the Lord that He is working.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   Sometimes it was frustrating.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Sometimes it was tiring.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   But we trusted in the Lord.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   We trusted that the blessing comes from the Lord.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And so,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   do we trust that the blessing comes from the Lord today?
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Let's just take a time to bow down our heads.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Heavenly Father,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   forgive us
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   for trusting in our own works.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Forgive us for trusting that we could make things right,
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   that our plan is best.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Help us, Lord, to surrender to You,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   to acknowledge that You have what is best for us,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   to trust in Your timing,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   and to believe that the blessings come ultimately from You.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   In Jesus Christ's name, we pray.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
