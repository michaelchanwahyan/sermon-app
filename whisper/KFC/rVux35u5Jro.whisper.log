[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Wow, that was such a heavy video clip to watch.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.540]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.320]   My name is Michelle and I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.960]   It's great to be here to celebrate and to remember what Jesus has done for us.
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.160]   But I come also with a heavy heart because we've just watched a video of Jesus who is
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.280]   suffering on the cross and who died for us.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.520]   And so today we come together really to remember what he has done for us.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:49.880]   And today we'll be looking at the Gospel of Mark, the end of it, from chapters 14 to 16.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.000]   So if you would like to follow along, you may open up your Bibles to those chapters.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.560]   And we're just coming together to see what it is that the author of the Gospel of Mark
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.760]   wants to tell us, because we have four different Gospels and each one will tell it slightly
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.920]   different because there is a message that the author wants to tell us.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.720]   And so today we'll be seeing that there are a lot of people who will be trembling in these
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:29.080]   stories and they're trembling because they don't really understand and know that Jesus
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.280]   is the Son of God.
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.620]   But if we today, if we do know, we don't need to tremble.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.000]   So now let us begin with a prayer.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.560]   Dear heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your word, the Bible that you have left
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:58.280]   to us, so we know about you and we know how much you love us.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.840]   And we thank you that we have the opportunity to read your words and we thank you that you
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.140]   have given your spirit so that we may understand it.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.920]   And today we all come before you praying that your spirit would be amongst us and you speak
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.680]   to us today.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.920]   Thank you so much.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.120]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.200]   Now so just before this scene that we've seen, Jesus was at the Garden of Gethsemane and
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.080]   he was praying because he's about to go onto the cross to do the mission that he came to
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:45.480]   do because as Son of God, he came to flesh and he's gonna take away the sins of the world.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.400]   And so what we find is that one of his disciples, Judas, who betrayed him, is now coming with
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.680]   the servants of the high priests, the elders, and the religious leaders.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.440]   And they're not coming with nothing.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.400]   They came with swords and clubs ready to arrest Jesus.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.120]   And this is what he said.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.400]   Let's look at it together on the slide.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:20.240]   Every day I was with you teaching in the temple courts and you did not arrest me, but the
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.400]   scriptures must be fulfilled.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.360]   Then everyone deserted him and fled.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.160]   A young man wearing nothing but a linen garment was following Jesus.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.920]   When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garments behind.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.920]   Now after this, we know that Jesus was brought to trial in front of the high priests and
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.120]   the Sanhedrin, which is a group of people who would judge on behalf of the Jews.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.680]   And they could not find anything that's faulty of him.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:03.240]   And the only thing that they seem to find is that he is the son, he is the king of Jews.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.840]   But little did they know that's exactly who he is.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.800]   And so what we find is that people are shouting afterwards and they want to crucify him.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.720]   They want to kill him because they were out of jealousy.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.680]   They want to get rid of Jesus.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:33.520]   And so we see that during this arrest and the trial of Jesus and his disciples, they
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.400]   were trembling.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.520]   They were fleeing for their lives at this moment because the Jesus that they knew and
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.200]   thought would be the Messiah is now arrested.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.520]   And he's no longer that powerful God or Jesus that they knew from before.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.920]   And so they were scared and they started to flee.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.320]   And then Jesus began to be taken up.
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.440]   And he was just like a lamb who was about to go and be slaughtered.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.240]   Now what was it in their mind at that time?
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.160]   They thought before the scene that Jesus would be the king and he would save them.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:25.720]   And remember just a few chapters ago, he was riding on a donkey, humbly entering into Jerusalem.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.640]   And just last week, we had our Palm Saturday where Pastor Johnny shared with us about how
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.520]   they were all cheering as he came into Jerusalem.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.680]   And he said, "Hosanna, blessed is the one who came in the name of the Lord."
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.960]   And so they were prepared that he would be king.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.360]   And also the other Jews thought as well as the disciples did that Jesus would be king.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.480]   But how would he be king?
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:02.520]   They had their own ideas, which is that he would come mightily possibly beating down
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:11.280]   or resisting the Roman rule and to have their nations set to be independent.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.880]   And that was the kind of Messiah and the king of Jews that they had in mind.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.520]   And also because remember the three years that they had walked with Jesus?
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.600]   What did Jesus do?
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.560]   He walked on water.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.880]   What else did he do?
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:36.760]   He fed the 5,000 and the 4,000 with just a few loaves of bread and a few fish.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.680]   He were able to castle demons.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.200]   He was able to heal the sick.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:48.400]   He was able to talk to the authorities with authorities that they never knew of.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:56.120]   And so all along up to this point, you see, Jesus was more or less the Messiah that they
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.000]   were thinking about.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.800]   One that would deliver them.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.840]   But at this very moment when he was captured, this was no more.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:14.960]   And in their hearts, this was a great discrepancy from what they thought their king of Jews
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   would be.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.440]   And so they fled.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.960]   Did you see the young man in this verse?
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.000]   The young man actually fled naked.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.640]   That was how scared they were.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.240]   Because you know why they're scared?
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.480]   They need to be on their own now.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:40.120]   Before Jesus was in front of them and he would protect them and they were not afraid.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.160]   But now every man for himself.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.240]   They were running away.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.800]   They were scared.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.720]   And what's more?
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.640]   It's that this went against everything that they were hoping for.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.800]   Remember when the disciples first became his disciples?
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.000]   I mean, I could imagine, although the Bible didn't say it, that they were imagining that
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.040]   sin from the moment they followed Jesus, it will be smooth sailing for them.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.320]   Because they were with the king or the next leader.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:20.760]   They did not think they would be running for their lives.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   No.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:30.640]   That's probably the last thing they thought of when they thought of following a king.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.360]   And so aren't we just like the disciples?
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:40.960]   When we first believed in God, didn't we want to be aligned with higher power?
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.960]   What did that mean?
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:47.640]   Well, if you're with higher power, he's able to do things for you.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.720]   He's able to protect you when someone's attacking you.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.960]   And thank God we don't have many of that physically done, but maybe at your workplace.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.440]   Or he would be protecting you when something bad happened.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.880]   And if you're suffering, he would deliver you.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:11.160]   Isn't that why we too believed in Jesus at first?
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.640]   I mean, who here, you can raise your hand if that's you, believed in Jesus because you
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:20.520]   wanted to be fleeing away, running for your lives.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.960]   And more suffering entering into your lives.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   Anyone?
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.920]   Okay, that's what I thought.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.000]   You guys are quite logical people here.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.960]   And no, why is it?
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.800]   Well, this brings us to the first point.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.920]   In order so that we won't be trembling in any situation is that we need to know that
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.760]   God loves you beyond your expectations.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.320]   Now let's face it, you and I both have some sort of expectations for God.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:56.600]   Okay, they might be slightly different or vastly different, but you have your own thoughts
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.760]   about what God would look like, what he would do for you, right?
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:09.360]   And that is actually our own expectation of what God would be like.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.080]   And sometimes, you know, God's right on the dot, so we're joyful.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.720]   God did exactly, you know, as I prayed.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.480]   And then there are other times where it's so far off, we're wondering, "Jesus, did you
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.200]   get arrested again?"
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.400]   And sometimes we get so disappointed and scared to the point because we need to be facing
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   our own situations by ourselves that we might desert him like the disciples.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:46.960]   And in here, it actually recorded that Peter denied Jesus three times during the trial.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:56.000]   And sometimes when Jesus seems to be arrested in our situation, we begin to doubt.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.840]   We begin to question, "Is this the God that I thought he was?
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.440]   Is this the God?
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:09.360]   Is this really God at all?"
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:17.260]   But the truth is, and I want all of us to remember that truth, is that God loves you
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:23.120]   beyond your imagination, beyond what you think he would be.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.680]   Just because he's not acting the way that you expected, that does not mean he does not
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.680]   love you.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.840]   It does not mean that he is not God.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.600]   I remember the earlier passage when we read it.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:44.720]   It said that when Jesus was being arrested, he said, "So that the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.240]   Now what Scripture was he referring to?
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:52.160]   It's Isaiah 53, verse 7 to 12.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.120]   And I'm just going to read part of it.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:12:06.800]   "He was led like a lamb to the slaughterer, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.660]   So he did not open his mouth.
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.560]   For the transgression of my people, he was punished.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:21.000]   The Lord makes his life an offering for sin."
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.600]   You see, while the disciples thought that Jesus was being arrested, he was simply, not
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:40.000]   simply, he was actually fulfilling the Scriptures, the will of the Lord.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.200]   Now what is it that I want to say?
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:49.880]   Just because you think God should act like this, he should do that, and when he doesn't,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:56.760]   it doesn't mean that he doesn't have something better in mind.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.240]   And in this case, he had the best thing in mind, because while the disciples were only
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:08.200]   worrying about the King of Jews and trying to get their nations back together, Jesus
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:16.040]   was thinking about something greater, something that's eternal, that he would be a sin offering
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:25.680]   once and for all, so that one day when we're in judgment, that we would no longer need
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:35.960]   to be looked at as sinful, but that all our sins would be pardoned.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.120]   And sometimes I think we don't really, really, really understand it, and that includes myself
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.480]   as well.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.440]   I don't think we can really comprehend.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:52.440]   I often think that we're like a three-year-old, and we're trying to pray for a teddy bear,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.680]   "Oh, Father, I really want a teddy bear."
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.280]   And when God doesn't give us the teddy bear, we seem to kick and scream and say, "God,
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   you don't love me.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.040]   I just wanted the teddy bear.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.560]   I wanted nothing else, and you're withholding this from me."
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:12.600]   And whatever the situation you're facing, it's really real, and that's what's on your
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.400]   heart.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:24.240]   But I also feel that God just want to say, "My son, my daughter, there's a reason I'm
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.080]   not giving the teddy bear to you.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.960]   You might not understand, but you know what?
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:35.680]   I have a bank account loaded with money, okay?
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.800]   And you can buy as many teddy bears as you want."
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:43.080]   Now I'm using that analogy not to say that Jesus is going to pour out money to you.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   That's not the message.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.920]   Please don't get it wrong, and he might, but that's not what I'm saying.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:57.160]   What I'm saying is that our understanding and our focus is so narrow and small that
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:04.120]   we kick and scream when he has got this abundance for us, when he, here it says, that he has
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.740]   wiped out all our sins.
[00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:13.400]   And sometimes I think we cannot really comprehend that because the teddy bear is so real, and
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.720]   it's so important to us.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:23.160]   But when we grow up, we do understand what that million dollars mean, right?
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:27.840]   So one day, I always think when we're faced in judgment, we're like, "Oh my God, thank
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.280]   you, thank you."
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:36.400]   But at this moment, though, just wanted us to all hold onto the truth that God loves
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:42.480]   us, loves you beyond your expectations.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.360]   And don't let your expectations box in.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:52.920]   God, just because he doesn't act the way you expect, that means he doesn't love you, that
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.480]   means he's not God.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.440]   Seems pretty illogical if you think about it.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.000]   But that's how we feel a lot of the times.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.440]   And so when we tremble now at situations where it seems like God is not answering our prayers
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:19.600]   or not yet answering, we can hold onto this truth that he loves us beyond our expectation,
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.600]   and he will show us what's next.
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:35.240]   So don't let your expectations of who he is block you from seeing how much he loves you.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   Now as we look at Mark 15, Mark chapter 15, we know that he was brought before Pilate,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:50.980]   who was the Roman governor with authority to give sentence death.
[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:55.720]   Now even though he couldn't find any crime that he had committed, he didn't find any
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:02.920]   crime that Jesus did, but because of the pressure and how the crowd was pressuring him, that
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:12.480]   eventually he did allow a sentence death for Jesus.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.900]   And only because he called himself the King of Jews, and he was beaten and he was mocked,
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:25.240]   he was spat on, he was at his greatest hour of distress.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:31.720]   Now Mark didn't seem to record any of his disciples at this scene, but let's read a
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.400]   bit in verse 33.
[00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:40.320]   This is chapter 15, verse 33, which was what we saw earlier in the film.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:46.680]   At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:55.160]   And at three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Aloi, aloi, lama sabbatani,"
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:00.080]   which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:05.520]   And with a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.320]   The curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:17.700]   And when the centurion who stood there in front of Jesus saw how he died, he said, "Surely
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.880]   this man was the son of God."
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.640]   Now some women were watching from distance.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.600]   Some of them were Mary Madeline, Mary the mother of James the Younger, and of Joseph
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.820]   and Salome.
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:39.120]   Many other women who came up, who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.520]   Now there was darkness at noon.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:50.120]   It lasted for three hours, and at three, Jesus cried out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.120]   me?"
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:57.080]   Now this is actually a reference to Psalm 22, verse one, where there was a righteous
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.520]   man crying out, and he was suffering so much.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:09.440]   And actually in that Psalm, at the end, he said that his God would vindicate him.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:15.360]   So at the time when he was calling out, it wasn't just out of agony, but also referring
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:20.960]   that he knows that God would vindicate him as well.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:29.560]   And so he breathed his last breath, and then he died on the cross.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.880]   Now something interesting was revealed here.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.760]   Now the curtain was torn into two, from top to bottom.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.040]   Now what curtain is this?
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:43.080]   We can have a look at the temple.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:49.040]   As we see, the temple actually has, this is the floor plan of it, and there is a curtain
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.640]   that separates the Holy of Holies, which is the holiest place in the temple, aside from
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.560]   other places where they would be worshiping God.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:03.560]   It's so holy that only the high priest gets to go in once a year, and the other priests
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.800]   would be outside doing their daily offerings outside.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:14.580]   And so at three in the afternoon, that's the time when other priests would be outside doing
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.580]   other offerings.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:24.400]   They would be able to witness the supernatural torn tear of this curtain.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.400]   Now why is this important?
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:27.480]   Why did Mark put it in?
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.440]   Because he wanted to tell us that Jesus who died on the cross, he's just not any regular
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.880]   man.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.660]   He was the one who was able to bear all of our sins.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.880]   Because he was able to bear all of our sins before it required a priest who would represent
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.640]   the people to make an offering to God.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:54.560]   But if this curtain has been torn, it means that they no longer need to, through someone
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:01.320]   else, go to the Lord, go to God, but instead, because their sins were taken care of, that
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:08.600]   they have direct access, that we have direct access to God.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.800]   Now you might think, why is it important for us?
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:20.160]   Because we don't, right now when we pray, we can go directly to God.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:27.040]   But what we notice here is that all of this has happened, okay?
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:35.120]   This momentous moment, this moment where God is making history.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.800]   I want to ask, where are the disciples?
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   Where are they?
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.040]   Well, they fled.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:51.360]   Of course, in other accounts, we find that there are some disciples who are there, but
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:56.440]   in this account, there are none.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.640]   There are only the names of some women, okay?
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.080]   Now you're asking, why is this important for us to note?
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.960]   Well, think about this.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.240]   Jesus predicted his death to his disciples.
[00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.560]   Do you know how many times?
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.600]   Three times.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:23.920]   But he only disclosed it to his disciples, which meant that they had insider information.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.220]   They were the only ones who knew about this.
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.800]   But you know what?
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:35.120]   They were not able to recognize that Jesus, who is dying on the cross right now, who was
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.000]   dying on the cross then, was the son of God.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.760]   And neither were the women who had been with Jesus for all this time, who had ministered
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.400]   to him and who he ministered to.
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:54.160]   They also were not able to recognize that he is the son of God.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.520]   Now why is that?
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.840]   Jesus had been with them three years.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.320]   And yet the most ironic thing happens.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.880]   A centurion out of nowhere, now what is a centurion?
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:15.440]   A centurion is a Roman governor official who looked after about 100 soldiers.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:22.280]   Out of nowhere, with no context, no teaching from Jesus, don't even have a Jewish background,
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.480]   knows nothing about God.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:37.120]   And he, seeing how Jesus died, said, "Surely this is the son of God."
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.400]   How can that be?
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:50.120]   Well this gets to our second point, which is God reveals himself to whosoever will.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:59.080]   Now in the beginning, he only revealed himself to Jesus' disciples, the 12 of them.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:04.760]   Now when he was trialed, he revealed himself to more because he told them that, "Yes, I
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.960]   am the king of Jews."
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:16.440]   But now he is extending it to this centurion who's a Gentile, meaning not a Jewish, not
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:25.560]   within the nations where Jesus came from, that he is the son of God.
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.720]   So don't you see?
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.600]   Isn't that the same with us sometimes?
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:40.240]   When we think we know the Bible so well, we know who Jesus is, and actually we begin to
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:45.200]   box him in what we perceive him to be.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.800]   Because at that time when the disciples saw that Jesus was being crucified, this was so
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:58.120]   far off from their understanding of Jesus, that they could not recognize him.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:05.840]   They could not recognize that this, Jesus being crucified, was the son of God.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.040]   Now I'm not asking you to don't read the Bible.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:16.480]   What I'm saying is there are truths that only in the Bible we would find, but would we sometimes
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:28.720]   misinterpret it, and would we sometimes be boxing God into our way of how he would act?
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.240]   Because think about it.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.100]   The centurion had no background, no understanding.
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:42.480]   He simply saw what it was, and he was enlightened by God, that Jesus, who was crucified, is
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.660]   the son of God.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:52.380]   Now so we can easily miss the works of God if we're too quick to what?
[00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:58.420]   Jump to conclusions without knowledge and understanding of the Bible.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:06.200]   How we interpret it requires God to constantly help us.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.820]   Now I think if we put it in a little bit of a practical example, it would be Jesus, who's
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:15.640]   coming now, not like what they thought.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.900]   What is he coming now?
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:23.380]   He isn't that king that would ride on a white horse and start using his amazing powers to
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.420]   zap the enemies.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:37.180]   That's not how he came, but he came as the servant king to serve and not to be served.
[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:44.500]   And so our understanding of him sometimes would box him in.
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:51.540]   And so to help us a little with like a life example, well think about it.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.180]   I mean would we sometimes know where to serve?
[00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:00.100]   So what we do is we sign up for all the things that are the serving opportunities that the
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:05.500]   church has, and we're like very passionate when we go out there.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.600]   And then when your husband or your mother or your wife asks you, "Can you pass me that
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.020]   glass of water over there?"
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.020]   You're like, "Ah, no."
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.180]   You can get it yourself.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:20.060]   Because serving meant to go out, you know?
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:27.300]   But no, when we misinterpret it or when we box him in, yeah, it only limits to outside.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.900]   But it's inside as well.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:40.140]   And also, what about how Jesus extended this revelation that he is the son of God to a
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:44.180]   centurion, which is someone outside their group, right?
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:52.940]   Would we sometimes then be like this, where we see someone who's dressed nicely, that
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.300]   person looks rich, and we're thinking, "Oh, these are all nice people.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.180]   I'm going to tell them the good news."
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.180]   But you know what?
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.660]   That person, nah, like it's just an evil person.
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:10.020]   And we begin to limit what God might want to do.
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:17.800]   So what I want to say is God does things beyond our imagination, and we need to be careful
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.460]   not to jump to conclusions.
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:26.980]   Because if God wanted to come on a cross and die for us, I don't think there's anything
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.740]   outside of his imagination.
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.500]   And we can't really keep up sometimes.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:38.100]   So just be open-minded as well about what God's doing.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:42.060]   Don't be too quick to judge if that's how God's doing things.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:44.460]   I mean, that might include just ordinary things.
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:48.700]   We might look at another church and how they do things, and we might say, "Oh, that's not
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.700]   how to do it.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.180]   God doesn't want it to be done this way.
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.420]   Those hymns, they're outdated.
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.780]   Oh, these contemporary music, oh, they're too loud."
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:06.540]   Or we might start to think, "Oh, this raising hand, oh, this is too much.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.620]   You know, oh, this is too little."
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:12.900]   And we might start to think, "Oh, this is how to do small groups.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.220]   No, we should have a big fellowship."
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.100]   And we find ourselves just thinking about all these things.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.500]   And we might be thinking, "These etiquettes are good."
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.260]   And other people think etiquettes, they're out of date.
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:30.060]   Speaking in tongues, you know, that's definitely have ended.
[00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.060]   No, it's still happening here.
[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:35.260]   And healing, you know, that has stopped.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:36.860]   Don't have any healing prayers.
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.940]   No, it's happening.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.660]   And so, you know what?
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:47.420]   When we're thinking about all that things in our head, what you find is that we might
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:53.740]   have a newcomer who comes into our service, and then at the end of it, while we're still
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:30:02.380]   trying to judge what God's trying to do, that newcomer may say, "Ah, I felt the presence
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:05.740]   of God."
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:13.660]   So what I want to say is that don't let our understanding of God, don't let our knowledge
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.140]   or our interpretation of it limit what God's doing.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.420]   I don't know what He's doing, but let's try to keep up with Him.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.820]   Apparently, He's very creative, as we can see, and He's God.
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:32.660]   And He's gonna do things outside our imagination.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:43.040]   So now, I really want a moment for us to just think about, rather or not, we ourselves have
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:44.440]   boxed God in.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.220]   And today is an Easter Saturday.
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:56.300]   I just wanted us to reflect, has there been moments where we said, "If you were God, you
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.460]   would do this."
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:06.060]   And has there been moments where, "Since you didn't do this, I don't think you are God."
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:12.260]   And I just want us to reflect, maybe even today as you walked in, you know, you just
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.260]   thought, "Oh, this is gonna be another service.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.980]   I'm just gonna hear and I'm gonna go."
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:29.900]   But what if, what if God at this time is convicting you to believe in Him, or convicting you again
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:37.700]   that in your doubts, "I, He is still loving you."
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.980]   Now in a moment, Pastor John will be leading us in communion.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:51.140]   And I just wanted us to kind of think about how we, as we expect, and we have expectations
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:32:03.220]   of who Jesus is, and how that has really affected us in believing simply, maybe like the centurion,
[00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:09.220]   "Surely this is the Son of God."
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:14.580]   And so in a moment, I'll be praying a prayer for all of us.
[00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:21.940]   And I would invite you at that time, if God has convicted you in any way today, rather
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:29.260]   it be that you see for the first time that Jesus who was crucified was actually the Son
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.060]   of God.
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:39.180]   Or maybe you had walked away for some time because you think that Jesus had disappointed
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:48.300]   you, but today His Spirit is reminding you that He loves you, and you're convicted by
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.300]   that.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:57.540]   I want you to respond later by simply in your heart telling Jesus that you believe in Him,
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.780]   that He is the Son of God.
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:07.340]   So if there's any way, and I'm even limiting God when I name out those scenarios.
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:17.460]   So whatever it is, in whatever way, if Jesus is convicting you right now, that as we pray
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:25.100]   together and as you truly believe that Jesus who has died on the cross has taken away your
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:32.860]   sins and that He is the Son of God and He loves you and you're willing to give Him all
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.020]   your sins and follow Him.
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:41.500]   And when we pray and ask you to respond, simply respond in your heart and pray to Him because
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.060]   He's listening.
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.540]   He can hear you.
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.820]   Let us pray together now.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:53.900]   Oh, dear Heavenly Father.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:59.500]   How many times have we boxed you in?
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:08.300]   How many times have we misunderstood you and thought that you're not God or that you don't
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.820]   love us?
[00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:19.580]   And how many times, Father, do we still be slow to understand like the disciples when
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:27.340]   you've told us again and again about what to happen and we still don't get it?
[00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:31.940]   Father, we pray for your spirit to work.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:43.380]   The centurion was able to receive this knowledge that the disciples couldn't in three years.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.100]   And maybe there are many of us here today.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.580]   We just can't comprehend it.
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:35:00.580]   But, Father, we pray that your spirit now would convict them, convict us that Jesus
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:07.620]   is the Son of God, came to die for our sins and He loves us.
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:16.140]   He loves us so much that He's willing to walk onto the cross willingly like a lamb that's
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:21.340]   about to be slaughtered.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:27.940]   And so now I invite you, if your heart is convicted of this truth, that you just tell
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:34.420]   Him, "Lord, I believe that you're the Son of God.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.480]   I want to give you my life."
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:45.980]   Even if you're a Christian who has walked away, you can still say the same prayer.
[00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:54.540]   Or even if you have been a Christian following God, but you had expectations and you wanted
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.940]   to repent of that, you can do that too.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:03.940]   Just going to take a moment here where it's just you and God.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
