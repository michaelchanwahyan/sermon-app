[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.600]  Good morning, Explorers.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.440]  Today's sermon asks a simple question.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.000]  Are you a growing Christian?
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500]  Let me repeat that.
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000]  Are you a growing Christian?
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.500]  I want to start with a personal story.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.100]  I've not always been a pastor.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.900]  When I came to Hong Kong in 1987,
[00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.400]  yes, I know it was before you were born,
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.400]  except Pastor Johnny,
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400]  I was a businessman.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.900]  And you'll see a picture of me as a businessman.
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.900]  In 1995,
[00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.900]  I joined a church
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.900]  that was called Repulse Bay Baptist Church.
[00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.900]  The pastor, who was an Aussie,
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.900]  was a good friend.
[00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.900]  Now, there were two problems about that church.
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.900]  Firstly, it wasn't in Repulse Bay.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.900]  And secondly, it wasn't a Baptist church.
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.900]  The next problem is that the pastor left in 1996.
[00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.900]  And we were left with a church with a silly name,
[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.900]  no pastor, about 40 people, and no money.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.900]  I remember preaching a sermon in December 1996
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900]  on John chapter 15,
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.900]  the chapter where Jesus spoke about being the vine and us being the branches.
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.900]  I remember it well.
[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900]  I mentioned in this chapter
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.900]  that this chapter called for a church that was Christ-centered,
[00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:09.900]  abiding in Him, relationship-based, fruitful, and poured out.
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:17.900]  You can see the analogy between the vine and church.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.900]  Anyway, we decided in January 1997,
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.900]  as the church wasn't in Repulse Bay,
[00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900]  and it wasn't a Baptist church,
[00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900]  to change its name.
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.900]  And given my sermon weeks before,
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.900]  the name "The Vine" was chosen.
[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.900]  Little did I know then
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.900]  that I would become its first senior pastor.
[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.900]  The rest, as they say, is history.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.900]  And for the past five years,
[00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.900]  I've been honored to be part of the team here at KFC.
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.900]  And it is my honor to speak to explorers,
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.900]  as I have a heart for the future generation.
[00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.900]  At the beginning, I asked a simple question.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.900]  Are you a growing Christian?
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.900]  Now, if I offered you a measuring device
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.900]  designed to measure spiritual growth in a believer's life,
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.900]  what would you find?
[00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.900]  Today, we have all sorts of fancy gadgets
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.900]  that can measure just about anything.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.900]  For instance, they can measure our height, our weight,
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.900]  including the amount of body fat that we have
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.900]  versus the amount of muscle.
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.900]  We can measure our cholesterol level,
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.900]  our blood pressure, our sugar level,
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.900]  and so many things.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.900]  We can diagnose everything about us physically,
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.900]  but today I want to give you a tool
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.900]  that can help you measure
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.900]  how well you are doing spiritually.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.900]  In fact, I want to give you four spiritual tools
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.900]  called disciplines
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.900]  that can help you measure how you are doing spiritually.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.900]  Open your Bibles or your smartphones
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.900]  to John's Gospel, chapter 15.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.900]  I'm going to read the first eight verses
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.900]  of this wonderful, transforming chapter of God's Word,
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.900]  the chapter that gave the church the name "Divine" 24 years ago.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.900]  Let's start off with the first five verses.
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.900]  This is Jesus speaking.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.900]  I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinedresser.
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.900]  Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, He takes away,
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.900]  and every branch that does bear fruit, He prunes,
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.900]  that it might bear more fruit.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.900]  Already you are clean because of the word I have spoken to you.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.900]  Abide in me.
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.900]  And I in you.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.900]  As the branch cannot bear fruit by itselfunless it abides in the vine,
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.900]  neither can you unless you abide in me.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.900]  I am the vine.
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.900]  You are the branches.
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.900]  Whoever abides in me, and I in him,
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.900]  he it is that bears much fruit.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.900]  For apart from me, you can do nothing.
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.900]  Our Lord Jesus Christ taught His disciples
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.900]  that the key to spiritual growth is
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.900]  Now get this, now get this.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.900]  The key to spiritual growth is abiding in Him.
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.900]  He said in verse 5,
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.900]  six words that can change the way you live your Christian life.
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.900]  Without me, you can do nothing.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.900]  Until you come to terms with the reality
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.900]  of your need to abide daily with Christ,
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.900]  you'll always be a yo-yo Christian,
[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.900]  up and down, up and down,
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.900]  up one minute, down the next.
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.900]  On fire for God one day,
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.900]  and burned out the next.
[00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.900]  I believe that many Christians today
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.900]  can be found living in two extremes.
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.900]  On one hand, there are those Christians
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.900]  who are what I call active but empty.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.900]  And secondly, there are Christian church members today
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.900]  who are apathetic and empty.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.900]  That's right.
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:17.900]  I believe Christians who are in an all out sprint
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.900]  can just be as empty in their lives
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.900]  as Christians who are watching from the sidelines.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.900]  You see, we've lost our focus
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.900]  on what it takes to be a growing believer.
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.900]  We're engaged either in activity or passivity.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:46.900]  When what God truly wants is for us to be abiding.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:54.900]  Abiding in Christ means to remain in,
[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.900]  to stay in, or even continue in
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.900]  a constant continuing, committed, concentrated,
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.900]  called out relationship with Jesus Christ as Lord.
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:13.900]  So what are the tools or spiritual disciplines
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.900]  we need to measure our Christian growth?
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:26.900]  Firstly, the spiritual discipline of abiding in the word.
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.900]  John 15,7.
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.900]  Look at John 15,7.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.900]  Jesus said, "If you abide in me,
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.900]  and my words abide in you."
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.900]  Stop reading right there.
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.900]  Jesus is telling us
[00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.900]  if we want to be a growing believer,
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.900]  a disciple, we must abide in his word.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:57.900]  In John chapter 8, verses 31 and 32,
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.900]  the Bible tells us.
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.900]  So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him,
[00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.900]  "If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:07.900]  and you will know the truth,
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.900]  and the truth will set you free."
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.900]  The way to have Christ living in us
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.900]  is to have the word in us.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.900]  The word is food to us.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.900]  Matthew 4,4 says this,
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.900]  "But he answered, 'It is written,
[00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.900]  "Man shall not live by bread alone,
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.900]  but by every word that comes from the mouth of God."
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.900]  And Romans 10,17 says,
[00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.900]  "So faith comes by hearing,
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:43.900]  and hearing through the word of God."
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.900]  Those words, "Faith comes by hearing,"
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.900]  are really special to us here at Confluct Church.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.900]  We're currently part of the ONE campaign,
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.900]  which is happening all around the world.
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.900]  I found out this week that 183 countries around the world
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.900]  are taking part in the ONE campaign,
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.900]  and there's only 195 countries in the world.
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.900]  And we have a vision, don't we,
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.900]  to take the gospel to the whole world by 2033,
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.900]  that the gospel will be available in every language,
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.900]  and we are part of that.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.900]  Now we receive the word in many ways.
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.900]  Number one, listening to the word of God taught or preached.
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.900]  I hope you're hearing the voice of God this morning.
[00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.900]  Secondly, reading the word of God,
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.900]  including orally listening to the word of God.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.900]  Number three, studying the word of God.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:40.900]  Number four, memorizing the word of God.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.900]  Number five, meditating on the word of God.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.900]  And number six, and probably most importantly,
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:51.900]  applying the word of God to our lives.
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:55.900]  Now notice I've done something on the slides
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.900]  to help you and understand,
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.900]  remember these four spiritual disciplines
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.900]  necessary to grow as a believer.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.900]  I have presented the first discipline
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.900]  in the lower vertical portion of the cross.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.900]  That indicates just how we are to abide in Christ,
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.900]  by abiding in his word here on earth.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:25.900]  His word enables us to live for Christ effectively.
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.900]  Psalm 119 says,
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.900]  I have stored your word in my heart
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.900]  that I might not sin against you.
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.900]  Other versions say,
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.900]  I have hidden your word in my heart.
[00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.900]  How are you doing?
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.900]  Do you love God's word?
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.900]  Do you read it?
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.900]  Do you study it?
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.900]  Memorize it?
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.900]  Do you live it?
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.900]  Do you obey God's word?
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.900]  Abiding in God's word
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.900]  means we live the word
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.900]  as much as we read the word.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.900]  God's word has the power
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.900]  to transform your life.
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.900]  Its teachings will radically change
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.900]  your thinking and thus,
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.900]  your lifestyle.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.900]  Number two,
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.900]  the spiritual discipline
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.900]  of praying in the faith.
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.900]  Again, verse 7,
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.900]  if you abide in me and my words abide in you,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.900]  you will ask what you desire
[00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.900]  and it shall be done for you.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:35.900]  Another important discipline
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:37.900]  necessary for Christian growth
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.900]  is praying in faith.
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.900]  Look again at verse 7.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.900]  And this time,
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.900]  let's read the whole verse.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.900]  If you abide in me,
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.900]  my words abide with you,
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.900]  you will ask what you desire
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.900]  and it shall be done for you.
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.900]  A growing Christian
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.900]  should have or should be developing
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.900]  and maintaining a lifestyle of praying.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.900]  So how do we pray?
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:08.900]  Matthew chapter 6.
[00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:10.900]  Jesus said,
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:11.900]  when you pray,
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.900]  by the way,
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.900]  he didn't say if you pray.
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:15.900]  He said,
[00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:16.900]  when you pray,
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.900]  don't be like the hypocrite
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.900]  who love to pray publicly
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.900]  on street corners
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.900]  and in the synagogue
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.900]  where everyone can see them.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.900]  I assure you,
[00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.900]  that is all the reward
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:30.900]  they will ever get.
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.900]  But when you pray,
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.900]  go away by yourself,
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.900]  shut the door behind you
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:37.900]  and pray to your Father
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.900]  secretly.
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:40.900]  Then your Father
[00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:43.900]  who knows all secrets
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.900]  will reward you.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.900]  I got six observations.
[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.900]  Number one,
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.900]  Jesus assumes that
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.900]  as his children,
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.900]  we will pray.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.900]  When you pray,
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.900]  as I said.
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.900]  Secondly,
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.900]  pray to God the Father,
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.900]  not to be heard of men.
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.900]  Number three,
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.900]  have a private
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.900]  place of prayer.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.900]  Some of us call it
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.900]  a prayer closet.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.900]  Number four,
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.900]  be consistent.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.900]  Number five,
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.900]  keep a prayer journal.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.900]  And then when the prayers
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.900]  are answered,
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.900]  you can tick them off.
[00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.900]  And number six is
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.900]  follow a pattern of prayer.
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:26.900]  And there are different
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.900]  patterns of prayer.
[00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:28.900]  You can pray according
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.900]  to the Lord prayer.
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:30.900]  Our Father in heaven,
[00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.900]  Hallowed be your name,
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.900]  etc.
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.900]  Or you can pray
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.900]  according to
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.900]  what I call acts.
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.900]  ACTS.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.900]  I put them on the screen.
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.900]  Adoration,
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.900]  confession,
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.900]  thanksgiving,
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.900]  supplication.
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.900]  That's a long word
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:46.900]  that basically means asking.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.900]  Now notice the upper
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.900]  vertical portion of the cross
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.900]  points upward to heaven or God
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.900]  and indicates the way
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.900]  we communicate with God
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:01.900]  through prayer and faith.
[00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.900]  Number three,
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.900]  you still with me?
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.900]  Good.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.900]  The spiritual discipline
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.900]  of fellowshipping with believers.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.900]  Fellowshipping,
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.900]  and I know it's difficult
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.900]  in this Zoom period.
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.900]  It refers to the special relationship
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.900]  we share with all other believers.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.900]  All true Christians
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:26.900]  have a fellowship,
[00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:28.900]  a true partnership
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:29.900]  with other believers.
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.900]  Our mutual faith
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.900]  in Christ builds a bond
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.900]  of communion and commitment
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.900]  with one another.
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.900]  We need one another.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.900]  We are a family.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.900]  You are my brothers and sisters.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.900]  Abiding in Christ
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.900]  means we will seek to live
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:55.900]  in fellowship with our brothers
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.900]  and sisters in Christ.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.900]  John 13 says this,
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.900]  A new commandment I give you,
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:03.900]  that you love one another
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.900]  just as I have loved you.
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:07.900]  You are to love one another.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.900]  By this all men will know
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.900]  that you are my disciples
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:15.900]  if you have love for one another.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.900]  God has provided a home
[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.900]  for his children.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.900]  It's called the church.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.900]  He has provided explorers.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.900]  He has even given us the T-shirt.
[00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:34.900]  The church is the place
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.900]  where relationships are nurtured,
[00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.900]  where love is expressed,
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.900]  compassion shared,
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.900]  encouragement given
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.900]  and acceptance offered.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.900]  It is the beginning point of ministry.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.900]  It is the body of Christ
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.900]  here on earth,
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.900]  a living, growing body.
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.900]  If you are to abide in Christ,
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.900]  you must abide in his church.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.900]  You will never find
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.900]  a well-balanced Christian
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.900]  who is not involved in the church
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.900]  of Lord Jesus Christ somewhere.
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:11.900]  Now notice the word fellowship
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.900]  is written on the right side
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.900]  of the horizontal portion of the cross.
[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.900]  The horizontal part of the cross
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:23.900]  represents the important relationship
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.900]  we Christians are to have with others.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.900]  Just as the vertical part of the cross
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.900]  points to our relationship with God,
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.900]  so the horizontal part
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.900]  indicates the importance
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:38.900]  of our relationship with others
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.900]  if we are to be growing disciples.
[00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:46.900]  Not only are we to have relationship
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.900]  with other believers through the church
[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.900]  called fellowship,
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.900]  but we are also to have a relationship
[00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.900]  with unbelievers in the world
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.900]  and that's called witnessing.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.900]  That leads me to my last point.
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.900]  Number four,
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.900]  the spiritual discipline
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.900]  of witnessing to the world.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.900]  Verse 8.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.900]  By this my father is glorified
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.900]  that you bear much fruit
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.900]  so you will be my disciples.
[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.900]  Jesus said that the way
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.900]  to show that we are disciples
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.900]  is to bear much fruit.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.900]  That's why I loved
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.900]  the picture of the grapes.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.900]  Witnessing is the natural outgoing,
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.900]  is the natural outgrowth
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.900]  of the abiding and growing Christian life.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.900]  If we are to live in his word,
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.900]  pray in faith,
[00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.900]  and fellowship with believers,
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:50.900]  it will be natural and normal
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.900]  to share with others
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.900]  what Christ is doing in our lives.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:56.900]  In fact,
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.900]  you won't be able to help
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:02.900]  but share or witness to those around you.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:06.900]  Bearing fruit is more than witnessing,
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.900]  but it always involves witnessing.
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.900]  Jesus said to his first disciples
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.900]  who were all fishermen,
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.900]  I will make you fishers of men.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.900]  Jesus also said,
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.900]  you shall be my witnesses.
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:28.900]  Are you a witness for Christ?
[00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.900]  Now notice once again
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.900]  that the first two spiritual disciplines
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.900]  deal with our relationship to God.
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.900]  That relationship is represented
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.900]  by a vertical relationship.
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.900]  When we hear the word,
[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.900]  God speaks to us.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.900]  When we pray,
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.900]  we speak to God.
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.900]  The last two spiritual disciplines
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.900]  deal with our relationship to fellow men.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.900]  This is a horizontal relationship
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.900]  between a believer,
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:01.900]  the church and the world.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.900]  When we faithfully attend church
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:04.900]  with other believers,
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.900]  when we are faithful to share Christ
[00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.900]  with the lost,
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.900]  then we are witnessing to the world.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.900]  If you truly desire
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.900]  to develop a close growing relationship
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.900]  with Christ,
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:24.900]  then learn to put into spiritual practice
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.900]  the disciplines of,
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:31.900]  number one, living in the word,
[00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.900]  Bible study.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.900]  Number two, praying in faith,
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.900]  prayer.
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.900]  Number three,
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.900]  fellowshipping with believers,
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.900]  faithful, consistent, regular attendance
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:49.900]  in God's church,
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.900]  even if it's online.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.900]  And lastly,
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.900]  witnessing to the world,
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.900]  sharing your faith with others.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.900]  I want to give you a word of warning,
[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.900]  however.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:07.900]  As important as these activities may be,
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.900]  they are not what Jesus says
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.900]  makes you a Christian.
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.900]  You can read the Bible from cover to cover.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.900]  You can go to church every week
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.900]  for the rest of your life,
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.900]  and it won't guarantee
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.900]  a healthy relationship with God.
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.900]  Jesus is open in words
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.900]  to his disciples with ease.
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.900]  Follow me.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.900]  He described as Christian
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.900]  people when he said,
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.900]  my people recognize my voice.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.900]  I know them,
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.900]  and they follow.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.900]  The essence of being a Christian for Jesus
[00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.900]  was to hear and to heed the voice of God.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.900]  The process involved
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:59.900]  taking up your own cross,
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.900]  denying yourself,
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.900]  and losing your life
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.900]  in order to find it.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.900]  I've got a new word for you.
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.900]  Followship.
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.900]  The process of followship
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.900]  didn't look the same for everyone.
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.900]  What Jesus said to the apostle Peter
[00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.900]  was different from what he said
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:22.900]  to the apostle John.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.900]  But as the disciples
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.900]  responded to Jesus' word,
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.900]  they got to know God
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:31.900]  and his kingdom ways.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.900]  The key to your growth
[00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.900]  is to get to know God
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.900]  and his kingdom ways.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.900]  And I want to pray for you right now.
[00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.900]  Before I pray for you,
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.900]  I do realize that there might be
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.900]  people watching
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.900]  for whom measuring
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:58.900]  your spiritual discipline
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:00.900]  cannot be done.
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.900]  Just as I cannot measure
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.900]  my fitness levels without
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.900]  my steps without a Fitbit
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.900]  or a smartphone,
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.900]  you cannot begin to measure
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.900]  your spiritual fitness
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.900]  without being attached
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.900]  to the true vine,
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.900]  Jesus Christ.
[00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.900]  You don't have yet
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:24.900]  a personal relationship
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.900]  with Jesus Christ.
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.900]  He is not your Lord and Savior.
[00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.900]  Yet.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.900]  I say yet.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:38.900]  I want to challenge you.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.900]  You need to come before the cross.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.900]  The cross that you see on the slide.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.900]  Look at it.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:54.900]  Confess the things that you've done wrong
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.900]  and your need for forgiveness.
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.900]  Receive him.
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.900]  And choose to follow him.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.900]  Can I ask everyone,
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.900]  wherever you are,
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.900]  just to close your eyes for a moment.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.900]  And I want to give anybody
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.900]  who's watching online
[00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.900]  that opportunity
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.900]  to come to the cross,
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.900]  to confess your sins,
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.900]  to ask for forgiveness
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.900]  and ask Jesus
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.900]  to become your personal Savior.
[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.900]  I'm not talking about your friend here,
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.900]  your brother or your sister.
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.900]  I'm talking about you.
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.900]  If you haven't taken that step yet,
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:44.900]  would you pray this prayer with me?
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.900]  Dear Heavenly Father,
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.900]  I come before you now
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:51.900]  and I recognize
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:54.900]  my need of your Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.900]  I believe Jesus Christ.
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.900]  You went to the cross for me
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.900]  and you died for my sins.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.900]  I confess.
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.900]  I have done things wrong.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.900]  In thought, word and deed.
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.900]  I need your forgiveness.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.900]  Today, I come to your cross.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.900]  I ask for your forgiveness.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.900]  I ask you to come into my life
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.900]  and fill me with your Spirit.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.900]  Lord Jesus,
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.900]  I receive your free gift of eternal life.
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.900]  I am yours
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.900]  and I will be
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.900]  forever and ever.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.900]  Amen.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.900]  And if you prayed that prayer,
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.900]  please tell someone.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.900]  Either go on the chat line
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.900]  or tell your Explorers leaders.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.900]  Tell someone that you prayed this prayer.
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.900]  I'm not finished yet.
[00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.900]  I want to pray for all of us.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.900]  This area of spiritual growth is not an easy area.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.900]  We're all faced with the compromises of the world.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:00.900]  We're faced at the moment with COVID.
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.900]  Before that, we were faced with the political situation.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.900]  It is not easy
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:10.900]  to grow as a Christian.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.900]  I want to pray for you now.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.900]  I want you to go back on this talk.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.900]  Maybe listen to it again.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.900]  Take down the notes from the slides.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.900]  I'll ask Carmen and leaders to send you copies of the slides.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.900]  And I want to pray for you
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.900]  that you would grow as a believer.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:31.900]  Let's all pray together.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.900]  Father God, I thank you for today.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.900]  I thank you that you've shown us
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.900]  that Jesus is the true vine.
[00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.900]  We are the branches.
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:42.900]  And I thank you for these four ways
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.900]  that you've shown us to grow in Him.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:51.900]  I pray, Lord, that you'd give us the discipline, the will.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.900]  Lord, that you'd make the time available for us
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.900]  that maybe we turn off Netflix for a moment
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.900]  and look in your word, seek your face.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.900]  And I pray, Lord, that you'd raise us up.
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.900]  Lord, not as believers, but as the true disciples.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.900]  And I pray that everyone who is online this morning
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:18.900]  will grow into a true disciple of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.900]  Amen.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.900]  Thank you for listening to me.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.900]  I hope it's not too long
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.900]  before I get a chance to speak to you again.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.900]  God bless you, Explorers.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.900]  (字幕製作:貝爾)
