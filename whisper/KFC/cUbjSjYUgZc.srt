00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,560
 Good evening everyone. Welcome to KFCI online service. My name is Michelle and I serve as

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,600
 one of the pastors here. We're so glad that you've tuned in so that we can worship God

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,840
 together. Now today we're very excited because we are going to be listening to a sermon on

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,480
 how to cross the generations. Now many a times we do want to connect with people who are

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,320
 in different generations than we are, but we just don't know how. And yet we know that

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,240
 it is in God's heart for us to be united as one so that we can praise and worship Him

7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:49,000
 together. Now before we get to that sermon, I do want to read for us from Psalm 145 verse

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,960
 1 to 5. So please follow along and see how God is speaking to you today. Psalm 145 verse

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:11,240
 1. I will exalt you, my God the King. I will praise your name forever and ever. Every day

10
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:19,960
 I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever. Great is the Lord and most worthy

11
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:29,480
 of praise. His greatness no one can fathom. One generation commands your works to another.

12
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:38,760
 They tell of your mighty acts. They speak of the glorious splendor of your majesty.

13
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,640
 Now let us turn our hearts to worship Him with music and with songs.

14
00:01:43,640 --> 00:02:11,400
 [Music]

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:33,880
 Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come quickly,

16
00:02:33,880 --> 00:03:01,880
 your will be done, on earth as it is. In heaven, let heaven come to earth as it is.

17
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:11,880

 Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come quickly,

21
00:03:45,880 --> 00:04:13,880
 your will be done, we sing on earth as it is. In heaven, let heaven come to earth as it is.

22
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:25,880
 In heaven, let heaven come.

106
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:55,880
 Forever all my days, I will love you God.

107
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:05,880
 Wow, that was a wonderful worship.

108
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,880
 And at this time I do want to share with you about some things that have been happening at KFCI.

109
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,880
 And also some other events that I think you'll be very interested in.

110
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,880
 So now let us watch KFCI announcements together.

 [Music]

120
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,880
 After a long day, do you feel empty and unfulfilled?

121
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,880
 There's more to life than this.

122
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,880
 Come join us at Alpha as we discuss life questions.

123
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,880
 Why are we here?

124
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,880
 Is there more to life than this?

125
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,880
 Does God have a purpose for me?

126
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,880
 Come join us and we will discover more.

127
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,880
 [Music]

128
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,880
 Fear and fear have creeped our city.

129
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:25,880
 As God's people, it is time to stand and fast for our city, our home, our people.

130
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,880
 This is a spiritual battle.

131
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,880
 The enemy wants to kill, steal, and destroy.

132
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,880
 But remember, our God is for us.

133
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,880
 Our God is for us.

134
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,880
 Let's stand to the gap of fasting and prayer to cover the city.

135
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,880
 Oh Lord, let faith arise.

136
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,880
 Let faith arise.

137
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
 In Jesus' name.

138
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,880
 [Music]

139
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,880
 As you've just heard from our announcements,

140
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,880
 we do hope that you come and join Alpha and also for the fast.

141
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,880
 Now, if you're new to our church or if you're visiting or haven't been connecting with us for some time,

142
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,880
 please use this time to scan the QR code and also really to let us know how you're doing

143
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880

144
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,880
 And at the same time, once we've received your information,

145
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,880
 we can reach out to you and give you some information about some upcoming events that are happening here.

146
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,880
 At the same time, we're very hopeful that we can meet in person very soon.

147
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,880
 So please watch for our latest update in our website.

148
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,880
 Now, at this time, we want to watch a video together in which we've interviewed a few people

149
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,880
 to get out their thoughts on what bridging the generations look like.

150
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,880
 Hello, church. We're here at KFCI. We've got Carmen with us today.

151
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
 Carmen, I just wanted to ask,

152
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,880
 what do you think is the most important thing to bridge the gap between the different generations?

153
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,880
 So understanding is the most important thing, which I think,

154
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,880
 because I love to have my thoughts to be understood by my parents

155
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
 and also maybe people who are older than me.

156
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,880
 I think, yeah, understanding is a very important one.

157
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,880
 Yeah, I think that's a great one, Carmen. Let's see what other people have to say.

158
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,880
 The most important part about crossing generations is acceptance.

159
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,880
 Because while you might not agree with the other person's views,

160
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,880
 you can accept them and love them despite of it.

161
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,880
 We have to care about the older generations and learn from them

162
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,880
 so that we can set an example for the youngest generation.

163
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
 To show Christ's love to our next generations.

164
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,880
 So we have to give them this kind of trust and respect and understanding.

165
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,880
 You need to have guts. If you don't have guts, pray to God and he'll give you wisdom.

166
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,880
 We all need the courage and step up to talk to them.

167
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,880
 We need all generations working together

168
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,880
 because the older generations have a lot of experience more than the younger ones

169
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,880
 and they're eager to listen and learn from the older generations.

170
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,880
 I firmly believe that united single-minded passion for the glory of God

171
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,880
 is essential for crossing generations.

172
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,880
 The worship of God, that is God getting the praise and honor that he deserves

173
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,880
 and us having our deepest wants and needs satisfied in him.

174
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,880
 I think that what crossing generations really means is

175
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,880
 understanding those differences and those different struggles

176
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,880
 and seeing how each generation tackles them in a different way

177
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,880
 and learning from that and learning from one another in that way.

178
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,880
 I strongly believe you need to be low.

179
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,880
 Now we're going to pray for the generations.

180
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,880
 And firstly I'd like to pray for the younger generation.

181
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,880
 Father God, we thank you, Lord, for the younger generation.

182
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,880
 We thank you, Lord, for the life that we see within them.

183
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,880
 We thank you for their vitality, for their zeal for you.

184
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,880
 I pray, Lord, that we as the older generation would recognize the gifts,

185
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,880
 the talents of our young generation and that we would empower them.

186
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,880
 Lord, that we would work together for your glory.

187
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,880
 And I just bless the younger generation of this church and this city

188
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,880
 to know their God, to know who they are, to know their identity,

189
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,880
 that they are sons and daughters of the living God.

190
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:45,880
 And as I pray for Bonnie, Lord, I pray for all of our young people.

191
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,880
 Lord, that each one of them, I call them now into the destiny

192
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
 that you have prepared for them.

193
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,880
 Lord, prepare them for the future.

194
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,880
 But Lord, use them in the present, in Jesus' name.

195
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,880
 Amen.

196
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,880
 Lord, just thank you for John, Lord.

197
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,880
 Thank you for so many others like him who are really passionate

198
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,880
 about reaching out to the younger generation, Lord,

199
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,880
 who are really ready to just teach and just equip the younger generation

200
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,880
 to allow them to move into their calling as future leaders, Lord.

201
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,880
 I just pray for the older generation, Lord.

202
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
 I thank you for their passion for you.

203
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,880
 I thank you for their experience, for their zeal,

204
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,880
 for their dedication towards you as your loyal servants, Lord.

205
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,880
 So Lord, I just pray for them.

206
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,880
 I pray that, yeah, Lord, that you would really give them the patience

207
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,880
 and the wisdom to keep leading this younger generation, Lord,

208
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,880
 to be able to pass on their years of service to us, Lord.

209
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,880
 And I also pray, Lord, that you would keep them and bless them.

210
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,880
 And just, yeah, Lord, just pour your blessings over them

211
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,880
 and their children and their children, Lord.

212
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,880
 I just pray all this in your wonderful name, Lord,

213
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,880
 and I pray this in the name of Lord Jesus.

214
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,880
 Amen.

215
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,880
 It's great that we've been able to pray.

216
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,880
 Our other prayer is that God would use us as a team,

217
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,880
 the younger generation and the older generation, together.

218
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,880
 And now we're going to pass over to Pastor James for our sermon.

219
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,880
 [Pastor James]

220
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,880
 Good evening, everyone.

221
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,880
 It's a joy to be able to bring you the Word today.

222
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,880
 And we are so missing everyone just being able to gather,

223
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,880
 and we are really, really close now.

224
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,880
 We're praying that in these coming weeks we will have a chance to just be together again.

225
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,880
 Today I'm going to be talking about how we cross generations.

226
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,880
 You know, coming to Hong Kong, one of the biggest inspirations for me

227
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,880
 has been meeting Pastor John and Pastor Peter,

228
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,880
 who have this vision to embrace this next generation.

229
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,880
 And this last year, the next generation have had a torch shone on them

230
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,880
 because the next generation are showing some of the feelings

231
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,880
 or the frustrations they have about their future.

232
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,880
 And we know that the next generation that is coming up in Hong Kong

233
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,880
 is in deep need of the Gospel, in deep need of hope

234
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,880
 and being told that everything is going to be okay.

235
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,880
 And so for us as a church, the question really remains is

236
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,880
 how do we serve this next generation?

237
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,880
 How do we cross generations in our ministries?

238
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,880
 And in my work with Young Life now, that is what it's all about.

239
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,880
 How do we introduce the next generation to Jesus Christ?

240
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,880
 And then for a parachurch, how do we work together with the church,

241
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,880
 all being a part of the body of Christ in solving this problem?

242
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,880
 For me, as we talk about how to cross generations,

243
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,880
 the first thing we need to think about is before we even get to the solution,

244
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
 we first need to understand the problem.

245
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,880
 And the problem is this.

246
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,880
 There is difficulty with doing next generation work

247
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,880
 because there is such a thing as a generation gap.

248
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,880
 The generation gap is there because generations are simply different.

249
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,880
 And they've always been different since the beginning of mankind.

250
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,880
 But they've been even more amplified now because of technology,

251
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,880
 because of globalization.

252
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,880
 So what we have now are generations are becoming so divided

253
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,880
 in their way of thinking and their way of acting.

254
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,880
 For example, we have a generation called the Baby Boomers

255
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,880
 who are on the whole born in between the '40s and the '60s.

256
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,880
 A lot of the current society's leaders are part of this generation.

257
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,880
 And this generation, the Baby Boomers, they come from a time

258
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,880
 where things were not so good in Hong Kong,

259
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,880
 when Hong Kong was still making small steps

260
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,880
 into becoming this big city that it is right now.

261
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,880
 But these Baby Boomers have something very interesting,

262
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,880
 is that in this kind of maybe poorer beginning,

263
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
 they have learned to get it done.

264
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
 They are called the Get It Done Generation.

265
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
 They work hard.

266
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,880
 The mantra of this generation is survival and community.

267
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
 Things were tough, so it's all about surviving.

268
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
 It's all about function.

269
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,880
 It's all about efficiency.

270
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
 And it's all about community, sticking together.

271
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,880
 So they would trust leadership.

272
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,880
 They would trust authority.

273
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,880
 They would put their trust in establishments.

274
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
 So that's the Baby Boomers.

275
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,880
 And then from the Baby Boomers, you move into what they call the Gen X.

276
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,880
 And this is actually only a very small decade.

277
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,880
 It fits snugly in between the Baby Boomers and the Millennials.

278
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,880
 And these guys have started to learn to become a bit more independent.

279
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,880
 They're a bit more ambitious

280
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 because their parents have maybe paved the way for them.

281
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 And then you reach this big group, which is the Millennials,

282
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,880
 born in the '70s all the way up to the '90s.

283
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,880
 And this group are very different from the Baby Boomers.

284
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,880
 If the Baby Boomers were about survival and community,

285
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,880
 the Millennials are about authenticity and vulnerability.

286
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,880
 They're about finding their own identity, their own calling.

287
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,880
 It's a lot more about feeling.

288
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,880
 It's a lot more about their own personal ambitions.

289
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,880
 They don't trust establishments as much.

290
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,880
 They don't trust institutions.

291
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,880
 Their trust in leadership is not the same as the Baby Boomers.

292
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
 And their language is different.

293
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 If the Baby Boomers were more about honouring and respecting,

294
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,880
 the heart's cry of a Millennial is to be listened to and to be loved.

295
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,880
 And so even between these few generations, you see there are differences.

296
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,880
 And then you go further now into Gen Z,

297
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,880
 and the next one's called Alpha, which is the last decade.

298
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,880
 And these children are born into a society where technology is at their fingertips.

299
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,880
 They are used to talking more to Alexa than to their friends.

300
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,880
 They are used to using smartphones and smart devices.

301
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,880
 And they are in a completely different generation as well.

302
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
 So the question is this.

303
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,880
 How does a church do cross-generational work

304
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,880
 in a way that is able to kind of serve all the different generations?

305
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,880
 It is not an easy task, and I'm not going to be able to give you the answer,

306
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,880
 even within this sermon.

307
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,880
 But as I look through Scripture, as I look through the Word of God,

308
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,880
 there are some principles that I've found that are so key,

309
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,880
 so key for the body of Christ to be remembering

310
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,880
 as we head into cross-generational work.

311
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,880
 And I want to share three of them with you today.

312
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,880
 The first one is this.

313
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
 Whilst we're doing cross-generational work,

314
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,880
 the first thing we have to remember is that the church exists for all generations.

315
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,880
 There's a quote that I really love, and it says this.

316
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,880
 "There is a human tendency for each generation

317
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,880
 to believe and act as though the church exists for them."

318
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,880
 There is a human tendency for each generation to buy into the idea

319
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,880
 that the church was built for them, so everything is about them.

320
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,880
 The worship is tailored to their musical preferences.

321
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,880
 The sermons are preached in a style that is good for them.

322
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
 And when it's not, they get upset.

323
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,880
 The first key to doing cross-generational ministry is to remind everyone

324
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,880
 that we are all part of this generation.

325
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
 The people that are on this planet right now,

326
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
 the people that are in our churches right now,

327
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
 are all part of this generation,

328
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,880
 and we are all different parts of the body of Christ.

329
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,880
 1 Corinthians 12 talks about this, that there are different parts to the body,

330
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,880
 and I believe that is the same for the different generations.

331
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,880
 The diversity there is what makes it beautiful.

332
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,880
 Maybe someone in a generation who really values honour and respect and authority

333
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,880
 has so much good to bring to a church community,

334
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:19,880
 just as much as someone who maybe values more ambition and individuality and creativity.

335
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,880
 We all bring different parts to the body of Christ.

336
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,880
 We need to remember that all generations are part of this.

337
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,880
 You see, the problem is if you just focus on one generation,

338
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
 there's two real dangers that happen.

339
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,880
 One is the generation that you're targeting ends up thinking that this is all about them.

340
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,880
 And the other is the generations that you're not targeting feel neglected, feel left out.

341
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,880
 But if the church, imagine a church where people of all ages

342
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,880
 embrace the mission to serve each other, regardless of age,

343
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,880
 bringing what they have, their experiences, their upbringing, their personalities,

344
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:03,880
 bringing it into the body of Christ and allowing God to create this masterpiece, this mosaic,

345
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,880
 that includes all the different generations, that is the first key.

346
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,880
 We are all in this together.

347
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,880
 There is no next generation and previous generation.

348
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,880
 We are all this generation. That's number one.

349
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,880
 Number two is this.

350
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,880
 In that diversity, unity is only achieved through humility.

351
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
 Humility is the key.

352
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,880
 Now, what does that look like?

353
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,880
 Because when we have so many people from so many different ages,

354
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,880
 the diversity is incredible.

355
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,880
 The only way we can get everyone together and to stay together is if everyone remains humble,

356
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,880
 if everyone is open to the other's differences, to the other's preferences.

357
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,880
 Philippians 2 talks about this.

358
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,880
 Paul says, "If you have any encouragement in Christ,

359
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,880
 if there's any participation in the Spirit, be of the same mind, the same love, be of one accord.

360
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,880
 Consider others more significant than yourselves. Put their interests first."

361
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
 What does this look like?

362
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,880
 It looks like someone from one generation going to another saying,

363
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,880
 "Hey, this isn't really my musical style, but I know it's your jam,

364
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,880
 and I'm willing to go with it, and I'm willing to follow it because I love you.

365
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,880
 Because I love you, I want to put your interests above mine."

366
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,880
 And then it's the other person saying, "Look, I don't like this kind of style of preaching,

367
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,880
 but I know that it speaks to you.

368
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,880
 I'm willing to accommodate this and have this within our church

369
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,880
 because I want to build up the body of Christ as one."

370
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
 It's humility.

371
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,880
 You see, if we want true unity, there has to be diversity.

372
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
 Pastor John has said time and time again,

373
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,880
 if we are just all the same people just gathering together,

374
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,880
 that's not really unity, that's uniformity.

375
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
 That's what he said.

376
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,880
 If we want true unity, it's different people coming from different generations

377
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,880
 with different preferences all getting together.

378
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,880
 And the only way it works is humility.

379
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,880
 It's someone looking across the aisle and saying,

380
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,880
 "You are worth it. I love you just as I love myself,

381
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,880
 and I'm willing to put you above me."

382
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,880
 That is the key here, and that ties in with the first one.

383
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,880
 It requires all generations to be humble.

384
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,880
 It requires the people who are yearning and desiring to be listened to and loved.

385
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,880
 So also recognize that there are people here who actually,

386
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,880
 their way of expressing love is through honor and respect and provision,

387
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
 and it just looks different.

388
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,880
 It's being aware of the problem so we can find the solution together.

389
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,880
 We obtain unity despite diversity through humility.

390
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,880
 The final one is this, and this is where I want to dive a little bit

391
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,880
 into the scripture as we talk about this.

392
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,880
 If we are to really want to do cross-generational work,

393
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,880
 the key thing here in this final point is this.

394
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,880
 We must invest and empower young leaders.

395
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
 We must.

396
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
 You see, there's this tendency in our culture here,

397
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,880
 which is a very autocratic, hierarchical culture

398
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,880
 where you have to earn the right to be heard

399
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,880
 and you have to essentially do your time before you become a leader.

400
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,880
 But the problem is if we want to do cross-generational work,

401
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,880
 we need to pick out some of the young leaders,

402
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,880
 the young promising leaders now, and invest in them and empower them

403
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,880
 and also to take a risk on them.

404
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,880
 We've all been there where we're trying to teach someone younger than us something

405
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,880
 and they're just not doing it as well as we can,

406
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,880
 so we end up doing it for them and we don't let them do it.

407
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,880
 But then they don't learn, and by the time they do learn, it's too late.

408
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,880
 They're disillusioned, they're frustrated, their gift has gone to waste.

409
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,880
 If we are to do effective cross-generational work,

410
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,880
 we have to identify, invest, and empower these young leaders now.

411
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,880
 And a great example of this is in scripture.

412
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,880
 It's in the man Timothy.

413
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,880
 See, Timothy, we all hear about, because maybe the most famous passage

414
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,880
 is the one that Paul writes to Timothy as a mentor writing to a mentee

415
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,880
 and saying, you know, 1 Timothy 4.12,

416
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,880
 "Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young."

417
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
 Set an example.

418
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,880
 And so we know that Timothy was a church leader who was relatively young,

419
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
 maybe in his 30s when he was leading a church,

420
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,880
 when Paul was writing to him about this.

421
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,880
 But if you rewind even further, if you rewind the story

422
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:24,880
 all the way back to the time where Paul first meets Timothy,

423
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,880
 I find some really interesting things that happen.

424
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,880
 In Acts 16, Paul goes on his missionary journey.

425
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,880
 He goes to Derbe and he goes to Lystra.

426
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,880
 And when he reaches there, he meets this young man called Timothy,

427
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:40,880
 who was likely just a teenager at the time.

428
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,880
 Timothy was extremely interesting.

429
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,880
 He was the first second-generation Christian.

430
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
 He was also bicultural.

431
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
 His mother, Eunice, was a Jew.

432
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
 His father was a Greek.

433
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,880
 And what happens in those first few verses in Acts 16 is we see Paul

434
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,880
 meeting this young man, this young teenager, this boy, Timothy.

435
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
 And Timothy had a good reputation.

436
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,880
 That's what it says in the Scripture there, that he was of good repute.

437
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
 He was a "guide."

438
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,880
 He was going to the church and he was probably top of his Sunday school class,

439
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,880
 doing well, but he was still a young man nonetheless.

440
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,880
 And then you have this apostle Paul coming in from a different place,

441
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,880
 reaching this little town, and from there he identifies this young man, Timothy.

442
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
 And then what does he do?

443
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,880
 He invests in him and he empowers him.

444
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,880
 He looks at this young man and says, "You come with me to minister together.

445
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,880
 You may be young in age, but I see something in you,

446
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,880
 and I want to take you with me.

447
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,880
 I want to take you under my wing and do this."

448
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
 That is what we need to do.

449
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,880
 We need to look at some of the young people and we need to say,

450
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
 "How can I invest in you?

451
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,880
 How can I pave the way for you so that you can become an effective minister

452
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:01,880
 and a devoted believer and follower of Christ in your own right?

453
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,880
 How can I let you start making decisions?

454
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,880
 How can I let you make mistakes yourself so you can learn from them?"

455
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,880
 It's willing to give up this fear of making mistakes,

456
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,880
 fear of looking bad, and fear of shame, but this is saying,

457
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,880
 "Hey, the next generation, the young people are important,

458
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,880
 and they'll be wanting to serve across the board.

459
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,880
 We need leaders across the board."

460
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
 And you see, with Timothy, it's interesting.

461
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,880
 It wasn't only the Apostle Paul and outside coming in to invest in him.

462
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,880
 It was also his mother and grandmother in 2 Timothy 1 and 5.

463
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,880
 We see that.

464
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,880
 Paul's writing to Timothy much later on now, and he's saying,

465
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,880
 "I saw a sincere faith in you, Timothy,

466
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,880
 that I first saw in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice."

467
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,880
 So what we see here is that not only are church brothers and sisters,

468
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:57,880
 church leaders such as Paul, willing to invest in someone young like Timothy,

469
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,880
 but also it starts within the home that Timothy himself was invested to

470
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,880
 by his grandmother and his mother.

471
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,880
 "It takes a village to raise a child" is the quote that we often hear.

472
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,880
 "It takes a whole church community to raise a leader."

473
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,880
 We need to be committed to investing and empowering the young people

474
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,880
 because they are the ones that are going to be the future of this city as well.

475
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,880
 But they won't survive, and they won't do well if those of us who are more experienced,

476
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,880
 more mature, more wise, more weathered,

477
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,880
 they won't do well unless this group of people chooses to invest

478
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,880
 and pour into these people and to give them opportunities and to give them chances.

479
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,880
 That is how we start doing cross-generational work.

480
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,880
 And I truly believe that we are entering into a new norm in this city.

481
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,880
 What we knew before may be changed when we come out of this pandemic,

482
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,880
 and there are going to be new ways, and God we know is moving in this city

483
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,880
 in new and mysterious and beautiful ways.

484
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,880
 My prayer, our prayer as a staff here, is that our church, the body of Christ,

485
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,880
 will be mobilised and will be committed to serving the people of all generations

486
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,880
 and being willing to follow God's guidance and his spirit in doing this.

487
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,880
 So my prayer to you, brother and sister, is as you receive this word,

488
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,880
 start thinking and start praying to God.

489
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,880
 Who are the people that God has placed in your life, whether younger or older?

490
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,880
 Who are the people that he has placed in your life who you can start reaching out to,

491
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,880
 who you can start investing into?

492
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,880
 And remember, some of these people will make you feel uncomfortable.

493
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,880
 Why? Because they're different. They're younger, they're older,

494
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,880
 they have different backgrounds, they're from a different class maybe.

495
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,880
 But the goal here is if we're to do cross-generational ministry,

496
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,880
 we have to be willing to be comfortably uncomfortable,

497
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,880
 because that is what Christ did for us, that he would leave heaven's throne,

498
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,880
 remove the comfort from himself, come into a world, become completely uncomfortable,

499
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,880
 and then to subject himself to death on a cross, to lay his life down for us,

500
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,880
 and to die, but then to rise again so that we can identify with his death and his resurrection.

501
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,880
 And if we truly believe that, and if we truly do that,

502
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:43,880
 we will then be on to a great start in how we lay our lives down for those in our church, regardless of age.

503
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,880
 Bless you.

504
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,880
 James, that was an incredible message.

505
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,880
 After a message like that and a subject like Linking the Generations,

506
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,880
 there's only one song we could go out with.

507
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,880
 This was a song that was written just about eight weeks ago,

508
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,880
