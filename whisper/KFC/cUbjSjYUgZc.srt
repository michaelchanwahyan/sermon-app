1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,440
 It's a joy to be able to bring you the Word today.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,040
 And we are so missing everyone, just being able to gather.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,640
 And we are really, really close now.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,480
 We're praying that in these coming weeks,

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,600
 we will have a chance to just be together again.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,800
 Today, I want to be talking about how we cross generations.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,360
 You know, coming to Hong Kong,

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,240
 one of the biggest inspirations for me

10
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,560
 has been meeting Pastor John and Pastor Peter,

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,760
 who have this vision to embrace this next generation.

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,640
 And this last year,

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,200
 the next generation have had a torch shone on them,

14
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,720
 because the next generation are showing some of the feelings

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,480
 or the frustrations they have about their future.

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,440
 And we know that the next generation

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,800
 that is coming up in Hong Kong

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,400
 is in deep need of the gospel,

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,200
 in deep need of hope

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,320
 and being told that everything is going to be okay.

21
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,920
 And so for us as a church,

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,280
 the question really remains is,

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,320
 how do we serve this next generation?

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,240
 How do we cross generations in our ministries?

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,800
 And in my work with Young Life now,

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,960
 that is what it's all about.

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,240
 How do we introduce the next generation to Jesus Christ?

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,360
 And then for a parachurch,

29
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,680
 how do we work together with the church,

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,680
 all being a part of the body of Christ

31
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,680
 in solving this problem?

32
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,640
 For me, as we talk about how to cross generations,

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,240
 the first thing we need to think about is,

34
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,960
 before we even get to the solution,

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,560
 we first need to understand the problem.

36
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,480
 And the problem is this,

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,360
 there is difficulty with doing next generation work,

38
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,520
 because there is such a thing as a generation gap.

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,760
 The generation gap is there

40
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,760
 is because generations are simply different.

41
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,920
 And they've always been different

42
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,960
 since the beginning of mankind,

43
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,000
 but they've been even more amplified now

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,320
 because of technology, because of globalization.

45
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,040
 So what we have now are generations are becoming so divided

46
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,560
 in their way of thinking and their way of acting.

47
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
 For example, we have a generation called the baby boomers

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,600
 who are on the whole born in between the 40s and the 60s.

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,160
 A lot of the current society's leaders

50
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,560
 are part of this generation.

51
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,080
 And this generation, the baby boomers,

52
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,320
 they come from a time where things

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,760
 were not so good in Hong Kong,

54
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,280
 when Hong Kong was still making small steps

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,360
 into becoming this big city that it is right now.

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,400
 But these baby boomers have something very interesting

57
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,080
 is that in this kind of maybe poorer beginning,

58
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,040
 they have learned to get it done.

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,480
 They are called the get it done generation.

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,560
 They work hard.

61
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,040
 The mantra of this generation is survival and community.

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,680
 Things were tough, so it's all about surviving.

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,600
 It's all about function.

64
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,160
 It's all about efficiency.

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,840
 And it's all about community, sticking together.

66
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,200
 So they would trust leadership.

67
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,600
 They would trust authority.

68
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,360
 They would put their trust in establishments.

69
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,760
 So that's the baby boomers.

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,000
 And then from the baby boomers,

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,520
 you move into what they call the Gen X.

72
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,240
 And this is actually only a very small decade.

73
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,600
 It fits snugly in between the baby boomers

74
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,440
 and the millennials.

75
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,080
 And these guys have started to learn

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,000
 to become a bit more independent.

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,480
 They're a bit more ambitious

78
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,240
 because their parents have maybe paved the way for them.

79
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,720
 And then you reach this big group,

80
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,800
 which is the millennials,

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
 born in the '70s all the way up to the '90s.

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,120
 And this group are very different from the baby boomers.

83
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,680
 If the baby boomers were about survival and community,

84
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,040
 the millennials are about authenticity and vulnerability.

85
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,880
 They're about finding their own identity,

86
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,120
 their own calling.

87
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,200
 It's a lot more about feeling.

88
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,480
 It's a lot more about their own personal ambitions.

89
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,120
 They don't trust establishments as much.

90
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,720
 They don't trust institutions.

91
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,160
 Their trust in leadership is not the same

92
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,000
 as the baby boomers.

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,520
 And their language is different.

94
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,880
 If the baby boomers were more about honoring and respecting,

95
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,720
 the heart's cry of a millennial

96
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,240
 is to be listened to and to be loved.

97
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,680
 And so even between these few generations,

98
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,440
 you see there are differences.

99
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,360
 And then you go further now into Gen Z,

100
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,960
 and the next one's called Alpha,

101
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,000
 which is the last decade.

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,200
 And these children are born into a society

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,160
 where technology is at their fingertips.

104
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,520
 They are used to talking more to Alexa

105
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,840
 than to their friends.

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,480
 They are used to using smartphones and smart devices,

107
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,040
 and they are in a completely different generation as well.

108
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,640
 So the question is this.

109
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,000
 How does a church do cross-generational work

110
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,080
 in a way that is able to kind of serve

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,960
 all the different generations?

112
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,920
 It is not an easy task,

113
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,880
 and I'm not gonna be able to give you the answer

114
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,240
 even within this sermon.

115
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,480
 But as I look through scripture,

116
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,600
 as I look through the word of God,

117
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,840
 there are some principles that I've found

118
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,560
 that are so key, so key,

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,040
 for the body of Christ to be remembering

120
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,040
 as we head into generation, cross-generational work.

121
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,640
 And I'll share three of them with you today.

122
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,200
 The first one is this.

123
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,400
 Whilst we're doing cross-generational work,

124
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,000
 the first thing we have to remember

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,280
 is that the church exists for all generations.

126
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
 There's a quote that I really love, and it says this.

127
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,080
 There is a human tendency for each generation

128
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,600
 to believe and act as though the church exists for them.

129
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,040
 There is a human tendency for each generation

130
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,400
 to buy into the idea that the church was built for them,

131
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,280
 so everything is about them.

132
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,480
 The worship is tailored to their musical preferences.

133
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,080
 The sermons are preached in a style that is good for them.

134
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,720
 And when it's not, they get upset.

135
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,280
 The first key to doing cross-generational ministry

136
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,080
 is to remind everyone that we are all

137
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,760
 part of this generation.

138
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,400
 The people that are on this planet right now,

139
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,680
 the people that are in our churches right now

140
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,880
 are all part of this generation,

141
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,600
 and we are all different parts of the body of Christ.

142
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,480
 1 Corinthians 12 talks about this,

143
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,000
 that there are different parts to the body,

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,160
 and I believe that is the same

145
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,760
 for the different generations.

146
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,800
 The diversity there is what makes it beautiful.

147
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,920
 Maybe someone in a generation who really values honour

148
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,920
 and respect and authority has so much good to bring

149
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,840
 to a church community, just as much as someone

150
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,000
 who maybe values more ambition

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,360
 and individuality and creativity.

152
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,080
 We all bring different parts to the body of Christ.

153
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,720
 We need to remember that all generations are part of this.

154
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,720
 You see, the problem is if you just focus on one generation,

155
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,920
 there's two real dangers that happen.

156
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,520
 One is the generation that you're targeting

157
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,320
 ends up thinking that this is all about them,

158
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,440
 and the other is the generations that you're not targeting

159
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,040
 feel neglected, feel left out.

160
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,880
 But if the church, imagine a church where people

161
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,880
 of all ages embrace the mission to serve each other

162
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,040
 regardless of age, bringing what they have,

163
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,440
 their experiences, their upbringing, their personalities,

164
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,400
 bringing it into the body of Christ,

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,240
 and allowing God to create this masterpiece, this mosaic,

166
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,720
 that includes all the different generations,

167
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,120
 that is the first key.

168
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,600
 We are all in this together.

169
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,960
 There is no next generation and previous generation.

170
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,800
 We are all this generation.

171
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
 That's number one.

172
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,760
 Number two is this.

173
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,760
 In that diversity, unity is only achieved through humility.

174
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,400
 Humility is the key.

175
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,320
 Now, what does that look like?

176
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,400
 Because when we have so many people

177
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,080
 from so many different ages,

178
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,160
 their diversity is incredible.

179
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,840
 The only way we can get everyone together

180
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,280
 and to stay together is if everyone remains humble,

181
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,360
 if everyone is open to the other's differences,

182
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,600
 to the other's preferences.

183
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,360
 Philippians 2 talks about this.

184
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,480
 Paul says, "If you have any encouragement in Christ,

185
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,400
 "if there's any participation in the Spirit,

186
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,520
 "be of the same mind, the same love, be of one accord.

187
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,840
 "Consider others more significant than yourselves.

188
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,440
 "Put their interests first."

189
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,320
 What does this look like?

190
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,920
 It looks like someone from one generation

191
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,760
 going to another saying,

192
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,080
 "Hey, this isn't really my musical style,

193
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,560
 "but I know it's your jam,

194
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,760
 "and I'm willing to go with it,

195
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,520
 "and I'm willing to follow it because I love you.

196
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,320
 "Because I love you, I want to put your interests above mine."

197
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,640
 And then it's the other person saying,

198
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,960
 "Look, I don't like this kind of style of preaching,

199
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,760
 "but I know that it speaks to you.

200
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,200
 "I'm willing to accommodate this

201
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,840
 "and have this within our church

202
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,520
 "because I want to build up the body of Christ as one."

203
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,920
 It's humility.

204
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,920
 You see, if we want true unity, there has to be diversity.

205
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,680
 Now, Pastor John has said time and time again,

206
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,920
 if we are just all the same people just gathering together,

207
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,960
 that's not really unity, that's uniformity, all right?

208
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,080
 That's what he said.

209
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,480
 If we want true unity, it's different people

210
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,000
 coming from different generations

211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,600
 with different preferences all getting together.

212
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,440
 And the only way it works is humility.

213
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,000
 It's someone looking across the aisle and saying,

214
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,840
 "You are worth it.

215
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,560
 "I love you just as I love myself,

216
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:39,280
 "and I'm willing to put you above me."

217
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,680
 That is the key, and that ties in with the first one.

218
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,280
 It requires all generations to be humble.

219
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,840
 It requires the people who are yearning and desiring

220
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,080
 to be listened to and loved.

221
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
 So also recognize that there are people here

222
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,080
 who actually, their way of expressing love

223
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,000
 is through honor and respect and provision.

224
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,920
 And it just looks different.

225
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,760
 It's being aware of the problem

226
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,000
 so we can find the solution together.

227
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 We obtain unity despite diversity through humility.

228
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,800
 And the final one is this,

229
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,520
 and this is where I wanna dive a little bit

230
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,680
 into the scripture as we talk about this.

231
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,760
 If we are to really want to do cross-generational work,

232
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,640
 the key thing here, and this final point is this,

233
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,640
 we must, we must invest and empower young leaders.

234
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
 We must.

235
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,520
 You see, there's this tendency in our culture here

236
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,280
 which is a very autocratic, hierarchical culture

237
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,320
 where you have to earn the right to be heard

238
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,240
 and you have to essentially do your time

239
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,440
 before you become a leader.

240
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,480
 But the problem is if we want to do cross-generational work,

241
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,520
 we need to pick out some of the young leaders,

242
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,120
 the young promising leaders now,

243
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,320
 and invest in them and empower them,

244
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,120
 and also to take a risk on them.

245
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,280
 We've all been there where we're trying

246
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,440
 to teach someone younger than us something,

247
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,520
 and they're just not doing it as well as we can,

248
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,720
 so we end up doing it for them

249
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,000
 and we don't let them do it.

250
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,360
 But then they don't learn.

251
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,440
 And by the time they do learn, it's too late.

252
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,320
 They're disillusioned, they're frustrated,

253
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,160
 their gift has gone to waste.

254
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,520
 If we are to do effective cross-generational work,

255
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,160
 we have to identify, invest,

256
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,120
 and empower these young leaders now.

257
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,880
 And a great example of this is in scripture.

258
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,240
 It's in the man Timothy.

259
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,800
 See, Timothy, we all hear about,

260
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,560
 as maybe the most famous passage,

261
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,320
 is the one that Paul writes to Timothy

262
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,520
 as a mentor writing to a mentee,

263
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,440
 and saying, you know, 1 Timothy 4, 12,

264
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,520
 don't let anyone look down on you,

265
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,000
 because you are young.

266
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,440
 Set an example.

267
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,920
 And so we know that Timothy was a church leader

268
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,440
 who was relatively young,

269
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,600
 maybe in his 30s when he was leading a church

270
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,240
 when Paul was writing to him about this.

271
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,960
 But if you rewind even further,

272
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,520
 if you rewind the story all to the time

273
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,480
 where Paul first meets Timothy,

274
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,040
 I find some really interesting things that happen.

275
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,680
 In Acts 16, Paul goes on his missionary journey.

276
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
 He goes to Derbe, and he goes to Lystra.

277
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,760
 And when he reaches there,

278
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,880
 he meets this young man called Timothy,

279
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,560
 who was likely just a teenager at the time.

280
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,440
 Timothy was extremely interesting.

281
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,000
 He was the first second-generation Christian.

282
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,200
 He was also bicultural.

283
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,640
 His mother, Eunice, was a Jew.

284
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,600
 His father was a Greek.

285
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,560
 And what happens in those first few verses in Acts 16

286
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,760
 is we see Paul meeting this young man,

287
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,360
 this young teenager, this boy, Timothy.

288
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,560
 And Timothy had a good reputation.

289
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,040
 That's what it says in the scripture there,

290
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,800
 that he was of good repute.

291
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,360
 He was a "guai zhen."

292
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,600
 He was going to the church,

293
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,160
 and he was probably top of his Sunday school class,

294
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,160
 doing well, but he was still a young man nonetheless.

295
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,520
 And then you have this apostle Paul coming in

296
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,480
 from a different place, reaching this little town.

297
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
 And from there, he identifies this young man, Timothy.

298
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,960
 And then what does he do?

299
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,760
 He invests in him, and he empowers him.

300
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,520
 He looks at this young man and says,

301
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,440
 "You come with me to minister together.

302
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,000
 "You may be young in age, but I see something in you,

303
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,240
 "and I want to take you with me.

304
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,560
 "I want to take you under my wing and do this."

305
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,440
 That is what we need to do.

306
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,560
 We need to look at some of the young people,

307
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,480
 and we need to say, "How can I invest in you?

308
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,840
 "How can I pave the way for you

309
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,240
 "so that you can become an effective minister,

310
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,400
 "a devoted believer and follower of Christ in your own right?

311
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,280
 "How can I let you start making decisions?

312
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,120
 "How can I let you make mistakes yourself

313
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,880
 "so you can learn from them?"

314
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,480
 It's willing to give up this fear of making mistakes,

315
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,080
 a fear of looking bad, and fear of shame,

316
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,240
 but this is saying, "Hey, the next generation,

317
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,880
 "the young people are important,

318
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,480
 "and if we're wanting to serve across the board,

319
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,520
 "we need leaders across the board."

320
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,960
 And you see, with Timothy, it's interesting.

321
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,040
 It wasn't only the Apostle Paul and outside

322
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,680
 coming in to invest in him.

323
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,320
 It was also his mother and grandmother.

324
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,560
 In 2 Timothy 1.5, we see that.

325
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,600
 Paul's writing to Timothy much later on now,

326
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,400
 and he's saying, "I saw a sincere faith in you, Timothy,

327
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,320
 "that I first saw in your grandmother Lois

328
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,120
 "and your mother Eunice."

329
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,120
 So what we see here is that not only are church brothers

330
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,240
 and sisters, church leaders such as Paul,

331
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,120
 willing to invest in someone young like Timothy,

332
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,240
 but also it starts within the home

333
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,720
 that Timothy himself was invested to

334
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,400
 by his grandmother and his mother.

335
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:40,120
 It takes a village to raise a child

336
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,720
 is the quote that we often hear.

337
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,040
 It takes a whole church community to raise a leader.

338
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,960
 We need to be committed to investing

339
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,200
 and empowering the young people

340
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,720
 because they are the ones that are gonna be the future

341
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,000
 of this city as well, but they won't survive

342
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,160
 and they won't do well if those of us

343
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,880
 who are more experienced, more mature,

344
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,120
 more wise, more weathered, they won't do well

345
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,880
 unless this group of people chooses to invest

346
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,480
 and pour into these people and to give them opportunities

347
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,000
 and to give them chances.

348
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,920
 That is how we start doing cross-generational work.

349
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,360
 And I truly believe that we are entering

350
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,560
 into a new norm in this city.

351
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,400
 What we knew before may be changed

352
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,160
 when we come out of this pandemic

353
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,520
 and there are gonna be new ways

354
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,120
 and God we know is moving in this city

355
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,480
 in new and mysterious and beautiful ways.

356
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,760
 My prayer, our prayer as a staff here

357
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,640
 is that our church, the body of Christ

358
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,960
 will be mobilised and will be committed

359
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,240
 to serving the people of all generations

360
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,760
 and being willing to follow God's guidance

361
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,280
 and his spirit in doing this.

362
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,280
 So my prayer to you, brother and sister,

363
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,920
 is as you receive this word, start thinking

364
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,400
 and start praying to God.

365
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,360
 Who are the people that God has placed in your life,

366
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,760
 whether younger or older?

367
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,600
 Who are the people that he has placed in your life

368
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
 who you can start reaching out to,

369
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
 who you can start investing into?

370
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,920
 And remember, some of these people

371
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,360
 will make you feel uncomfortable.

372
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,200
 Why?

373
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,160
 Because they're different.

374
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,800
 They're younger, they're older,

375
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,000
 they have different backgrounds,

376
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,840
 they're from a different class maybe.

377
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,640
 But the goal here is if we're to do

378
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,960
 cross-generational ministry,

379
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,120
 we have to be willing to be comfortably uncomfortable

380
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,440
 because that is what Christ did for us,

381
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,320
 that he would leave heaven's throne,

382
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,440
 remove the comfort from himself,

383
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,280
 come into a world, become completely uncomfortable,

384
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,400
 and then to subject himself to death on the cross,

385
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,120
 to lay his life down for us and to die,

386
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,040
 but then to rise again so that we can identify

387
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,720
 with his death and his resurrection.

388
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,400
 And if we truly believe that and if we truly do that,

389
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,080
 we will then be onto a great start

390
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,760
 in how we lay our lives down for those in our church,

391
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,520
 regardless of age.
