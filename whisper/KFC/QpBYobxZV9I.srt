1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 So good evening everyone.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,200
 Tonight we're going to start on a new series on the book of Ecclesiastes.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,460
 Now the topic that we'll be discussing today is, is life worth living?

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,400
 Now as you all or some of you might know, I am pregnant.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,640
 I'll just show my tummy.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,640
 This is not eating too much potato chips for sure.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,760
 And so Philemon and I are expecting to have a baby in December and we're extremely excited

8
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
 about it.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,520
 For those of you who want to ask, do we know if it's a boy or a girl yet?

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:51,440
 The answer is not yet, but we will be in about 10 days time when we do another round of scanning.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,000
 Now I know that Pastor John really wanted me to do this, which is to hold my tummy and

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,080
 then ask, is life worth living?

13
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,600
 I mean he did mention that he can use his own belly, but I think it might mean something

14
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,440
 else if he did that.

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,780
 So let's stick with me I think.

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,560
 So as a new life begins from a baby's first breath to the last one, there's a lot of things

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,040
 that happen, right?

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,760
 And in the Hong Kong context, what does that mean?

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,320
 It means that the parents will have to start looking for a hospital to give birth.

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,920
 And then next thing you know, the child is born and he or she learns to walk and talk

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,400
 and learns to be cute.

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,880
 Maybe that part they don't have to learn.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,960
 They're naturally born, right?

24
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,800
 And then of course you have to go through trying to line up for an interview to get

25
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,440
 into what?

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,560
 Kindergarten, okay?

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,000
 And then go through primary school trying to do all the exams so that you can get into

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,920
 good secondary school.

29
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
 And then what?

30
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,040
 You might start dating if your parents allow you.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 And if they don't, well you just kind of hide it from them and you still do it anyways,

32
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
 right?

33
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,720
 And then you go through college and then you might find a job that you like or it was encouraged

34
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,520
 by your parents to do it, right?

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:23,000
 And so eventually you might get yourself a house, a mortgage, and some of you decides

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,680
 to get married or some of you might not.

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,960
 And that's kind of what we see, right?

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,600
 And then they might have kids and then we see that all over again.

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,200
 And then that person may or may not get sick and then eventually what happens?

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,140
 They die.

41
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,280
 And that is the story of life.

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,120
 But there's also another story that we'll also see, right?

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,880
 There are people, for example, that are orphans to begin with or they might be born with a

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:03:00,280
 disability or they might actually develop a severe disease in which their lives would

45
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,300
 never be the same for them and also their families.

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,400
 It's very difficult, right?

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,960
 And actually some other ones, they might start to be involved with drugs or involved with

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,480
 the wrong people that lead them to commit crimes.

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,160
 And yet there are still others who might commit suicide because of a mental illness or things

50
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,160
 that are happening in their lives.

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:35,920
 So what we see is that rather it is the circle of life or unintended mishaps in life.

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,280
 It begs the question, is life worth living?

53
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,760
 And so first off, what we're going to do today is that we are going to unfold Ecclesiastes

54
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,840
 little bit at a time.

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,840
 And then so today I want to first give you some background about the book of Ecclesiastes.

56
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,920
 Now it is a piece of wisdom literature.

57
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
 So it has a lot of wisdom.

58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,600
 That's what it means.

59
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,440
 And then it's also written in a form of a poetry, which is very common in that time

60
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,280
 of King Solomon and also in the near East countries.

61
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,960
 Now it's a very different books than all the other books, right?

62
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,640
 Because what we see is before that there is the story of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob about the

63
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,640
 Israelites and all of a sudden there's the book of Ecclesiastes.

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:36,640
 And it's really a story that's kind of observes life and then draws some conclusions.

65
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:43,640
 So Ecclesiastes offer a rather dark and sometimes even depressing worldview.

66
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:51,520
 Now fertility and emptiness seems to overwhelm what is joy and success, right?

67
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,040
 And life is unfair.

68
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,440
 Work is pointless.

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,560
 Nature fails to satisfy.

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:07,480
 Good living and wise thinking seems to be futile because you, us, we're all going to

71
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,400
 die anyways.

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,160
 And it suggests that only fearing God and preparing for judgment matters.

73
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,360
 So we're going to unpack that throughout the next 11 weeks.

74
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,200
 And these are the topics that we'll be going through.

75
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,160
 So tonight is, is life worth living?

76
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:32,520
 And we're going to look at living in circles, disgusted with life, time and toil.

77
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,200
 Life just isn't fair.

78
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,680
 Stop thief.

79
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,400
 Is life a dead end street?

80
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,760
 How to be better off?

81
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,080
 What about the wicked?

82
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,080
 Meaning so small here, meeting your last enemy.

83
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,800
 A little folly is dangerous.

84
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,900
 What is life all about?

85
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,720
 So we're just going to unpack that.

86
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,920
 But today really would be answering the question, is life worth living?

87
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,320
 Now in the very first verse of this chapter, we see the words of the preacher, the son

88
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,260
 of David, King of Jerusalem.

89
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,440
 So what we see is that the author right from the start introduces what he's about to say

90
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,640
 and is from this preacher.

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,040
 Now the word preacher in Hebrew is kohelet.

92
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,840
 It stems from this verb that means an assembly of people.

93
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,240
 And in this case is an assembly of people that would come together to learn and to listen.

94
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:38,680
 And the Greek is ecclesiaste, which is what we get from the English, the name of this

95
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,960
 book Ecclesiastes.

96
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,480
 And the Greek word is ecclesia, which is what we see in the New Testament, that means church.

97
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:56,440
 So it's a people of gathering to hear this wisdom preached by this preacher.

98
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,680
 Now so many would identify, do you know who the author is of this book?

99
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,640
 Solomon, yes.

100
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,960
 So many would actually identify the author to be Solomon because while it says that it

101
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,900
 is the son of David, right?

102
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,560
 And who would not be better than Solomon?

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,440
 But there are also other good reasons to believe that it might not be Solomon because it was

104
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
 never explicitly said.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,600
 I mean, son of David could be more than one and it can just be a way that the author introduces

106
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,940
 this preacher.

107
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:38,040
 And at the same time, Solomon refers to a number of, sorry, the author introduces himself

108
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,120
 as I the king more than once.

109
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,000
 But when he did that, it was in an era that was not quite in Solomon's time.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,440
 And also the Hebrew language that was used was actually not the time where Solomon was,

111
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,340
 but a bit later after that.

112
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:02,560
 So it suggests that it might not be Solomon, but it is debatable rather or not it is him.

113
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,840
 But one thing that is more widely accepted is that the person who's writing it, the author

114
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:16,200
 actually adopts the personality of King Solomon and his point of view.

115
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,580
 So it seems that there should be at least two roles, okay?

116
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:26,960
 There's one role of the author or the editor, and then there's the preacher who is examining

117
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,440
 the world and he's drawing some conclusion himself.

118
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:38,800
 But at the same time, the author or the editor is also observing what this preacher is saying

119
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,080
 and drawing his own conclusions.

120
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,680
 So we're sometimes going to see here two voices because of this.

121
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,400
 It might be the same person, but we don't know for sure.

122
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:58,340
 Now, so in verse three, the author says, "What does man gain by all the toil at which he

123
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,680
 toils under the sun?"

124
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,400
 Now this is a very good question.

125
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,160
 What does man gain through all the works under the sun?

126
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,880
 But it seems to not answer it right at this moment.

127
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,760
 But you notice, you know how sometimes we ask a question, it's almost like we've already

128
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,760
 given the answer, right?

129
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:24,720
 So and then it implicitly implies that actually no, there is no benefit of all the toils under

130
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
 the sun.

131
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,120
 Now when we talk about benefits or gain in this word, I want to highlight the word gain,

132
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
 okay?

133
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,400
 I mean, what do we think of?

134
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,800
 We think of jeckso, right?

135
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,680
 Jeckso, okay?

136
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,440
 And I think the people in Hong Kong are not foreign to it, okay?

137
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,960
 Is anybody who's here that doesn't want a good deal?

138
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,900
 We all want a good deal, right?

139
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:54,960
 So just a few days ago at 7/11, there was this great deal of their annual sale, 23%

140
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,560
 off, everything above $100, if you can read this.

141
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:05,800
 And so being the kind of wanting jeckso people, right, on our way home, Falima and I decided,

142
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,800
 you know what, maybe we'll pass by 7/11 just to have a look, see what kind of good deals

143
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,680
 we get, right?

144
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,320
 And so when we got off the bus, there were six people ahead of us.

145
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,240
 And surprisingly enough, they were all heading to the 7/11 for what?

146
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,440
 Jeckso, right?

147
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
 Yeah.

148
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,520
 And so recently we've been trying to fix up our air con as well at home.

149
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:34,920
 So I've been calling places after places, over 10 for sure, to get a quote.

150
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
 Why?

151
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,920
 Because I want to save a few hundred dollars, maybe over a thousand.

152
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,920
 So I mean, we're definitely not foreigners of this gain or jeckso, right?

153
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,120
 And I mean, that's why you choose your job anyways, hopefully.

154
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,880
 I mean, if there were two jobs that gave you an offer, which one do you choose?

155
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,160
 The one that gave you more benefit.

156
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,000
 If there were two people that you could be dating, which one would you choose?

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,440
 The one that probably encourages you and loves you more, right?

158
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,320
 Not money wise, come on.

159
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,240
 And then of course, we think about these things, don't we?

160
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,520
 I mean, who here's want to do all the work for nothing?

161
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,600
 Put up your hand, come on.

162
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,720
 We'll hire you right away.

163
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,620
 No one, right?

164
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:32,700
 So when we talk about gain, because this is what Ecclesiastes is saying, that what does

165
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,580
 man gain from all this toil?

166
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,420
 It's a good question.

167
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,480
 What do we benefit from?

168
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:59,040
 Now it actually in verse two, the author tells us why it is that there is no gain.

169
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,920
 I'm going back from verse three, back to verse two, because he says, "Vanity of vanities."

170
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,140
 The preacher says, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."

171
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,800
 Now the Hebrew word is actually hebel.

172
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,960
 It means that it's futile, lacking substance, profitless, and pointless.

173
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,960
 The reason it asks the next question, what is the gain, is because he's already seen

174
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,320
 that there is no gain.

175
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
 It's all vanity.

176
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,600
 And in its noun form, it means like vapor or wind.

177
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,320
 So I want you to all hold out your hand right now, either hand.

178
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,320
 Okay, now try to hold some air.

179
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
 Can you do that?

180
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,240
 Are you holding?

181
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
 This is hebel.

182
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,720
 Okay, you can put it down now.

183
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,440
 You don't have to do it all night long, unless you really want it.

184
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,440
 But this is hebel.

185
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,760
 So every time we talk about this fertility, where this nothingness or this emptiness,

186
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,640
 something that we can't grasp and is fleeting away, because even if you have tried, you

187
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,640
 can't.

188
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,400
 So a few days ago, Felima and I were watching the Grand Slam.

189
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,160
 It was the Wimbledon's finals.

190
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,800
 And we watched the women's final.

191
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,760
 It was Elena Rebikina against Anjabub.

192
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,800
 I can never really pronounce their name right.

193
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,760
 But what we see is it was the final, and they were in the third set, and eventually, of

194
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,840
 course, not of course, but Rebikina won.

195
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,160
 And so we were expecting all other champions, what did they do?

196
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,280
 They jump up and down, and some of them fall on their faces, and they're just like disbelief.

197
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,200
 Oh my gosh, I won this, right?

198
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,360
 That's what we were expecting.

199
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,160
 But interestingly, Rebikina did not respond like that.

200
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,360
 She was as if she just made it into the preliminary.

201
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,020
 She was like, "Okay, thank you."

202
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,040
 But even the commentators had to say, "Can someone please go down and tell her she just

203
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,840
 won the Wimbledon's final?"

204
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,280
 Okay, because it's like she's unaware of it.

205
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:18,360
 And I just thought to myself, maybe she has got ecclesiastics nailed.

206
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,480
 Maybe she's like, "It's all futile anyways.

207
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,480
 I mean, Wimbledon finals, whatever.

208
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,400
 Yeah, $2.5 million of something, I think.

209
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,960
 It's okay."

210
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,820
 What does that mean?

211
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,400
 Of course, eventually during an interview, she did say she was too nervous to respond.

212
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,560
 But what we actually see is that life is just temporal.

213
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,980
 This is one of the main themes in ecclesiastics.

214
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
 It's temporal.

215
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,360
 It's just going to go away.

216
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,920
 Rather you win this final or not, rather you achieve whatever status you want to have,

217
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,280
 however many kids you want, or gain however much you want.

218
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:10,520
 Whether you're the CEO or the street cleaner, it really doesn't matter the moment you die.

219
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,720
 And so this brings us to our first point, which is don't live for the temporal, but

220
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,920
 live for the eternal.

221
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,320
 Now if we already know from the beginning that, well, if everything's temporal and all

222
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:32,960
 our happiness or sadness is going to go away anyways, why make a big fuss out of it?

223
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,160
 Of course, well, some people go to the other extreme.

224
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
 Then you know what?

225
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,840
 Let's just all sit here and wait to die.

226
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,400
 Okay, that doesn't benefit us either, does it?

227
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,180
 So you see, either we work and toil under the sun, that doesn't benefit.

228
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,880
 No gain, no jacksoap.

229
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,440
 Or we sit there and we wait to die.

230
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,440
 There's no benefit in that either.

231
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:11,120
 But what we see in the Bible is Matthew 16, 26, it says, "What good will it be for a man

232
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,000
 if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?"

233
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,440
 So it's an obvious comparison that even with all the riches, all the gains that we will

234
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:34,360
 have in this world, but if we lose our soul, there is no benefit, no jacksoap, it's hebel.

235
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,280
 So instead we must live now, not for now then.

236
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,960
 We must live now for the future.

237
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,380
 Let me say that again.

238
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,320
 We must not live now for now.

239
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:56,520
 We must live now for the future.

240
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:03,240
 It means that if we live for the temporal life, for money, fame, or whatever we want,

241
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,880
 we won't gain anything.

242
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,640
 But if we live for the eternal, we will gain everything.

243
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,820
 That is our soul, our eternal life.

244
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:22,240
 And so we do know that from the rest of the Bible, that if we have accepted Jesus, if

245
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:30,360
 we have repented of our sins, and if we continue to faithfully follow him, then we will have

246
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:37,120
 our soul, our life, our eternal life, which is the most important thing.

247
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:45,440
 Now if we go back to see Ecclesiastes chapter one, verse three, we see that.

248
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,140
 Let's look clearly again at this question.

249
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,340
 I mean, I only got three verses to work with, so I'm going to look clearly into each one.

250
00:17:53,340 --> 00:18:00,100
 What does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the sun?

251
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,500
 You know, we actually see the preacher saying under the sun 29 times in this book.

252
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,780
 What do you think that signifies?

253
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,940
 It means that if our eyes, I mean, it doesn't mean that if we do it on a rainy day, then

254
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,500
 everything's different.

255
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:26,380
 It just means that if we keep our eyes only in the temporal, then it's not going to benefit.

256
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:35,140
 But imagine this, what does man gain by all the toil at which he toils under the heavens?

257
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,820
 Now that would be very different.

258
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:44,500
 You see, it's all a matter of whether God is in the equation or not.

259
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,780
 That is Hebel or it's gain.

260
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:57,220
 I want to share with you that Apostle Paul says in Philippians 121, "For to me, to live

261
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:04,140
 is Christ and to die is gain."

262
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,340
 Life for Christian is Christ.

263
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,860
 To hold him at the center, to imitate him, to trust him, to follow him.

264
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,460
 But there's actually any gain in our lives at all is actually lies in our death.

265
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,620
 Lies in our death.

266
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:28,020
 And that's death in this current time where you die to yourself and is also death when

267
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,060
 you die at the very end of your life.

268
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,580
 So this is no longer Hebel.

269
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,980
 So you see, Christians are supposed to go after Jexo.

270
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:47,220
 Actually, in fact, I would say we're the best at calculating the profits because we want

271
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,660
 eternal profits, not temporal ones.

272
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,340
 I mean, of course we want both.

273
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,740
 Let's just put it that way, but we get eternal ones.

274
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,740
 And so this is a lot of hope for us.

275
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,860
 I mean, for some of you who might be going through a job that gives you a lot of anguish,

276
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:11,260
 maybe your coworker misunderstands you and your boss mistreats you and you think about

277
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:18,220
 the temporal, I want to say, you're half dead because your coworker might never understand

278
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
 you.

279
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,900
 Your boss might never give you that promotion that you deserve.

280
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:30,140
 But if you live for eternal, what would that look like?

281
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:38,620
 What would you do in situations like that in light of eternity, in light of you being

282
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,960
 Christ?

283
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,380
 How would you treat your coworkers and how would you treat your boss?

284
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:50,320
 Your focus is no longer on their achievements or that promotion, but instead how to live

285
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,860
 out Christ.

286
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,580
 And if you do that, according to Apostle Paul, to die is to gain.

287
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,200
 And some of you might be going through a tough marriage or relationship.

288
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,300
 How do you respond in light of eternity?

289
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:15,300
 Instead of stonewalling or arguing, would you react in a way that is in light of eternity?

290
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:20,540
 How do you respect more or love more in a way that honors God?

291
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,520
 As a student, you might be struggling with study or vice versa.

292
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,460
 You're studying too much so that you just ignore everyone else or everything else.

293
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,820
 And so in light of eternity, what would you do?

294
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:43,620
 Now Stephen Curry, I hope that wakes up most of you, is an American professional basketball

295
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,460
 player for the Golden State Warrior.

296
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,260
 Now he's highly regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

297
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,660
 And he's most well known for his three point shooter.

298
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,420
 It's almost like he can throw a ball at anywhere, still gets it in, right?

299
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,740
 And he's been named the most valuable player twice.

300
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,740
 So now let's see him in a bit of action.

301
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,740
 Timeout, decide not to use it.

302
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,740
 Curry, way down to, bang, bang.

303
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,740
 Oh, what a shot from Curry.

304
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:18,740
 Curry splits the defense behind the back, fires a three.

305
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,740
 Oh, he puts it in.

306
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,740
 What a spectacular move.

307
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,740
 Timeout, Curry again.

308
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,740
 And Curry hits a three.

309
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,740
 It is amazing what Steph Curry can do with a basketball.

310
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,740
 All right, I know all of you want to watch a little bit more.

311
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,740
 But I thought I'd come back to this before I lose all of you.

312
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,740
 So Curry has been outspoken about his Christian faith.

313
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:52,740
 He spoke about his faith during the most valuable player speech by saying,

314
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,740
 "People should know who I represent and why I am who I am.

315
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,740
 And that's because of my Lord and Savior."

316
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:10,740
 And he also said that, "I do a little sign on the court every time I make a shoot or a good pass.

317
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,740
 And I pound my chest and point to the sky.

318
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,740
 It symbolizes that I have a heart for God.

319
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,740
 It's something that my mom and I came up with in college.

320
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:30,740
 And I do it every time I step on the floor as a reminder of who I'm playing for."

321
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,740
 Now, some of his Curry-1 basketball shoes--

322
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,740
 maybe some of you have it, or at least one person here should have it--

323
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:45,740
 is that there is a Lays loop that's scripted 4.13.

324
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,740
 It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4.13,

325
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,740
 which reads, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."

326
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,740
 And Curry also has a tattoo of the 1 Corinthians 13.8,

327
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,740
 where it says, "Love never fails," in Hebrew.

328
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,740
 Now, not only is he outspoken about his faith,

329
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,740
 but he actually displays it through his interaction with his teammates.

330
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:18,740
 Now, other team members have said, "You know, Curry doesn't want any special treatment.

331
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:22,740
 He doesn't ask for anything, even though he's such a great player,

332
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,740
 but he always passed the ball to other players whenever he could.

333
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,740
 And at the end of the game, he would always praise and honor them."

334
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:36,740
 Now, Steph Curry has definitely influenced many people and pointed them towards Jesus.

335
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:44,740
 Now, this is a photo of my nephew, Owen, in a Curry jersey doing his homework.

336
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,740
 I believe he's watching online right now in China.

337
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,740
 Hello, Owen.

338
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,740
 This is a bit of high.

339
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,740
 So I'm putting this up because it's cute, but also just to display

340
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:04,740
 that you can have immense influence on other people, just like Curry.

341
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:11,740
 Now, Curry said that it was actually his mom that led him and his siblings

342
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,740
 to have a relationship with God.

343
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,740
 And at the beginning of their faith, their mother actually took them to church

344
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,740
 every Wednesday and every Sunday.

345
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:26,740
 And at the same time, her mom would hold this Bible study at 6.30 every day

346
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,740
 before school, at 6.30 every day before school,

347
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,740
 for all those parents that are hearing this.

348
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,740
 And he says that his mom would pass on to the message to him over and over again,

349
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:45,740
 Romans 8, 28, "And we know that all things work together for the good of those

350
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,740
 who love God and to those who are called according to his purpose."

351
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,740
 So he knew that everything he did was for God's purpose,

352
00:25:54,740 --> 00:26:00,740
 and he would do it with all his effort and might.

353
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:07,740
 And so he also said that, "I love basketball because it gives me the opportunity

354
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,740
 to do good things for people and to point them towards the man

355
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,740
 who died for our sins on the cross."

356
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:25,740
 And he also said, "I know I have a place in heaven waiting for me because of him,

357
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,740
 and that's something no earthly prize or trophy could ever top."

358
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:39,740
 Now, both lives of Curry and his mother exemplified someone

359
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:46,740
 who don't live for the temporal, who's living for eternal,

360
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,740
 who has put Christ at the center of their lives.

361
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,740
 Rather being a basketball player, rather being a mother,

362
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,740
 they're giving it all for Jesus, for God.

363
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,740
 To live is Christ.

364
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,740
 To die is gain.

365
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,740
 So today we go back to the question, "Is life worth living?"

366
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:20,740
 Well, the simple answer is, it is if you live for God,

367
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,740
 because you would have gained your soul and that you would receive eternal life

368
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,740
 and at the end be remembered by God and received from him,

369
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,740
 the best gain that you'll ever have.

370
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,740
 But at the same time, it is all just vanity.

371
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:45,740
 Toil under the sun if it's only under the sun,

372
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,740
 but if it's under heavens, then it is worth living.

373
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,740
 And so we always have to make a decision to live for now,

374
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,740
 the temporal for yourself, or to live for the eternal and for God.

375
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,740
 Now in a moment we'll be singing "Give Me Jesus" as a response song.

376
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:13,740
 Now part of the lyrics go like this, "Give me Jesus, give me Jesus.

377
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,740
 You can have all this world, but give me Jesus."

378
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,740
 And as you sing that song, I really want you to ponder on those words,

379
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:29,740
 because I want to say that, you know, these lyrics, they're romantic.

380
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,740
 You can say it almost during a vow.

381
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:38,740
 And it's almost, it sounds as spiritual as it gets.

382
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,740
 But do you really only want Jesus?

383
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:48,740
 I mean, how much time do you spend pondering about him each day?

384
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,740
 And when you bump into a problem,

385
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:58,740
 do you think how is it that you can live in light of eternity?

386
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,740
 Or are you still trying to figure out this thing?

387
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,740
 And you see, if Curry can play basketball for God,

388
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,740
 and his mother can teach his kids to be faithful to God,

389
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:18,740
 then certainly for us, whether we are students right now,

390
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,740
 whether we are wife and husband,

391
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,740
 whether we are mother or father,

392
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,740
 or whether we are single, or whether it's grandma, grandpa,

393
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,740
 or whether we are in our profession that we are in,

394
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,740
 we can and we should be living for God.

395
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,740
 And that is the gain that we will have.

396
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,740
 So I'll ask the band to come up and play some background music for us.

397
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:53,740
 And I just wanted us to take a moment, like take a minute or so,

398
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:59,740
 where we get a chance to speak to God.

399
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:05,740
 If you felt like you haven't been living your life with God as the center,

400
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:12,740
 you haven't been looking into the eternal things, but the temporal ones,

401
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:18,740
 I invite you at this time to really repent.

402
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,740
 Say to God, "Help me.

403
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,740
 Help me to put you first.

404
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,740
 Help me to keep my eyes on the eternal

405
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:34,740
 so that I might gain the most important thing in this world."

406
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,740
 So let's take a moment now, and I will do a rapid prayer

407
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,740
 before we sing the response song.

408
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
 (Whispering)

409
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,740
 (Praying)

410
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:51,740
 (Praying)

411
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
 (Piano playing)

412
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,740
 (Piano playing)

413
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,740
 (Piano playing)

414
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,740
 (Piano playing)

415
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:39,740
 (Piano playing)

416
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,740
 (Piano playing)

417
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,740
 (Piano playing)

418
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,740
 (Piano playing)

419
00:31:52,740 --> 00:32:03,740
 Dear Heavenly Father,

420
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:09,740
 we pray that we won't be superficial Christians.

421
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:15,740
 And I don't think you have that word in your Bible.

422
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,740
 Father, we repent.

423
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,740
 There must be many times when we don't think about you,

424
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,740
 when we don't put you in the center of our lives,

425
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:39,740
 and we run as if all that matters is today.

426
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,740
 But we pray, Father, that your Holy Spirit continues to guide us,

427
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,740
 to mold us, to transform us,

428
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:56,740
 to look at what is the most important thing.

429
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,740
 We don't want to go through life

430
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,740
 and then just realize it's hebel, futile.

431
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,740
 We want to go through life,

432
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:13,740
 and in the end, know that we've gained,

433
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:20,740
 we've gained you, the most important person.

434
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,740
 So, Father, we lift up all our hearts to you.

435
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:30,740
 It isn't easy, but we pray that even with the distractions in life,

436
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,740
 that our hearts would always turn towards you

437
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,740
 in all the situations that we face,

438
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,740
 in all the places that you place us, Father.

439
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,740
 May you have all the honor and glory.

440
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:46,740
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
