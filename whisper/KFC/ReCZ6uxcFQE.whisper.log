[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   I want to ask, did anyone just come back from a trip?
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.200]   Did anyone plan to go on a trip?
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.000]   If you don't have money, I can't help you.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.200]   If you don't have money, I can't help you.
[00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.000]   Don't ask the pastor for money.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.200]   If you don't have money, you can't travel.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.200]   I know Christmas is a holiday.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.200]   I know for some of us,
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.000]   especially my group of junior boys,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.600]   I know some of you are going to take exams after Christmas.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.800]   Is there anyone who is going to take exams in January?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.200]   How do you feel? I want to ask you, friends who are going to take exams in January.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.400]   Christmas.
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.200]   It's so quiet.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   It's like you're not at the front of the school to study.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.400]   For me, I'm happy during Christmas.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.400]   Because I take exams and then take a holiday.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.800]   But when it comes to middle school, I take exams after Christmas.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.200]   Can you imagine what I do during Christmas?
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.000]   I study and study.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.600]   So, for some people, holiday is a happy time.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.400]   For others, holiday is not a happy time.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.000]   It's like they're having a hard time.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.600]   But after Christmas, there's a name.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.000]   I'm not afraid of reading the wrong word.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.800]   So I won't embarrass myself by reading the wrong word.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.800]   After Christmas, there's a calendar.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.600]   We've mentioned this before.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.200]   It's like a calendar.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.800]   If you've been to a church,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.400]   we have candles in the church.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.000]   But not for people who are getting married.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.600]   Some of you may have seen it.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.800]   What is a candle?
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.200]   It's a calendar.
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200]   We wait for Jesus to come back
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.400]   and we pray for him to be resurrected.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.800]   So, in the calendar of the church,
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.600]   the calendar of the church,
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.800]   what is it after Christmas?
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.200]   There's a day of manifestation.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.000]   I don't know if you know this.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.600]   If you've been to Eastern Europe,
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.200]   I haven't been there.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.000]   I'd like to go there.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.600]   If you've been to Eastern Europe,
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.400]   the Eastern Orthodox Church,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.200]   their Christmas is not on this day.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.800]   Sorry, it's not on December 25th.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.200]   Does anyone know when it is?
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.800]   January 7th.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.600]   Yes, January 7th.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   Or January 6th.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   This is the day of the main manifestation,
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.400]   the day of Jesus' manifestation.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   Of course, we use December 25th.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   But I think the common meaning is that Jesus is manifesting.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.600]   But what happens after Jesus manifests?
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   Jesus is crucified on the cross.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   I think you've heard this story before.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.200]   Some of you have heard this story before.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   It's not that the story is bad,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   but you're familiar with it.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.600]   But today, I'd like to share
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.400]   some unremarkable Christmas clips.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.800]   Maybe you've been to church for many years,
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.000]   and you've found some scriptures you've never seen.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.400]   Or you've never noticed the meaning of the scriptures.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.600]   But when it comes to manifestation,
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.000]   Jesus' manifestation is like a baby.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.400]   I think it's normal.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.200]   I don't know if you've ever thought about
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.600]   a story about the myth.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   Does anyone like to research about myth?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   Yes, there is.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   There's one.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.800]   Maurice has.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   Why is everyone so quiet?
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.200]   I don't know if you've noticed,
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.000]   even in Japanese animation,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.600]   there are many myth elements in the animation.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.000]   I don't know if you know.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.800]   In Japan, there is a religion called "Shinto".
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.400]   I'm not talking about the actual religion.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.400]   But there are many myths in China
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.000]   about how the gods appear.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.600]   Does anyone know how the gods appear?
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.400]   Why is everyone so quiet?
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   I thought you were watching...
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.000]   Okay, let me give you an example.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Maybe you're not warmed up.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Your brain is a bit cold.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.800]   Maybe you're not warmed up.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.200]   Okay, who is this?
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.000]   Oh, I can say it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Why can I say it all of a sudden?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.400]   I want to ask who this priest is.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.200]   Yes, in the Hellion myth,
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.000]   I want to ask what his role is.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.400]   No, not his role.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.000]   I mean, what is his function in the myth?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   What is his ability?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.800]   Yes.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.600]   Yes, so what is he?
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.400]   What is the god's image?
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   What is the god's face?
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.200]   What is his superpower?
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.600]   What is his superpower?
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   I don't know how to use this word.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.200]   Lightning.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   Yes, thank you very much, Maurice.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.800]   Lightning.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.000]   Let me read the wiki.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.200]   This is my answer to the wiki.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   It says,
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.600]   Zeus is the king of the Olympus Mountain.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.800]   He is also the king of the universe.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.400]   When he is in a good mood,
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.800]   the sun shines brightly on the sky.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.000]   When he is in tears,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   it will rain.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.800]   It sounds like a god's story.
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.400]   He can disperse the dark clouds,
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   and make the sky appear like a rainbow.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   He can also pile up the dark clouds
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   and make strong winds in the air,
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.800]   so that the sky will be illuminated by lightning.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.000]   This is my answer to the wiki.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.800]   It sounds like a god's story.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   A thunderbolt can kill people.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.400]   I don't know if anyone uses a computer
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.600]   to play the games of Greek mythology.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.200]   But lightning is not only this.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.000]   There is another one that you may be more familiar with.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.600]   Can you guess who I am talking about?
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   It's not the "Lightning and the Sky".
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.200]   Thank you.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.400]   Thank you for your answer, but it's not the "Lightning and the Sky".
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.600]   It's related to thunder.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.000]   It's the "Thunder God".
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   I think you may be familiar with this one.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.400]   Does anyone know what is the background of this?
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.600]   What is the setting?
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.400]   Yes, it's from Greek mythology.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   Wow, that was quick.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.600]   Greek mythology.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.400]   What is the god doing?
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.200]   What is the god's name?
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.000]   What is the god's name?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I will read it out loud.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It's the "Thunder God" again.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.600]   It sounds like me.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   It sounds like me.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.000]   I don't know if you have ever thought about this.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.400]   Maybe we are too familiar with Marvel.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   I guess no one has watched Marvel.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   It was over a few years ago.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.800]   Some people have mentioned someone, but I don't know if you have watched it.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.400]   I don't know if you have watched it or not.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.800]   We watch Hollywood movies,
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.400]   or watch TV shows,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.200]   or even cartoons.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   When we talk about the god, we often think about this kind of image.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.000]   Of course, some of them are a bit controversial.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.400]   But we often talk about the god's ability.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   The god we think of
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   when we talk about salvation
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.200]   is like this.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.600]   But I don't know if you have ever thought about
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   how Jesus is written in the Bible.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.800]   How is Jesus written in the Bible?
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.600]   Yes, it's in the Bible.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   We will answer that later.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.000]   It's not obvious.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.200]   How is Jesus written in the Bible?
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.000]   You should have heard this story when you were a kid.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   How is Jesus written?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.200]   You will find that there is no such thing.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.600]   What's even funnier is that
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.000]   in the early church,
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   they made a lot of baby Jesus stories to make Jesus look more powerful.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.800]   What does that mean?
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.800]   I will just mention one.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.400]   It means that a baby Jesus can jump from a building to the top of a building.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.600]   Of course, this is a fake story.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.200]   It's not in the Bible.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.600]   Don't say that it's a fake story.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.400]   There is no such thing.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.000]   But you will find that Jesus doesn't have this.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.200]   If we use the perspective of making videos,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.000]   making Jesus' story may be a waste of money.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.800]   If we make Jesus' story,
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.600]   I mean the story after Jesus' birth,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.800]   if we make Jesus' story,
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.000]   it will be a waste of money.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.600]   Because it's not obvious at all.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.000]   Let's start with a passage from the Bible.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.400]   I will not read too much.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.600]   Some of the scriptures you may be familiar with,
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.800]   but some of them you may not.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.800]   Let's start with a passage.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.200]   I will invite you to read it.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.800]   I will read it in English this time.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.800]   I will read it in Chinese later.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.400]   English first.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.800]   1, 2, 3
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.400]   We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only Son,
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.200]   who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   What does it say in Chinese?
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.600]   It says, "The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.800]   We have seen His glory, the glory of the One and Only Son,
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   the glory of the One and Only Son,
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.600]   I believe that the word "made flesh"
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.600]   is familiar to you if you are a mentor,
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.400]   or a little bit of an explorer,
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.800]   or someone who has a name.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.000]   You may be familiar with this word.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.200]   "The Word became flesh" is a more ancient Chinese expression.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.800]   If you use English, it is straightforward.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.000]   "The Word became flesh"
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.200]   Let's think about Christmas a little bit.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:48.600]   We usually think of a beautiful picture on Christmas.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.400]   It is beautiful.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.000]   Let's not even consider it an artwork.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.200]   If you have seen the Christmas decorations at church last year,
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.600]   or at the mall,
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.000]   there are less decorations at the mall,
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.600]   but you may see something similar.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.400]   You know, it is like Jesus.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.600]   You may see something like this.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.400]   Isn't it beautiful?
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.400]   There are angels.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   The Bible says that the angels are the reason for Christmas.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.000]   This is what we usually think of on Christmas.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.600]   But if we go back to 1 Kings 1,
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.200]   it is a short chapter.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   It is in 2 Kings 7.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.000]   I want to ask where Jesus was born.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   The place where Jesus was born is a place where the horses are released.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   The place where Jesus was born is a place called a "horse room".
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.200]   I have never been to a horse room.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.000]   I don't have money, so I have never been to a horse room.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.200]   I found a picture of a horse room on the Internet.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   A more beautiful picture of a horse room.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.800]   A horse room looks like this.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.200]   This is more beautiful.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.000]   But I want to ask if anyone has been to an animal park.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.600]   What do animals look like?
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.400]   Does anyone think that the animals are very fragrant, beautiful,
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.800]   and smell good?
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.400]   Or smelly?
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.000]   Or do some people think that animals are more fragrant?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.200]   I think people who have seen a red cat may feel more comfortable.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.400]   But if you go to an animal park,
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.000]   you should know that animals are smelly.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.200]   They have sounds.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.800]   Animals will scream if there is a sound.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.000]   The animals you saw earlier were very quiet.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I think the reality is that
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.200]   they may be screaming because of the sound of Jesus' cry.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   But if you imagine that animals are very noisy in an animal park.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.800]   So we think about peace.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.400]   But when I was preparing for this message,
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.600]   maybe that is not a matter of peace.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.400]   Maybe that is a noisy thing.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.200]   There are animals screaming.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.000]   Let you choose.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.400]   I think you were all born in a hospital.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.200]   If you are not, let me know.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.600]   Let you choose.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.800]   Do you think it is better to be born in a hospital
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.400]   or in the middle of animals?
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.200]   Of course, today's health perspective is hospital.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.800]   I won't ask you to be born in a horse room.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.000]   This is Jesus.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.400]   You may have heard this story many times.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.200]   But we rarely think about a real horse room.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.600]   What is a real place for animals to be kept?
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.400]   If Jesus is really so powerful,
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   why did he appear in this way?
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.200]   I just said that the gods are very visible.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:33.800]   You can tell by looking at them.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.000]   This is a monk.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.600]   This is a goddess.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.800]   But you look at the baby and say, "This is Jesus."
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.000]   Of course, we know that Jesus has a divine work.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.400]   We believe that Jesus has many divine works.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.000]   Of course, we know that the greatest divine works are death and resurrection.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.400]   But before we talk about this, let's think about the Book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.600]   We just read it.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.800]   Let's read it in Chinese this time.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.200]   1, 2, 3.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.000]   "He came to the city of Jerusalem, and dwelt among us."
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.600]   "Filled with grace and truth, we have seen his glory."
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   "He is the one who came from the Father, and is the glory of the Son."
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.000]   Jesus didn't come to play with the baby.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.600]   The Bible says that he lives among us.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   What does "live among us" mean?
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.800]   Let's go back to the Bible.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   Let me use a Lego example to explain.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.400]   We say, "He came to the city of Jerusalem, and dwelt among us."
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.600]   Has anyone played with Lego?
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.800]   Have you played with it when you were little?
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.600]   You have so few hands.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.200]   You have some hands at home.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.400]   Good thing you have one hand.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.800]   I don't play with it much.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.600]   I just build things.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.800]   I don't play with little people.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.600]   Right.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.800]   I'll pretend you've never played with Lego.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.800]   You should know what Lego is.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   Little people are cute, right?
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.200]   Imagine two days later.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.400]   The first day of 2025.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.800]   Imagine when you wake up.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   You've become a Lego.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.600]   What do you think will happen?
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:15.400]   What changes will happen in your life after you become a Lego?
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.400]   I think there are benefits.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.200]   You don't have to eat.
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.400]   You don't have to sleep.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.000]   You won't be tired.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.600]   But you can't do these actions.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.800]   Can you do these actions?
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:29.200]   I want to ask, "What are these actions for?"
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.200]   I can do this.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.400]   But can I do this?
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.800]   Can I run?
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.600]   I can walk.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.200]   But I can't run.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.000]   I shouldn't run.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Of course, you can run when you watch Lego animation.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.600]   But you can imagine a Lego.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.000]   If I use Professor Karen's example,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.200]   you become a horse.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.600]   Even worse.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.200]   Lego is still called "It hurts when you step on it."
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.400]   "It hurts when you step on it."
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.000]   "It's dead when you step on it."
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.600]   Thank you, Professor Karen, for giving me an example.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.400]   I can think of this.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.000]   Jesus became a human.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   I don't dare to say the same thing.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.400]   But at least there is something similar.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   He is not forced.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.600]   He voluntarily enters this kind of restricted situation.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.600]   How do I say this?
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.200]   I know there are some mentors who have children.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.200]   I have some classmates and friends.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.600]   My age group of friends has children.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.800]   I want to share something with you.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   I know you are younger.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.600]   But I heard from your parents.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.200]   Babies drink milk at night.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.800]   What is "milk at night"?
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.800]   It means drinking milk at night.
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.000]   Why is it like...
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.400]   It's not a deep word.
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.000]   It means drinking milk at night.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.600]   So,
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.400]   babies are in this state.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   They don't care about your mood.
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.800]   They don't care about their parents' mood.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.200]   They just drink milk when they want to.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.000]   They don't care if you are sleeping or not.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.400]   So, the most difficult thing for parents is
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:04.600]   to give babies milk at night.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.600]   I have experienced this.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.800]   I have experienced this in my life.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.000]   Don't say you haven't.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.600]   Don't tell me you haven't tried giving babies milk at night.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.000]   If you have, ask your parents.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.600]   See if you really haven't tried it.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   Babies are like this.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.000]   Babies are a very fragile concept.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.400]   They basically don't know how to speak.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   I said earlier that the Church creates stories.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.400]   So, the stories they create
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.200]   are the stories Jesus would speak in his birth.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   You don't believe it, right?
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.000]   You don't believe it's a baby like this.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.200]   It's not a magical baby.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.000]   It's not like the magical babies in movies.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.800]   At least, there is no such description in the Bible.
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.200]   The description in the Bible is that Jesus was born in this world in a very simple way.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.600]   You might ask, why is that?
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.400]   Why don't we use the biblical description we mentioned earlier?
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   We would believe it.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:01.600]   Maybe the reason is that
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.400]   when he was born in this form,
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.600]   he would let us know
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.000]   the true fragility of our hearts,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.800]   our weakness, and our struggles.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.200]   Why do I say this?
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   Let's look at a passage.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Most of the time, you won't notice it after reading it.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.000]   Let me ask you.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.200]   Who are the characters in the Bible?
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.000]   Except Jesus.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   Yes, there are a few.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Yes, there are a few.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Actually, it's not three, but a few.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   And then?
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.600]   Why is it so fast?
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.400]   Let's pause.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   This is too fast.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.600]   There are other people.
[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.600]   I believe that's what he thought.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   So, let's ignore him.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:52.200]   He's just a character in the Bible.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.000]   But there is a person in the Bible.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.400]   A king.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   I want to ask, what kind of person is King Herod?
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.600]   I heard someone say something.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.800]   Yes, a king.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   What is a king?
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.000]   A leader.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Let's use a Chinese example.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   If you are studying Chinese,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.800]   I know some people are forced to study Chinese.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:19.400]   How do you start studying Chinese?
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.000]   In Chinese history, there are kings and feudal lords.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   They are the ones who govern the land.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.400]   King Herod is one of them.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.000]   So, he's not a great person.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   He's a relatively small king.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   He has some abilities,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.800]   but he's not that powerful.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.400]   Historically, people don't like King Herod.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   They don't like him.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.000]   They think he's useless and can't do anything.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.600]   So, there is a technique in the Bible.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   What is it?
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.400]   It says that when King Herod was alive,
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.000]   Jesus was born in Bethlehem, Judah.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   There were a few philosophers and doctors from the East
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.400]   who came to Jerusalem.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.000]   They said, "When Jesus was born and became the King of Judah,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   we saw his star rise,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.600]   so we came to worship him."
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.000]   Don't say anything about the words in the Bible.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.200]   I'm warning you. Don't say anything.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.000]   What was King Herod's reaction?
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.600]   Was he very happy?
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.600]   Was he like, "Wow, that's great!"
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.000]   I see that he's very happy, so I'm telling you not to say anything.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   At least you have some concept.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.400]   But no.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.800]   There was actually a person in the Bible.
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.000]   Actually, it wasn't this person.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:24.600]   Later, I'll talk about it.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:25.800]   It was a group of people.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.800]   It wasn't the news of the star rising.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.400]   They were very happy.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.800]   No.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.000]   King Herod heard this and was very anxious.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.800]   The people of Jerusalem were also very anxious.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   I guess King Herod didn't have an exam.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.800]   He wasn't afraid because he didn't have an exam
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.200]   so he was probably afraid.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.800]   King Herod.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.800]   The reason why the Bible says King Herod was afraid
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.600]   is because he heard people say,
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.800]   "There's a king of the Jews."
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:05.600]   The title of King Herod is "King of the Jews."
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.000]   So, you see Jesus.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.800]   The Bible doesn't say that Jesus can speak.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   So Jesus didn't say that he was the king when he was born.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.600]   No.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.200]   Jesus was just born as a baby.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   But people at the time were like,
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.600]   "Is there a king?"
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.800]   They didn't know it was Jesus.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:21.600]   If you look at the Bible,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.000]   they didn't know it was Jesus.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   They just knew that there was a star representing a king.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.200]   A baby was born
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.600]   and it already made a king.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.800]   I said a king of the Jews.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:34.600]   He seemed to have some ability.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.600]   But he was already anxious.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.200]   So the reason wasn't because of the exam.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.400]   The reason was definitely not because of the exam.
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.400]   The reason was probably because he discovered something.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.200]   He didn't know if there was a person or something.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.800]   That something was impacting his source of confidence.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.400]   So, for the king of the Jews,
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.600]   this position was his source of confidence.
[00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   Today, we're not kings.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.000]   Obviously, we're not.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.800]   But I believe some things are also the source of your confidence.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.600]   Maybe you think you're very handsome.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.000]   Or you think, "Please don't say it."
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   Or you think, "You're very handsome."
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.400]   Sorry, I shouldn't say that.
[00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.000]   Or you think, "You're very handsome."
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.800]   Sorry, I'm just talking about boys.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.000]   You don't say it even if you think you are.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.800]   Maybe I'm not good at playing the piano.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.400]   I'm not saying that.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.000]   Maybe I'm not good at playing the piano.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Maybe I know a lot of Bible.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.200]   My GPA is very high.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.200]   I got a score last time.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.400]   We think about these things.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   Even if I'm not a king of the Jews,
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.000]   there are some things I think I value.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.400]   This is me.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.200]   But it's very normal.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.800]   Because this is how our society defines us.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.400]   For example, you see a pastor in church.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.200]   Or you see a student in society.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.600]   I'm a certain job.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.800]   I have a certain status.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.800]   Even my family.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   I'm someone's son or daughter.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.200]   It defines us.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.000]   And when something happens
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   that affects us,
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.200]   we become...
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.000]   We become anxious and uneasy.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.800]   What did King Heliu do back then?
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.800]   Have you read this passage?
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:06.600]   What did he do?
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.600]   Don't say that.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:12.600]   What did he do?
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.400]   He called all the priests and religious teachers
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.200]   to ask them where the cross was.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.400]   I won't talk about the rest.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.200]   You can go back and read it.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.200]   You can go back and read it.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.800]   But what are these people?
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.200]   Except for us, the Bible students,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.400]   we've been looking up
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.600]   to priests and religious teachers
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.600]   who always fight with Jesus.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.200]   But if we use the concept of the time,
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.400]   why did he call them?
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.200]   Because they were walking AIs.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.400]   I'm not using the concept of the time.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.800]   They were walking AIs.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.400]   Because they were very learned.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.600]   They could tell him,
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.600]   "The Bible says this."
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.600]   "So it might be here."
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.000]   Today's concept...
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.800]   I know you might not ask pastors or parents.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.000]   You should get your phone and ask,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.800]   "What do you do?"
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.000]   "Do you know anything?"
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.200]   You wouldn't call us, right?
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.400]   You'd get your phone and Google it.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.800]   Or I don't know if anyone is better
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.000]   at asking with an AI.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   AI can do homework.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.400]   You can ask it.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.800]   But will it help us?
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.000]   I'm not telling you not to use it.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   I sometimes use it to write letters.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   I do that.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.200]   But...
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200]   for life's problems,
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.000]   for anxiety,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I said anxiety.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   For these emotions,
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.600]   for these struggles,
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.200]   do you think asking AI will help?
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.200]   Yes. Who said yes?
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   Okay, I'll talk to you later.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   I'll talk to you later.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.800]   I'll pretend you have some problems.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.600]   For example, I have a joke.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.000]   One time, the toilet rack at my house was lost.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.400]   I didn't know how to fix it.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.200]   I searched for a way to fix it online.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.800]   And I found it.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   I was relieved.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   I was not anxious.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.200]   The toilet rack was fixed.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.200]   But there are some things,
[00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:08.000]   even if I have knowledge,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.600]   I can't solve.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.000]   Has anyone ever robbed a toilet?
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.200]   Here.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.800]   Yes. Thank you, brother.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.600]   Thank you, brother.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.200]   Thank you, brother.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.400]   You raised your hand so honestly.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.800]   Has anyone ever robbed a mask?
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.600]   I really had to search for it.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.800]   Has anyone ever robbed a check-in bag?
[00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.000]   Has anyone ever robbed a check-in bag?
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.800]   You mean the check-in bag you used to do?
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.400]   I forgot.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.200]   Did I spend too much time on it?
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:36.800]   It's okay.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.000]   I remember.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   I think there are some things
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   that we can't solve with our knowledge.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Of course, I'm not saying knowledge is useless.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.200]   If we don't have vaccines,
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   if we don't have knowledge,
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.400]   our anxiety won't be solved
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.000]   if we don't have knowledge.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.200]   I remember a friend of mine
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.800]   during the most serious period
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.400]   of the pandemic,
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.600]   he told me something.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   He said he watched the news every day.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.400]   Guess what he watched.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.600]   How many people died?
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.400]   It's true.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.400]   But how many people died
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.600]   compared to how many people were infected?
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.400]   Why do you think?
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.200]   Ah, to see if there are any more.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.400]   And?
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.800]   His logic is like this.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.400]   The more people are infected, the more scared they are.
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.000]   The fewer people, the less scared they are.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I don't know if I've thought about it.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.800]   Maybe we're all small.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.000]   But I guess...
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   I see you laughing.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I guess you've thought about it.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.400]   Anxiety is not just...
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   Anxiety is whether it's when we were small,
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.800]   or when we were adults.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.600]   Even how many years of life experience we have.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:46.000]   There are some things that I really can't solve.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.400]   So we might think Hillary Clinton is bad.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.400]   We think the legislators are bad.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.200]   But from this perspective,
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.800]   they are anxious and anxious,
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   and they are scared.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.200]   That's not unreasonable.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.000]   There are things that are beyond my knowledge.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Is it true that she came like this?
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.400]   How would I know?
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.200]   So...
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.600]   Jesus is using the baby's identity to tell you
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.400]   that he's not here to scare you.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.200]   If Jesus came like a ghost,
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.000]   then I think it's very reasonable for Hillary to be scared.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Think about it this way.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.400]   A ghost suddenly appears at the door.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.800]   You don't know what he's up to, right?
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   But Jesus didn't come to the world like that.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.800]   I've said this for a long time.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.200]   Jesus came to the world as a baby.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.600]   What does "baby" mean?
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   It's a baby who doesn't know how to breastfeed,
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.400]   but someone else is breastfeeding him.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.000]   Jesus didn't use violence,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.200]   or a way to scare us to scare him.
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.200]   I don't know if you feel like you're being forced back into the church.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   Maybe you think so.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:46.000]   I don't need you to say it.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.200]   You don't need to raise your hand.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   But think about it.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.000]   Jesus didn't force us to go back to church.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.800]   He didn't force us to follow him.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   He used a very weak sign at the time.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.000]   Even Jesus' death.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.600]   We often say that the cross is a very humiliating sign.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.800]   So Jesus' birth and death
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:10.200]   are all very weak.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.800]   The baby is weak.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   How powerful is the cross?
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.400]   But the Bible gives us a reason.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.200]   The Bible says
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   Jesus did this because
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:30.200]   he wanted to show us our weaknesses.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.000]   He was tested in all aspects,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:32.800]   just like us,
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   but he was not guilty.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.800]   This is the book of Hebrews.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.200]   This is not the book of Psalms.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.600]   This is the book of Hebrews.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.200]   What does it mean?
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   I'll give you an example.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.800]   I didn't get a zero in my exam.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.400]   If you really got a zero, tell me.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.800]   I've always had a bad exam.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.400]   Do you have any friends like this?
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.200]   How many points do you get?
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.200]   "Try harder next time. I'll get this."
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.000]   Do you have any friends like this?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   Or are you like this?
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   If you are, raise your hand.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   If you are, raise your hand.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.400]   I guess you want to hit him.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.200]   At least someone like this.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.400]   But if someone is worse than you,
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.200]   maybe he really didn't get a zero,
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.400]   but you got a zero, and he said,
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.000]   and he really said,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.800]   "So I'm the same as you?"
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.000]   "So you're that bad?
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.200]   Let's try harder next time."
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.200]   Maybe you're a bit stubborn.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.400]   At least you don't want to hit him.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.400]   You don't want to hit him like you did just now.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:35.000]   At least it's not like that.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.200]   So Jesus chose to live his life
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.000]   as a baby, a normal person.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   He didn't have no achievements. He did.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Because he had to have achievements
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.200]   for us to know he was really that God.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.400]   But in the Bible,
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.200]   he came to us like this
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.600]   hoping that we could be merciful,
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.400]   humble, and humble,
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.000]   and receive timely help.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.800]   Jesus taught us to love our enemies.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.400]   I know this is hard.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.000]   I also think it's hard to master this.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.400]   But Jesus was wronged and nailed to the cross.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   Unless you think Jesus should be nailed to the cross.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.400]   Otherwise, he was wronged and hurt.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.600]   But he said, "Love your enemies."
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.400]   Jesus said,
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   "Those who bear heavy burdens
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.200]   will come to us,
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.600]   and I will give you rest."
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.400]   But you know Jesus sleeps, right?
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.600]   I want to ask, what did Jesus do when the storm came?
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.200]   He slept.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.400]   Of course, I don't know if he was tired,
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.800]   but at least he slept.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.400]   He slept.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.400]   But only a person who sleeps
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.600]   can tell you, "Those who bear heavy burdens
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.400]   will come to me, and I will give you rest."
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.600]   I think this is more convincing.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   It's not like, "I don't need to sleep for hours."
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.000]   You wouldn't believe it if he told you that.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.400]   The Bible records Jesus' time as a teenager.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   It doesn't say much,
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.800]   but if you look at the Old Testament,
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   it's about his teenage years.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   Jesus had to eat,
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.200]   and rest,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.000]   and was scolded.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.800]   He had many failures.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.200]   But he had to go through this.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.400]   Because he wanted us to know,
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.800]   he understood us.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   He knew what compassion we needed,
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.200]   what grace we needed,
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.600]   what help we needed.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.200]   Notice, it's "temporary help",
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.200]   not "instant help".
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.600]   I know the Old Testament is about "instant help",
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.800]   but I think "instant help" is more accurate.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.600]   Because it's not, "Whenever I want, I'll help."
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   He's not talking about "instant help".
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.600]   It's not, "I'll get 0 points in the exam,
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.400]   will I get 100 next time?"
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.600]   It's not "instant help".
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   Jesus is giving us "instant help".
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   In our time of need.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:54.800]   If I can't relax my hands,
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   if I'm holding on,
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.000]   I can't get this help.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.200]   Like I said, the more we want to hold on,
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   the more we can't solve our inner fear.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.600]   I can only relax my hands,
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:15.600]   and I can understand what "instant help" is.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:22.600]   Christmas.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.000]   I know that holidays are fun,
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.800]   except for when you have to read.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.000]   But I hope that Christmas,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.600]   especially this year, is the last time we worship.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.000]   I don't know how many Christmas you've spent.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.600]   I don't know how you think of Christmas,
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.200]   or how you think of Jesus.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.400]   But I hope that we have the opportunity to think about
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.800]   the story of Christmas,
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   if I may use this word.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.000]   He's not talking about a god like Zeus,
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   playing with us.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.600]   He's not playing with us like we're a game.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.000]   If you look at the story,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.800]   there are a lot of gods like this.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.200]   I think the only one we believe in is Jesus.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.000]   He's not a god like this.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.400]   He's a god who turned into a goldfish,
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.200]   and can be eaten by anyone.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.200]   If I may say so.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.800]   He's willing to
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:16.000]   share everything that we've experienced in life.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.400]   Today's response is a bit special.
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.600]   I'd like to invite the audience to sing a response poem.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   But while you're singing,
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.800]   I'd like to ask you to lower your heads.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.400]   Please close your eyes.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:35.000]   I'd like to invite the audience to sing the first part of the poem.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.800]   It was my cross you bore,
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:19.600]   so I could live in the freedom you died for.
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.600]   And now my life is yours,
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:30.800]   and I will sing of your goodness forevermore.
