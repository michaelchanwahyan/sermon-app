1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
 And we're continuing our series called Charged, the books 1 and 2 Timothy.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
 And we're right in the middle of it.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,760
 So far, Paul has charged Timothy, who is a young pastor in Ephesus, to love.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,520
 He's been charged to uphold truth, as we see in the next slide.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,860
 We've been charged to pray.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:34,080
 And then last week, we've seen how James has led us in the charge to lead.

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:41,520
 And today we are looking at chapter 4 of 1 Timothy, and Paul's charge to Timothy is to

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,800
 serve.

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,520
 And so we're going to look at a couple of things.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,320
 To serve, we need to beware and to be watchful.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,640
 To serve, we need to be training and be diligent.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,160
 We need to be setting an example, and we also need to have devotion to the Word of God.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,920
 And so the first thing that we see that Paul tells Timothy is that he needs to beware and

14
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,920
 watchful.

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,440
 What do we need to beware and watchful for?

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,640
 Well, there are those that will leave the faith, those who will depart, right?

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,280
 And some will, you know, be departing because of deceiving spirits.

18
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,680
 Some will depart because of false teaching.

19
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:29,080
 I'm going to show you a photo, the next slide here, and it's of my high school fellowship.

20
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,240
 I don't know if you guys see me.

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
 You guys see me?

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,000
 Anybody find me yet?

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,200
 You see me with these curtains, as James calls them?

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
 I'm on the top.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,840
 Apparently, I like to climb things back then as well.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
 This is my old high school fellowship.

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,520
 And you can guess, how many people do you think are left from that fellowship, from

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,040
 high school and stayed into our university fellowship?

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,760
 Actually, only three of us, right?

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:02,160
 And I actually did a study of why are our students leaving the Chinese churches in Toronto.

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,400
 And some left because of theological issues.

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,140
 They don't really agree with, you know, the theological issues of the church.

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,360
 Some had leadership issues.

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,120
 Oh, they didn't think, oh, they were treated fairly in the church.

35
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,280
 Some others had other priorities, right?

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,460
 Some, you know, think that school's more important or they got into work or something else had

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,920
 more priority.

38
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,160
 Some didn't come to church anymore because of loneliness or lack of relationships.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,240
 People will leave the church.

40
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,360
 And Paul is warning Timothy, some people may depart.

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,360
 And some of the reasons that these people depart is because of deceiving spirits or

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,960
 false teachings.

43
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:50,040
 I remember just last year, one of the students was telling me about how he joined a Bible

44
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,280
 study on HKU campus.

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,920
 We see the next slide, a lovely partnership we had with ICF.

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,960
 Bonnie is in it.

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,160
 And we did some partnership and we connected with some of the students, had banners and

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,080
 handed out some goods.

49
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,760
 One of our students connected with a student and asked him to join a Bible study.

50
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,680
 And so he joined this Bible study thinking, yeah, it's good.

51
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,920
 You know, we're joining a Bible study on campus.

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,000
 Must be a good thing.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,960
 And slowly as he got into the Bible and he came to several sessions, he found out that

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:35,560
 this study was actually a part of a cult, a cult that suggested that these people needed

55
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,600
 to work for their salvation, that their salvation was not by faith.

56
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,760
 And Paul is also warning Timothy of certain false teachings back then.

57
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:56,980
 As we look in the next slide, he tells Timothy that these people are insincere liars whose

58
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:03,800
 consciences are seared, who forbid marriage and require abstinence from food that God

59
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,120
 created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.

60
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,040
 And so firstly, Paul is talking about the ancient practice of branding.

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,600
 They used to brand criminals.

62
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,320
 They used to brand animals.

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,880
 As you see in the next slide, you know, they used to brand horses, you know, by searing,

64
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,320
 you know, maybe their skin.

65
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,120
 And so Paul is saying that these people have been seared in their conscience.

66
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,680
 And what does that mean, that they've been seared in their conscience?

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,880
 And that means that their nerve endings, the nerve endings in their consciences that used

68
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,800
 to tell them, oh, this is wrong, or this is what God likes, has now been burnt and that

69
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,360
 they are dead to the feelings towards God.

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,560
 Marriage is a mandate, a biblical mandate.

71
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,340
 And all things, Paul says all things are permissible, right?

72
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,520
 Not everything is beneficial, but all things are permissible.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:14,060
 Paul also had, Peter also had a vision in which unclean foods were now not unclean.

74
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,800
 They were allowed to be eaten.

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,680
 And so Paul is saying that these people are going against the biblical mandate of marriage

76
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,140
 and that also foods are allowed to be eaten.

77
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,440
 And so that was one of the false teachings that they had back then, that Paul was warning

78
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,700
 Timothy about.

79
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,600
 And Paul goes on to say that everything created by God is good.

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,240
 And nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.

81
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:52,240
 God created marriage, God created food to be good things that we are to enjoy and we

82
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,680
 are to partake in.

83
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,240
 And so Paul continues, and he also says that not only are we supposed to be aware of these

84
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,680
 things that are happening, those that will depart, those that will depart because they

85
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,960
 are deceived or false teachings that will occur.

86
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,760
 He also warns us to be watchful.

87
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,240
 This passage is like a chiastic system.

88
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,680
 Do you guys know what chiastic system is?

89
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,040
 It's like it's written in A, B, C, and then it reverses C, B, A.

90
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,280
 And so the first thing that Paul tells Timothy is to beware.

91
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,600
 And the last thing that Paul tells Timothy in this chapter is to be watchful.

92
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,000
 What is he to be watchful of?

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,480
 He's to be watchful of his life, of his doctrine, and to be persevering in his ministry.

94
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:53,400
 Paul wants Timothy to be ministerially self-aware, to examine and to guard his heart and his

95
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,360
 soul so that he's not a person that is just acting outwardly, right?

96
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:05,880
 But that he, his outward actions is matched by his inward desire to serve and to love

97
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,080
 God.

98
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:14,040
 And so he says in verse 16, "Keep a close watch on yourself and your teaching."

99
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,600
 So we need to, as servants of the Lord, as we are serving the Lord, we need to watch

100
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
 ourselves.

101
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,000
 Is our life in balance?

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,080
 Are we taking care of ourselves physically?

103
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:30,360
 Are we watching our emotional needs, our mental needs, and our spiritual needs?

104
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,840
 A lot of people get burnt out, right?

105
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,320
 Because of their serving too much or their giving too much, and they're not watching

106
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
 themselves.

107
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,800
 And Paul is telling Timothy, "You need to watch your life carefully."

108
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,060
 And he needs to also watch his doctrine, right?

109
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,760
 He just warned Paul in the beginning of the, of the scripture that he needs to watch of

110
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,400
 false teachings.

111
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,960
 And now Paul is watching, telling Timothy to watch of his own doctrine.

112
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,600
 We can't just give, we can't just give without taking care of ourselves.

113
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,120
 And we need to make sure that when we give, we are giving according to the doctrine that

114
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,200
 God is teaching in his word.

115
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:21,320
 So the first thing that Paul heeds Timothy is that he needs to beware and to be watchful.

116
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,640
 The second thing that Timothy is being warned of is to be training and to be diligent.

117
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,960
 What is he to be training in?

118
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,640
 He's to be training in godliness.

119
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,960
 And let's look at the verses that were just read, right?

120
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,960
 Godliness is valuable in every way.

121
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,240
 Maybe training is, has some value, but godliness is valuable in every way.

122
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,720
 Godliness is the path towards eternal life and happiness.

123
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:59,680
 This is the first real command he tells Timothy here, you know, train, you need to be training

124
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,860
 just like an athletic person is training for the Olympics.

125
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,120
 He needs to be training for godliness.

126
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,720
 I don't know if you've heard of the 10,000 hour rule.

127
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,680
 Has anybody heard of the 10,000 hour rule before in which you need to be training 10,000

128
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,680
 hours in order to master any skill?

129
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,520
 Obviously you need to be practicing in the right way, right?

130
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,240
 Not in the wrong way for 10,000 hours.

131
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,920
 So that means eight hours a day, five days a week, 44 weeks in a year.

132
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,920
 And eventually, hopefully you'll master that talent in guitar or, you know, being a doctor

133
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,720
 or architecture, or I don't know, what does JP do?

134
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,520
 JP does board games.

135
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:56,400
 You need to be doing that 10,000 hours in order to be able to master anything.

136
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:05,520
 And so we also need to be training in our godliness to be able to be servants of the

137
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,880
 Lord that he has called us to be.

138
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
 We need to be training.

139
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,680
 We need to be diligent.

140
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:19,280
 Paul tells Timothy in verse 10, for this, we end, for this end, we toil and we strive.

141
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,740
 Ministry is not always easy.

142
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,520
 Ministry can be hard sometimes, right?

143
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,000
 There can be tough, there can be tough soil.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,560
 There can be tough times in which there are no fruit.

145
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,120
 And Paul is telling Timothy that he needs to labor, right?

146
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,520
 And there will be ups and downs of ministry.

147
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,320
 And we need to be aware of that.

148
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:49,320
 Paul is telling Timothy to be diligent, to be committed, to be engaged.

149
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,680
 Jesus was fully engaged and committed in his ministry when he was on earth.

150
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,640
 Paul was also fully committed.

151
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,520
 You know, he was beaten, he was stoned, he was kicked out, and yet he was still committed,

152
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,040
 so committed to the gospel.

153
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,960
 And Paul is telling Timothy to do the same thing.

154
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:20,160
 Be diligent, be committed, be engaged so that people will see your light and see the light

155
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,720
 of Christ.

156
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,160
 The third thing that Paul is telling Timothy as a servant of the Lord, that what he must

157
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,880
 do is to set an example.

158
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,160
 Now Paul first charged Timothy to come into ministry around 50 AD.

159
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,560
 And we know that because that's when, you know, Acts chapter 16, we see that.

160
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,200
 That's when Paul first enlisted Timothy as a teenager.

161
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,120
 And so when first Timothy was written, he was probably around 30 years old, which was

162
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,000
 around mid 60 AD.

163
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,400
 And so Paul was probably just around 30.

164
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:09,360
 And so imagine Paul telling Timothy to lead church, this church in Ephesus, and some of

165
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,640
 the surrounding churches as well.

166
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,680
 And he's only 30 years old.

167
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,200
 And so there's going to be people that are older than him, right?

168
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:24,560
 And so he's telling Timothy to set an example in your speech, in your conduct, in your love,

169
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,720
 in your faith, and in your purity.

170
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,040
 He tells, let's read verse 12 together in the next slide.

171
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:40,200
 Let no one despise you in your youth, but set an example for the believers in speech,

172
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,600
 in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.

173
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:52,400
 Until I come, devote yourself to public reading of scripture, exhortation, and teaching.

174
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:59,640
 Paul is telling Timothy, I support you in leading the church.

175
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,520
 So don't let anybody look down on you.

176
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:08,840
 That's what the NIV says, or in EIV here, ESV here, it says, don't let anyone despise

177
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,520
 you.

178
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,360
 Paul is giving Timothy a vote of confidence, right?

179
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,740
 Just like Pastor John gives us, you know, the pastoral team here, a vote of confidence

180
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,240
 to go and serve, right, us, Michelle and Pastor James to serve together.

181
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,400
 He's great at encouraging us.

182
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:34,720
 Paul is also telling Timothy, don't let anyone despise you because of your youth, because

183
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,760
 he has to teach against false teachings, right?

184
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,640
 And some of the wrong things that the people are doing at the church.

185
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,380
 And so he's giving Timothy a vote of confidence.

186
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,220
 He's telling Timothy that he needs to set an example in his speech, right?

187
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:59,880
 His speech is to be humble, not, you know, so commanding, always, you know, being aggressive,

188
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,120
 or it has to be seasoned with salt.

189
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,560
 He's telling Timothy that in his conduct, it has to be above reproach, that he has to

190
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
 be loving all people.

191
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,480
 He has to set an example in how much he has faith in God.

192
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,920
 And he has to set an example in his purity, in his integrity.

193
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,360
 I remember when I first went on a mission trip, it was to the Czech Republic.

194
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,440
 And I went with a bunch of people in my church.

195
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,000
 And I was actually the youngest person, all right?

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,140
 We went over to a small little town called Lito Měžice, and we went to teach English.

197
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,180
 We went to play sports with some of the high school teams there.

198
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,280
 And we were playing basketball against some of the high school teams.

199
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,480
 We were playing football against some of their football teams.

200
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,520
 And I was the youngest person, but I was also the most athletic person in our team.

201
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:59,240
 And so I had to lead our team, even though I was the youngest person, I was still in

202
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,760
 high school back then.

203
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,740
 I had to lead some of the older guys, let's partner together so that we can be a team,

204
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:11,320
 so that we could put up a fight against these well-trained high school students, high school

205
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,260
 Czech football and high school football and basketball team.

206
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,800
 And so I had to step up.

207
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,080
 And you know, I wasn't that confident back then.

208
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:28,440
 But over time, over a couple of those days, I had to grow in confidence.

209
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,500
 And people on my team were supporting me to go and lead us as we played against these

210
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,980
 other teams.

211
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,820
 And so Paul is telling Timothy that he needs to set an example.

212
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,080
 And so when we serve the Lord as well, we represent Christ.

213
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,000
 And we also need to set an example.

214
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,380
 The last thing that Paul is telling Timothy is that he needs to be devoting himself to

215
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,780
 the word of the Lord.

216
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:03,540
 Now Paul is telling him that he needs to have public reading of scripture.

217
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,660
 Back then, they used to read the scriptures out loud, right?

218
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,320
 They didn't have, we all have our technology back net right now, right?

219
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:19,460
 We have our phones, we have all these different versions of the vones of the scriptures on

220
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,460
 our phones.

221
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,500
 But back then, they didn't have the scriptures, it was in scrolls.

222
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,420
 And so reading the scriptures was really important.

223
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,380
 Jesus also read the scriptures out loud in the synagogue.

224
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:38,180
 So Paul is telling Timothy, he needs to focus on the word of the Lord.

225
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,900
 And when we're reading it, not only that, we need to also preach and teach so that people

226
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,660
 would understand what it means.

227
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,600
 And so when we're serving the Lord today, we need to make sure that what we are doing

228
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,580
 is ultimately preaching and teaching the word of God.

229
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,180
 And our foundation is the word of the Lord.

230
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,820
 And so Paul's charge to Timothy to serve comes with some responsibilities, as we see in the

231
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:14,660
 next slide, that we need to beware, beware of false teachings, beware of those who are

232
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
 deceiving.

233
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,980
 We need to be watchful of our own lives.

234
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,180
 We need to be watchful of our doctrine.

235
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:29,420
 Paul's charge to Timothy is that he needs to be training, just like an athletic competitor.

236
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,700
 He needs to be training in godliness.

237
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,600
 We need to be diligent in our serving.

238
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,500
 When we're serving, we need to be setting an example for our believers in speech, in

239
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,020
 life, in love, in faith, and in purity.

240
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,080
 We need to be devoting ourselves to the word of the Lord.

241
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,860
 The word of the Lord has to be our foundation in our service.

242
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:04,160
 The next slide shows us this saying, "The more we serve, the more we must reflect Christ."

243
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,300
 The more we serve, the more we must reflect Christ.

244
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,820
 Because Christ is the one who has authority.

245
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,820
 We represent him.

246
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,380
 We are his ambassadors.

247
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:25,060
 And so whether we are ambassadors in our usual service, whether we are clicking PowerPoint

248
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:33,580
 or to being on the worship team or to service leading, to preaching, we must reflect Christ

249
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,940
 in all that we do, especially when we are serving.

250
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:45,040
 And the more we serve, the more we must reflect Christ.

251
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,340
 In our society today, there are so many different people, right, that seek after money, that

252
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,740
 seek after power.

253
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,380
 But what Paul is charging Timothy and what he's charging us today is that we need to

254
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,580
 be godly men and godly women.

255
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:11,500
 Godly men and godly women must stand up and serve in our churches, in our societies, in

256
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
 our schools.

257
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:19,620
 Yes, you know, me, Michelle, James, John, we are called to be pastors full-time.

258
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,380
 And I believe that you are also a pastor to somebody, whether it's to your fellow students

259
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:33,240
 at school, that you are a pastor to the people around you at your workplace, whether it be

260
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:41,780
 your schools, your financial companies, your hospitals, your students that you're teaching,

261
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:48,980
 your architecture firms, your government places, you are a pastor to somebody.

262
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:55,260
 And Paul's charge to Timothy is the same charge to us today, that we need to serve.

263
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:01,900
 And in order to serve, we need to be godly men and godly women.

264
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,180
 And it doesn't mean that we'll always be perfect.

265
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,980
 I'm not perfect.

266
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,460
 You know, none of us here are perfect.

267
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:16,160
 But we need to be depending on the Holy Spirit to sanctify us, to cleanse us, to make us

268
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,420
 more like him.

269
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,140
 And so I'm going to end on two questions today.

270
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:25,020
 The first is, are you willing to serve?

271
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:31,740
 God has called each one of us to participate in this amazing body of Christ together.

272
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,740
 And it's not just for us to sit down and do nothing, not for 20% of the people to do 80%

273
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
 of the work.

274
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:45,580
 No, he wants each one of us to participate in the body of Christ.

275
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,380
 And he's not looking just for, you know, the older people to serve.

276
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:55,880
 No, he's looking for the younger people as well, to step up, to set an example, to become

277
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,580
 godly men and godly women.

278
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,100
 Are you willing to serve the Lord?

279
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:10,060
 And in what areas do we need to prepare ourselves in order to serve him more?

280
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,700
 Is it in the word of God, understanding the word of God more?

281
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,260
 Is it being more watchful and beware of false teachings?

282
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:29,200
 Is it that we need to send an example or be more diligent in our training to become godly?

283
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,180
 Are you willing to serve the Lord?

284
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:39,920
 And if you are, are you willing to train and to work to become a godly man, godly woman

285
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,180
 that God has called you to be?

286
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,620
 Let us pray together.

287
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:54,300
 Heavenly Father, we thank you for this calling that you've given to Timothy to be a servant,

288
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:02,340
 to serve, to be diligent, to be training, to be watchful, to set an example.

289
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,060
 And I pray for us today as well.

290
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:12,500
 You have called us to serve wherever you have called us to, whether it's our schools, our

291
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:18,140
 homes, our companies, our workplaces.

292
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:26,340
 Prepare us, Lord, that we would be your light and your light would shine through us.

293
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,740
 In Christ's name we pray.

294
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,340
 Amen.

295
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,920
 (upbeat music)
