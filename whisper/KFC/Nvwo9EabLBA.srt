1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
 One of the people that we're praying for at the moment is the Prime Minister of Britain.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,680
 I'm reminded of a comment made by a former Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, who said, "A

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,960
 week is a long time in politics."

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:23,320
 I think we could safely say that a week in 2020 is also a long time.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,520
 In some countries around the world, just this last week, the number of cases, the death

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,000
 toll has actually doubled inside that week.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,360
 Even this week in Hong Kong, I mean, restrictions have been placed.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,640
 For example, Johnny can't go to the pub anymore.

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,120
 James can't play mahjong anymore.

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,960
 Bonnie can't go karaoke.

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:55,120
 And you know, I could go downstairs and order a Big Mac and large fries at five to six in

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,400
 the evening, but not get one at five past six.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:08,720
 We are studying Matthew's Gospel and have entitled our series, "Jesus is King."

14
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:20,040
 25%, one quarter of Matthew's Gospel is devoted to the last week of Jesus' life.

15
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,880
 That's the last 0.05% of Jesus' life.

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,080
 We see, don't we, on one hand, the crowd shouting, "Hosanna!

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,760
 Jesus is King!

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,040
 Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!"

19
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,760
 Days later, the crowd shouting, "Crucify!

20
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,280
 Crucify Him!"

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,560
 In a few days, the mood has changed.

22
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
 Gone from celebration to apparent defeat.

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,320
 The so-called Savior, Messiah, the King, dead on the cross.

24
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:14,560
 The sign above His head mocking Him, Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,920
 It seems that even those who crucified Him have been listening to our sermon series.

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:30,800
 I guess that's a little how our city feels after the social unrest followed quickly by

27
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,720
 the virus.

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,800
 But we know it is not the end.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,120
 I love the book by Tony Campolo.

30
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,480
 It's Friday, but Sunday's coming.

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:56,680
 We meet today not as a people defeated, but as one poised for victory.

32
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,960
 Johnny will be back next week to talk to us about the resurrection.

33
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,440
 We are looking forward to Easter Sunday and weeks after that to Pentecost, to the coming

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,280
 of the Holy Spirit.

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,360
 And we have a choice.

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,800
 We can stay here, and I'm not undermining our serious situation, or we can prepare for

37
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:32,600
 resurrection and we can prepare for a fresh wave of the Holy Spirit.

38
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,080
 It's a dilemma having a Saturday service.

39
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,800
 I always wonder at Easter whether we're actually having a Good Friday service or an Easter

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,400
 Sunday service, or maybe a bit of both.

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:56,440
 We call this week before Easter Holy Week because it was originally the time of the

42
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,440
 Feast of Passover when the Jews were saved in Egypt.

43
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:08,440
 And because of the miraculous things that Jesus did in the last week of his life.

44
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:16,520
 During Holy Week, we wave palms in the air and hail Jesus as King, the long-awaited Messiah

45
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,080
 who's going to save us.

46
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:27,040
 Then we change our minds and scream that the Romans should crucify him.

47
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,360
 We share a loving Last Supper and he washes our feet.

48
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,280
 Then we sneak out after dinner and we betray him.

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,480
 Jesus begs us to stay with him.

50
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,440
 We promise we will.

51
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,160
 Then we don't.

52
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,520
 We abandon him.

53
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,700
 He's arrested and beaten.

54
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,480
 He forgives us and then we run away.

55
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,640
 Then Jesus is killed.

56
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,240
 We lay him in a tomb and weep.

57
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,480
 We go back for him.

58
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,040
 Then he's gone.

59
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,560
 Now he's back.

60
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,600
 Then wait, he's not dead at all.

61
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:21,000
 We witness to Christ in song and story throughout Holy Week.

62
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,880
 On Palm Sunday, normal times process with palms and songs.

63
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:38,160
 We celebrate Jesus triumphantly riding into Jerusalem on the back of a donkey.

64
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:47,000
 Men and women line the streets yelling, "Hosanna!" and waving palm branches.

65
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:55,800
 They were greeting the Messiah who they believe had come to save us.

66
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,160
 Let's hear James read that account to us.

67
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,800
 The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.

68
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,280
 They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on.

69
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,060
 A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road while others cut branches from the

70
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,280
 trees and spread them on the road.

71
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,960
 The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted, "Hosanna to the son

72
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,440
 of David!

73
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,440
 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

74
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,800
 Hosanna in the highest!"

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,800
 When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"

76
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:41,080
 The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."

77
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,000
 We can be like that crowd.

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,400
 There were the Christians in church at weekend singing praise songs, hands lifted high in

79
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
 worship.

80
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,800
 I love the song by Matt Redmond, "Blessed Be Your Name."

81
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,520
 He actually wrote this after 9/11 in 2001.

82
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,920
 He says, "Look, when the sun is shining down on me and the world and all it should be,

83
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,920
 blessed be your name."

84
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:22,040
 But then he said, "When there's pain in the offering, on the road marked with suffering,

85
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,520
 blessed be your name."

86
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,400
 On Holy Monday, we remember Jesus throwing out all the money changers and vendors from

87
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
 the temple.

88
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,680
 Now, the temple in Jerusalem was a place of worship.

89
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,960
 It was the center of worship for the Jews, and they were required to present money and

90
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:51,520
 animals for sacrifice to the priests when they visited.

91
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,760
 Johnny is going to read this now to us.

92
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:59,900
 Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all who were buying and selling there.

93
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,360
 He overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves.

94
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,120
 It is written, he said to them, "My house will be called a house of prayer, but you

95
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,720
 are making it a den of robbers."

96
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,080
 Animal vendors and money changers had set up booths in the court.

97
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,600
 People believed that God actually lived in the most holy of holy places, the inner sanctum

98
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,040
 of the temple.

99
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:36,400
 The desecration angered Jesus so much that he turned over the tables of the money changers

100
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,000
 and ran all the animal vendors out.

101
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,660
 Now before we start asking, "How dare they?"

102
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:55,360
 We have to ask ourselves, "Are the same hands that are lifted in worship at the weekend

103
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,400
 involved in something in the office on Monday that we should be ashamed of?"

104
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:12,920
 Something underhand, stabbing a colleague in the back, gossiping.

105
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,480
 This is the weekend.

106
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,560
 Let's search ourselves.

107
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:27,480
 If we find that we are a little too much like the money changers, get on our knees before

108
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,760
 the King and ask him to forgive.

109
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,060
 On Holy Tuesday, Jesus spent most of the day at the Mount of Olives, on the Mount of Olives

110
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,600
 where he preached.

111
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,920
 Our team was there in June last year.

112
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,760
 There's a picture on the screen.

113
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,280
 We get the parables of the kingdom.

114
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,360
 James spoke to us last week about the parables of Jesus.

115
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:02,480
 He was telling the crowds what the kingdom would be like and how we could join him.

116
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,440
 The parables of the two sons, the tenants, the wedding banquet, the ten virgins, the

117
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,680
 talents, the sheep and the goats are quoted in these chapters.

118
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:27,520
 I wonder if we have fully embraced Jesus as King and understand what kingdom living actually

119
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,920
 is.

120
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:39,960
 On what is strangely called Spy Wednesday, we remember Judas Iscariot, a zealot who thought

121
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,800
 he was doing the right thing by agreeing to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.

122
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:56,840
 He thought that if Jesus was jailed, the people would rise up and overthrow the Romans.

123
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,360
 Let's hear this from Paul.

124
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,440
 Then one of the twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priest and asked,

125
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,520
 what are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?

126
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,560
 So they counted out for him 30 pieces of silver.

127
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,760
 From then on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.

128
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:26,120
 On what is called Maundy Thursday, Jesus shared a common meal with his disciples.

129
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,120
 We call this the Eucharist or the Holy Communion.

130
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,280
 Many churches around the world strip their altars and cover any icons or statues on Maundy

131
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:45,400
 Thursday in preparation for the morning of Jesus' crucifixion on Good Friday.

132
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:52,200
 There will be no celebration of communion until the resurrection.

133
00:11:52,200 --> 00:12:00,400
 Many other churches hold feet washings, washing each other's feet to commemorate that Jesus

134
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,240
 washed the feet of his disciples.

135
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,560
 I'm sharing with you now a precious photo.

136
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,480
 This was actually my last day as senior pastor of the Vine Church.

137
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,320
 You'll see in this picture that Sandra and I were having our feet washed by Andrew and

138
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,600
 Chris Gardner, who were just about to take over as senior pastors.

139
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,660
 This was one of the most memorable times of my whole life.

140
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:36,360
 But Jesus reminds us that we're to love each other as he loved us.

141
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,640
 We are to metaphorically wash each other's feet.

142
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:50,060
 He equips his army, not with a sword, but with a bowl and a towel.

143
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:58,360
 Who is he calling you to minister to this Easter weekend?

144
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,800
 Let's read the story of the Last Supper from Florence.

145
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,440
 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it

146
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,980
 and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take and eat.

147
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,860
 This is my body."

148
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,400
 Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink

149
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,720
 from it, all of you.

150
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,480
 This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of

151
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
 sins.

152
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,640
 I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until the day when

153
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,280
 I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."

154
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:40,180
 When they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

155
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,120
 After the meal, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray.

156
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,640
 He asked the disciples to stay and pray with him, but they all fall asleep.

157
00:13:52,640 --> 00:14:00,840
 Jesus is left to pray for strength for what is to come by himself, abandoned by his own

158
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
 disciples.

159
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:14,320
 Judas then identified Jesus to the Roman guards with a kiss, and he was taken away by the

160
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,960
 soldiers.

161
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,460
 Now we are not entirely sure why this Friday got the name of Good Friday.

162
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,200
 It certainly wasn't a good day.

163
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:36,200
 Jesus was brought here before Pilate, the Roman governor, and sentenced to death.

164
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:43,680
 He was then forced to walk the hill of Golgotha, carrying the cross to which he would be crucified.

165
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,020
 There was a commemoration of this walk called the Stations of the Cross, which participants

166
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,460
 remember each of the steps of the crucifixion.

167
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,440
 Our team did that on the Via Della Rosa.

168
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,080
 Bonnie is going to read this account to us.

169
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,560
 From noon until three in the afternoon, darkness came over all the land.

170
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:14,280
 About three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"

171
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,720
 which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

172
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,040
 When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."

173
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:29,240
 Immediately, one of them ran and got a sponge.

174
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,580
 He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff, and offered it to Jesus to drink.

175
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,520
 The rest said, "Now leave him alone.

176
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,160
 Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."

177
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,460
 And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.

178
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:54,980
 At that moment, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.

179
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:01,080
 It doesn't sound very good.

180
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:09,280
 Good Friday is good because Christ showed his great love for man and purchased for him

181
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,040
 every blessing.

182
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:24,920
 If you've accepted his love, it's good news indeed.

183
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:30,960
 If you've rejected his love, it's bad news.

184
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:41,160
 Worse than any virus, Jesus' body was taken down from the cross and buried in an unused

185
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,560
 tomb.

186
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:52,720
 Holy Saturday ends the season of Lent, for Easter Sunday will be a celebration of new

187
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,200
 life.

188
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:03,640
 Holy Saturday is a day of waiting for the resurrection on Easter Sunday.

189
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,640
 Let's hear it.

190
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,480
 The next day, the one after preparation day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to

191
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,480
 Pilate.

192
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,000
 "Sir," they said.

193
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,640
 We remember that while he was still alive, that deceiver said, "After three days, I will

194
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,280
 rise again."

195
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,720
 So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day.

196
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,640
 Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been

197
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,920
 raised from the dead.

198
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,880
 This last deception will be worse than the first.

199
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,840
 "Take a guard," Pilate answered.

200
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,740
 "Go make the tombs as secure as you know how."

201
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:48,960
 So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.

202
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,600
 And so we leave it, the king dead.

203
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,880
 The tomb with guards and a heavy stone.

204
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,680
 I'm going to give you a spoiler alert now.

205
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,040
 Jesus did not stay dead.

206
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:15,600
 He did not stay in the tomb.

207
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,520
 He is risen.

208
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,400
 And next week, Pastor Johnny is going to talk all about the resurrection.

209
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,120
 But what about us?

210
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,720
 We can pause and reflect.

211
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:38,640
 Think about each of the days of Holy Week and what preparation you can make to be ready

212
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:47,920
 for the festive celebration and the resurrection of Jesus on Easter Sunday.

213
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,840
 I'm going to invite our worship team back now.

214
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:59,280
 We're going to sing this wonderful old hymn, "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross."

215
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,800
 I want you, perhaps not so much to sing it, but to reflect on the words.

216
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:11,200
 And let this be your Holy Week meditation.

217
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:21,200
