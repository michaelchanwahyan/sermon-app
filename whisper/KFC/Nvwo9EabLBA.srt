00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,520
 Hello KFCI, it's good to be able to gather again to hear the word and to worship through

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
 song.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,880
 We surely have missed all of you.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,560
 We hope everyone is staying safe and healthy.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:24,320
 And let's start now for today's service with some worship through song.

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:49,160
 I cast my mind to Calvary where Jesus bled and died for me.

7
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:56,760
 I see His wounds, His hands, His feet.

8
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,520
 My Savior on that cursed tree.

9
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:22,400
 His body bound and drenched in tears.

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:40,800
 The entrance sealed by heavy stone, Messiah saved and all alone.

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:52,680
 Oh praise the name of the Lord our God.

12
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,280
 Oh praise His name forevermore.

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,600
 For endless days we will sing Your praise.

14
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:14,200
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.

15
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:27,840
 And on the third at break of dawn, the Son of Heaven rose again.

16
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,760
 Oh trampled death, where is your sting?

17
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:45,760
 The angels roar for Christ the King.

18
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,760
 Oh praise the name of the Lord our God.

19
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:59,760
 Oh praise His name forevermore.

20
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,760
 For endless days we will sing Your praise.

21
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:15,760
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.

22
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,760
 He shall return in robes of white.

23
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,760
 The blazing sun shall peace unite.

24
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,760
 And I will rise among the saints.

25
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:55,760
 My gaze transfixed on Jesus' face.

26
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:05,760
 Because we are all friendly on that day.

27
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,760
 For endless days.

28
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,760
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.

29
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:23,760
 Oh praise the name of the Lord our God.

30
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,760
 Oh praise His name forevermore.

31
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:37,760
 For endless days we will sing Your praise.

32
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,760
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.

33
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:51,760
 Oh Lord, oh Lord our God.

34
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,760
 [MUSIC PLAYING]

35
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,760
 [MUSIC - "MAD OF SORROWS"]

36
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,760
 "Mad of Sorrows."

37
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:39,240
 Mad of sorrows, Lamb of God, by His own betrayal.

38
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:50,720
 The sin of man and wrath of God has been on Jesus' name.

39
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:09,200
 Silent as He stood accused, beaten, moult, and scorned.

40
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:21,680
 Bowing to the Father's will, He took a crown of thorns.

41
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,680
 Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,

42
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,680
 where Your love poured out over me.

43
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,160
 Now my soul cries out, hallelujah.

44
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,640
 Praise and honor unto Thee.

45
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,600
 [MUSIC - "SENT OF HEAVEN"]

46
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
 "Sent of Heaven."

47
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:06,080
 Sent of heaven, God's own Son to purge, his hand redeem.

48
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:19,560
 And reckonsile the very ones who nailed him to that tree.

49
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:26,040
 Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,

50
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,520
 where Your love poured out over me.

51
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:39,000
 Now my soul cries out, hallelujah.

52
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Praise and honor unto Thee.

53
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 "Now My Debt."

54
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,480
 Now my debt is paid.

55
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:59,480
 It is paid in full by the precious blood

56
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,960
 that my Jesus bled.

57
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,440
 Now the curse of sin has no hold on me.

58
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,920
 Whom the Son sets free, oh, is free indeed.

59
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,400
 Now my debt is paid.

60
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,880
 It is paid in full by the precious blood

61
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,360
 that my Jesus bled.

62
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,840
 Now the curse of sin has no hold on me.

63
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:42,840
 Whom the Son sets free, oh, is free indeed.

64
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:49,320
 Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,

65
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,800
 where Your love poured out over me.

66
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,280
 Now my soul cries out, hallelujah.

67
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,760
 Praise and honor unto Thee.

68
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,720
 "See the Stone."

69
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,120
 See the stone is rolled away.

70
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,600
 Behold the empty tomb.

71
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,080
 And hallelujah, God be praised.

72
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,560
 He's risen from the grave.

73
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,040
 Oh, that rugged cross, my salvation,

74
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,520
 where Your love poured out over me.

75
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:58,000
 Now my soul cries out, hallelujah.

76
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,480
 Praise and honor unto Thee.

77
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,960
 Praise and honor unto Thee.

78
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,960
 Praise and honor unto Thee.

79
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:23,120
 Thank you, worship team.

80
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,440
 Now we're going to enter into a time of prayer.

81
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,880
 I'm going to pray first.

82
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,360
 Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you

83
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,040
 that even though we're in the middle of this crisis,

84
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,320
 that you are still sovereign, that you

85
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
 are Lord over all things, and we trust in you.

86
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,960
 Lord, we want to specifically pray for our world leaders.

87
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,880
 Lord, every decision that they make is very important.

88
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,520
 And we ask that, Lord, you would give them wisdom to know how

89
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,040
 to make every decision.

90
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,520
 I pray that, Lord, they would surrender to you

91
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,720
 and ask the Lord of all knowledge and wisdom

92
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,480
 to help them.

93
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,280
 I pray that, Lord, you would comfort these leaders

94
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,160
 as they must be under tremendous stress.

95
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,040
 Lord, guide them by your spirit, we pray in Christ's name.

96
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,640
 Amen.

97
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,160
 Lord, I just pray for medical leaders all around the world,

98
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,660
 Lord.

99
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,920
 I pray for--

100
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,680
 yeah, Lord, just that you would continue to keep these frontline

101
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,600
 workers safe.

102
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
 Thank you for them, Lord.

103
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,120
 Just thank you for the courage that they have in--

104
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,040
 yeah, Lord, just reaching out to the sick,

105
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,360
 in making sure everyone stays healthy and safe, Lord,

106
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,320
 and in just tending for those who have

107
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,880
 been afflicted of the sickness.

108
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,720
 Lord, we just pray that you would continue

109
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,160
 to protect them, Lord, that those

110
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,480
 who are in dire need of resources

111
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,560
 would be able to get protection supplies from where

112
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,520
 they need, Lord.

113
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,100
 And we pray, too, that you would give them adequate rest,

114
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
 that you would keep their bodies healthy,

115
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,440
 especially because they're fighting on the front lines,

116
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,200
 Lord, and it's even more important for them to be safe.

117
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,520
 So Lord, we just pray for your protection over them.

118
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,720
 In Jesus's name I pray, amen.

119
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,560
 And now we pass the time to Pastor John.

120
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:11,760
 One of the people that we're praying for at the moment

121
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,560
 is the Prime Minister of Britain.

122
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,640
 I'm reminded of a comment made by a former Prime Minister,

123
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:24,600
 Harold Wilson, who said, "A week is a long time in politics."

124
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,240
 I think we could safely say that a week in 2020

125
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,880
 is also a long time.

126
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,840
 In some countries around the world, just this last week,

127
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,840
 the number of cases, the death toll,

128
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:41,400
 has actually doubled inside that week.

129
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,680
 Even this week in Hong Kong, I mean,

130
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,480
 restrictions have been placed.

131
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,280
 For example, Johnny can't go to the pub anymore.

132
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,720
 James can't play mahjong anymore.

133
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,440
 Bonnie can't go karaoke.

134
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,160
 And you know, I could go downstairs and order

135
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,040
 a Big Mac and large fries at 5 to 6 in the evening,

136
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,960
 but not get one at 5 past 6.

137
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:15,200
 We are studying Matthew's Gospel and have entitled our series,

138
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,960
 Jesus is King.

139
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,680
 25%, one quarter of Matthew's Gospel

140
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,440
 is devoted to the last week of Jesus' life.

141
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,400
 That's the last 0.05% of Jesus' life.

142
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,680
 We see, don't we, on one hand, the crowd shouting, "Hosanna!

143
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,880
 Jesus is King!

144
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,400
 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!"

145
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,640
 Days later, the crowd shouting, "Crucify!

146
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,840
 Crucify him!"

147
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,840
 In a few days, the mood has changed,

148
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,920
 gone from celebration to apparent defeat.

149
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,840
 The so-called Savior, Messiah, the King, dead on the cross.

150
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,600
 The sign above his head mocking him,

151
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,080
 Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.

152
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,120
 It seems that even those who crucified him

153
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,560
 have been listening to our sermon series.

154
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,240
 I guess that's a little how our city feels

155
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,920
 after the social unrest followed quickly by the virus.

156
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,480
 But we know it is not the end.

157
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,360
 I love the book by Tony Campolo, "It's Friday,

158
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,960
 but Sunday's coming."

159
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,120
 We meet today not as a people defeated,

160
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,320
 but as one poised for victory.

161
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,840
 Johnny will be back next week to talk to us

162
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,480
 about the resurrection.

163
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
 We are looking forward to Easter Sunday,

164
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,480
 and weeks after that to Pentecost,

165
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,840
 to the coming of the Holy Spirit.

166
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,920
 And we have a choice.

167
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,120
 We can stay here, and I'm not undermining

168
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,560
 our serious situation.

169
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,720
 Or we can prepare for resurrection,

170
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,920
 and we can prepare for a fresh wave of the Holy Spirit.

171
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,760
 It's a dilemma having a Saturday service.

172
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,760
 I always wonder at Easter whether we're actually

173
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,160
 having a Good Friday service or an Easter Sunday service,

174
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,920
 or maybe a bit of both.

175
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,040
 We call this week before Easter Holy Week,

176
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,800
 because it was originally the time of the Feast of Passover

177
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,960
 when the Jews were saved in Egypt.

178
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,040
 And because of the miraculous things

179
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,760
 that Jesus did in the last week of his life.

180
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,800
 During Holy Week, we wave palms in the air

181
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,360
 and hail Jesus as King, the long-awaited Messiah

182
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,640
 who's going to save us.

183
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,080
 Then we change our minds and scream that the Romans should

184
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,600
 crucify him.

185
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,480
 We share a loving Last Supper.

186
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,880
 And he washes our feet.

187
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,960
 Then we sneak out after dinner, and we betray him.

188
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,040
 Jesus begs us to stay with him.

189
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,840
 We promise we will.

190
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,720
 Then we don't.

191
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,000
 We abandon him.

192
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,280
 He's arrested and beaten.

193
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,920
 He forgives us, and then we run away.

194
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,120
 Then Jesus is killed.

195
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,800
 We lay him in a tomb and weep.

196
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,400
 We go back for him.

197
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,600
 Then he's gone.

198
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,080
 Now he's back.

199
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,120
 Then wait.

200
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,120
 He's not dead at all.

201
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:29,480
 We witness to Christ in song and story throughout Holy Week.

202
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:38,440
 On Palm Sunday, normal times process with palms and songs.

203
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,320
 We celebrate Jesus triumphantly riding into Jerusalem

204
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,480
 on the back of a donkey.

205
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,160
 Men and women line the streets yelling, "Hosanna!"

206
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
 and waving palm branches.

207
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,280
 They were greeting the Messiah who they

208
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,320
 believe had come to save us.

209
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,760
 Let's hear James read that account to us.

210
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,400
 The disciples went and did as Jesus had instructed them.

211
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,120
 They brought the donkey and the colt

212
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,400
 and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on.

213
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
 A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road,

214
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,160
 while others cut branches from the trees

215
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,920
 and spread them on the road.

216
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,480
 The crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed

217
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,040
 shouted, "Hosanna to the Son of David!

218
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,080
 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!

219
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,360
 Hosanna in the highest!"

220
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,560
 When Jesus entered Jerusalem, the whole city

221
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,440
 was stirred and asked, "Who is this?"

222
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,120
 The crowds answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet

223
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,680
 from Nazareth in Galilee."

224
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:54,280
 We can be like that crowd.

225
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,720
 Fair-weather Christians in church at weekend,

226
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,120
 singing praise songs, hands lifted high in worship.

227
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,360
 I love the song by Matt Redmond, "Blessed Be Your Name."

228
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:14,000
 He actually wrote this after 9/11 in 2001.

229
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,040
 And he says, "Look, when the sun is shining down on me

230
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,640
 and the world, all it should be, blessed be your name."

231
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,680
 But then he said, "When there's pain in the offering,

232
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,240
 on the road, Mark, we're suffering.

233
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,000
 Blessed be your name."

234
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,640
 On Holy Monday, we remember Jesus

235
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,880
 throwing out all the money changers and vendors

236
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,760
 from the temple.

237
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,280
 Now, the temple in Jerusalem was a place of worship.

238
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,960
 It was the center of worship for the Jews.

239
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,200
 And they were required to present money and animals

240
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,120
 for sacrifice to the priests when they visited.

241
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,360
 Johnny is going to read this now to us.

242
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,200
 "Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out

243
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,440
 all who were buying and selling there.

244
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,200
 He overturned the tables of the money changers

245
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,920
 and the benches of those selling doves.

246
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,320
 It is written, he said to them, 'My house

247
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,400
 will be called a house of prayer,

248
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,960
 but you are making it a den of robbers.'"

249
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,280
 Animal vendors and money changers

250
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,400
 had set up booths in the courts.

251
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,200
 People believed that God actually

252
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,120
 lived in the most holy of holy places,

253
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,600
 the inner sanctum of the temple.

254
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,720
 The desecration angered Jesus so much

255
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,080
 that he turned over the tables of the money changers

256
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,560
 and ran all the animal vendors out.

257
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,200
 Now, before we start asking, how dare they?

258
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:00,440
 We have to ask ourselves, are the same hands

259
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,320
 that are lifted in worship at the weekend involved

260
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,240
 in something in the office on Monday

261
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,680
 that we should be ashamed of?

262
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:18,640
 Something underhand stabbing a colleague in the back,

263
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,880
 gossiping this Easter weekend?

264
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,960
 Let's search ourselves.

265
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,920
 And if we find that we are a little too much

266
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:37,720
 like the money changers, get on our knees before the King

267
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,280
 and ask him to forgive.

268
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,120
 On Holy Tuesday, Jesus spent most of the day

269
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,720
 at the Mount of Olives.

270
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,120
 On the Mount of Olives, where he preached.

271
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
 Our team was there in June last year.

272
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,200
 There's a picture on the screen.

273
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,920
 And we get the parables of the kingdom.

274
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,920
 James spoke to us last week about the parables of Jesus.

275
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:08,320
 He was telling the crowds what the kingdom would be like

276
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,080
 and how we could join him.

277
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,480
 The parables of the two sons, the tenants, the wedding

278
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,480
 banquet, the 10 virgins, the talents, the sheep

279
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,360
 and the goats are quoted in these chapters.

280
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:31,360
 I wonder if we have fully embraced Jesus as King

281
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,480
 and understand what kingdom living actually is.

282
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,600
 On what is strangely called Spy Wednesday,

283
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,920
 we remember Judas Iscariot, a zealot,

284
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,160
 who thought he was doing the right thing by agreeing

285
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,360
 to betray Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.

286
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,400
 He thought that if Jesus was jailed,

287
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,280
 the people would rise up and overthrow the Romans.

288
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,840
 Let's hear this from Paul.

289
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,040
 Then one of the 12, the one called Judas Iscariot,

290
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,880
 went to the chief priest and asked,

291
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,040
 "What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?"

292
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,040
 So they counted out for him 30 pieces of silver.

293
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:25,280
 From then on, Judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over.

294
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,680
 On what is called Maundy Thursday,

295
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:34,600
 Jesus shared a common meal with his disciples.

296
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:39,480
 We call this the Eucharist or the Holy Communion.

297
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,240
 Many churches around the world strip their altars

298
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,920
 and cover any icons or statues on Maundy Thursday

299
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,240
 in preparation for the morning of Jesus' crucifixion

300
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,960
 on Good Friday.

301
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,160
 There will be no celebration of communion

302
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:00,640
 until the resurrection.

303
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,400
 Many other churches hold feet washings,

304
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,160
 washing each other's feet to commemorate

305
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,880
 that Jesus washed the feet of his disciples.

306
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,080
 I'm sharing with you now a precious photo.

307
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,320
 This was actually my last day

308
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,960
 as senior pastor of the Vine Church.

309
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,520
 And you'll see in this picture that Sandra and I

310
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,840
 were having our feet washed by Andrew and Chris Gardner,

311
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,120
 who were just about to take over as senior pastors.

312
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,160
 This was one of the most memorable times of my whole life.

313
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,200
 But Jesus reminds us that we're to love each other

314
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,880
 as he loved us.

315
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,120
 We are to metaphorically wash each other's feet.

316
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,280
 He equips his army, not with a sword,

317
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:58,520
 but with a bowl and a towel.

318
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:06,760
 Who is he calling you to minister to this Easter weekend?

319
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,160
 Let's read the story of the Last Supper for Florence.

320
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,840
 While they were eating, Jesus took bread,

321
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,120
 and when he had given thanks, he broke it

322
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,280
 and gave it to his disciples, saying,

323
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,280
 "Take and eat, this is my body."

324
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,360
 Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks,

325
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,240
 he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you.

326
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,400
 This is my blood of the covenant,

327
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,040
 which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.

328
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,400
 I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine

329
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,920
 from now on until the day when I drink it new with you

330
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,960
 in my father's kingdom."

331
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,120
 When they had sung a hymn, they went out

332
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,560
 to the Mount of Olives.

333
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,960
 After the meal, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane

334
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,640
 to pray.

335
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,840
 He asked the disciples to stay and pray with him,

336
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,320
 but they all fall asleep.

337
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,840
 Jesus is left to pray for strength

338
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:11,880
 for what is to come by himself, abandoned by his own disciples.

339
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:20,920
 Judas then identified Jesus to the Roman guards with a kiss,

340
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,520
 and he was taken away by the soldiers.

341
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,960
 Now, we are not entirely sure why this Friday got

342
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,040
 the name of Good Friday.

343
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,840
 It certainly wasn't a good day.

344
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,240
 Jesus was brought here before Pilate, the Roman governor,

345
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,800
 and sentenced to death.

346
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,880
 He was then forced to walk the hill of Golgotha,

347
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,240
 carrying the cross to which he would be crucified.

348
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
 There was a commemoration of this walk

349
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,720
 called the Stations of the Cross, which participants

350
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,040
 remember each of the steps of the crucifixion.

351
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,920
 Our team did that on the Via Della Rosa.

352
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,560
 Bonnie is going to read this account to us.

353
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,960
 "From noon until three in the afternoon,

354
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,920
 darkness came over all the land.

355
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,000
 About three in the afternoon, Jesus

356
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,820
 cried out in a loud voice, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

357
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:28,240
 which means, my God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

358
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,640
 When some of those standing there heard this, they said,

359
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,280
 he's calling Elijah.

360
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,760
 Immediately, one of them ran and got a sponge.

361
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,080
 He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a staff,

362
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,160
 and offered it to Jesus to drink.

363
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,960
 The rest said, now leave him alone.

364
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,720
 Let's see if Elijah comes to save him.

365
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,320
 And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice,

366
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,000
 he gave up his spirit.

367
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,400
 At that moment, the curtain of the temple

368
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,680
 was torn in two from top to bottom."

369
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:06,400
 It doesn't sound very good.

370
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,000
 Good Friday is good because Christ

371
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,960
 showed his great love for man and purchased for him

372
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,000
 every blessing.

373
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:29,480
 If you've accepted his love, it is good news indeed.

374
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:39,320
 If you've rejected his love, it's bad news,

375
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,040
 worse than any virus.

376
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:48,160
 Jesus' body was taken down from the cross

377
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,720
 and buried in an unused tomb.

378
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,320
 Holy Saturday ends the season of Lent,

379
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:03,520
 for Easter Sunday will be a celebration of new life.

380
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,680
 Holy Saturday is a day of waiting for the resurrection

381
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,120
 on Easter Sunday.

382
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,760
 Let's hear it.

383
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,120
 "The next day, the one after preparation day,

384
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,800
 the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.

385
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,600
 'Sir,' they said.

386
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,960
 We remember that while he was still alive,

387
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,800
 that deceiver said, 'After three days, I will rise again.'

388
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,520
 So give the order for the tomb to be made secure

389
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,280
 until the third day.

390
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,520
 Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body

391
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,400
 and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead.

392
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,160
 This last deception will be worse than the first.'

393
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,600
 'Take a guard,' Pilate answered.

394
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,240
 'Go make the tombs as secure as you know how.'

395
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,280
 So they went and made the tomb secure

396
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,480
 by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard."

397
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,120
 "And so we leave it, the king dead,

398
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:10,520
 in a tomb with guards and a heavy stone."

399
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,320
 I'm going to give you a spoiler alert now.

400
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,480
 Jesus did not stay dead.

401
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,080
 He did not stay in the tomb.

402
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,080
 He is risen.

403
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,920
 And next week, Pastor Johnny is going to talk

404
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,000
 all about the resurrection.

405
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,680
 But what about us?

406
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,040
 We can pause and reflect.

407
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,920
 Think about each of the days of Holy Week

408
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,960
 and what preparation you can make

409
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,640
 to be ready for the festive celebration

410
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:56,600
 and the resurrection of Jesus on Easter Sunday.

411
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,360
 I'm going to invite our worship team back now.

412
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,680
 We're going to sing this wonderful old hymn,

413
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,920
 "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross."

414
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,360
 I want you, perhaps not so much to sing it,

415
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,080
 but to reflect on the words.

416
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,080
 And let this be your Holy Week meditation.

417
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:36,760
 When I survey the wondrous cross

418
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:49,560
 On which the Prince of glory died

419
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:56,080
 My riches gained

420
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,560
 I count but loss

421
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:09,080
 And poor contempt

422
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:15,760
 On all my pride

423
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:22,280
 Forbeating Lord

424
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:28,720
 That I should go

425
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:35,280
 Saving the dead

426
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,680
 Of Christ my God

427
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:48,120
 O the vain things

428
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:54,440
 That shunned me most

429
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:00,840
 I sacrifice

430
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,120
 Them to His blood

431
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,640
 To from His hand

432
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,800
 His hands His feet

433
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:26,240
 Sorrow and love

434
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,520
 Throw me, Lord, down

435
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:38,800
 Did it such love

436
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:45,040
 And sorrow mean

437
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:51,120
 O thorns can bow

438
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,640
 So rich a crown

439
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:04,120
 Were the whole realm

440
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:10,560
 Of nature mine

441
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,720
 That were a present

442
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:23,520
 Far too small

443
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:31,040
 Love so amazing

444
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,800
 So divine

445
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,400
 Demands my soul

446
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:48,600
 My life, my all

447
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,240
 Demands

448
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:57,040
 Demands my soul

449
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,040
 My life, my all

450
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,040
 That last verse says,

451
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,640
 "Were the whole realm of nature mine

452
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,240
 That were a present, that were an offering

453
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,440
 Far too small

454
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,040
 Love so amazing

455
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,640
 So divine

456
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,040
 Demands my soul

457
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,640
 My life, my all

458
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,240
 And our response to Jesus

459
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,640
 Who went to the cross

460
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,440
 Who stayed three days dead in the tomb

461
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,840
 Is to say, "Jesus, I offer you my life

462
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,640
 I want to pray a prayer now."

463
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,640
 And wherever you're watching from,

464
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,440
 you can join in this.

465
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:07,640
 You can ask this Jesus to be your Lord and your Savior.

466
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,840
 Yes, He's King.

467
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,440
 He's King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

468
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,040
 He's ruler of the universe.

469
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:22,040
 But today, He can be King of your heart.

470
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,040
 Would you just bow your heads and pray with me?

471
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,440
 Father God, I thank you for Holy Week.

472
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:39,040
 Thank you for the mixed emotions from the crowd shouting "Hosanna"

473
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:46,440
 to the crowds asking for the death of your Son.

474
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:54,440
 We thank you Jesus that you went to the cross willingly for me.

475
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,840
 Lord, I recognize I've sinned.

476
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,440
 It was my sins that put you there on that cross.

477
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,440
 I ask you now to forgive me

478
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,440
 and come into my life by your Holy Spirit.

479
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,440
 In Jesus' name, Amen.

480
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,040
 So two things, Church.

481
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,440
 There's a worksheet that goes along with this sermon.

482
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,240
 There's some questions I've posed there.

483
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,840
 One of you just take it away and just spend this Easter weekend

484
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,840
 reflecting on Holy Week and what we've learned today.

485
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,040
 And if you prayed that prayer to ask Jesus in your life,

486
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:44,640
 drop us an email, get us on Facebook, anywhere, and just tell us.

487
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,840
 We'd love to get in touch with you and to encourage you on this journey.

488
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,640
 And we look forward to seeing you back here next weekend

489
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:57,040
 as we celebrate the resurrection of our Lord.

490
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:05,040
 [silence]
