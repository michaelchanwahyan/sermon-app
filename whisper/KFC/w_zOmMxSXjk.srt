1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
(字幕製作:貝爾)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,240
好,今日我們的主題是He is Risen

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,240
我們說He is Risen之前

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,920
你有沒有聽過有很多不同的理論

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,920
有些隱秘理論

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,920
195年

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,680
那些人

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,480
你看外面

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,480
看不到

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,480
在

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,480
在哪裡看

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,960
森林

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,960
或者是地球

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,960
他就看不到地球的盡頭

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,960
是不是?

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
有些人就叫做

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Flat Earth People

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
他們覺得世界不是圓的

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
他們覺得是平的

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
因為他們看不到地球的盡頭

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,960
他們覺得你走了很久

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,960
然後又會怎樣

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
會掉下去

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Flat Earth People

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
因為他們相信地球是平的

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,960
沒有飛過

27
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,960
有一個球星很出名

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
相信Flat Earth

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
知道是誰嗎?

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,960
Kyrie Irving

31
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,960
她是相信Flat Earth的

32
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,960
如果你上過飛機

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
你應該看到

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,960
看起來是圓的

35
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,960
第二個隱秘理論

36
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,960
是Moon Landing

37
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
有沒有聽過Moon Landing

38
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,960
他們好像1960年

39
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
1960年

40
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,960
上了月亮

41
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,960
但為什麼

42
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,960
從現在到那時

43
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
從過去

44
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,960
為什麼還沒有回到月亮

45
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,960
有些人就覺得

46
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,960
可能用Hollywood的電影

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,960
偽造了月亮的落地

48
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
還有一個隱秘理論

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,960
有聽過5G的隱秘理論嗎?

50
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
5G的隱秘理論

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,960
有沒有人聽過?

52
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
5G

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
有些人覺得

54
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,960
他們放了很多5G

55
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
你的電話有沒有5G?

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
哪有5G的電話?

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
他們以前

58
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
不知道現在有沒有

59
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,960
他們覺得放了很多5G Tower

60
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
全部人的免疫系統

61
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960
就弱了

62
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,960
弱了

63
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,960
接著他們就受了COVID

64
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
有沒有聽過?

65
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,960
有沒有聽過這個隱秘理論?

66
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,960
還有些人就覺得

67
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,960
COVID的疫苗是給你COVID的

68
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
有些人覺得

69
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,960
COVID的疫苗你放了

70
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,960
政府就可以追蹤你的系統

71
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,960
你的身體

72
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,960
有沒有人聽過這個隱秘理論?

73
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,960
很多不同的隱秘理論

74
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
我們今天說耶穌

75
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,960
耶穌復活

76
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
耶穌復活

77
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,960
都有很多不同的隱秘理論

78
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
有沒有聽過?

79
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,960
耶穌復活的不同的隱秘理論

80
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
有沒有人聽過?

81
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
OK

82
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,960
有很多不同的隱秘理論

83
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,960
我們今天會說4個不同的隱秘理論

84
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
第一是叫

85
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,960
The Swoon Theory

86
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
第二是

87
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Conspiracy Theory

88
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,960
第三是

89
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Hallucination Theory

90
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
第四是

91
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Myth Theory

92
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,960
我們在說這些不同的隱秘理論之前

93
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,960
我們先說說

94
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,960
神話是說什麼的

95
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
我們一起讀

96
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,960
Luke 24

97
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
一起讀

98
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,960
1,2,3

99
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,960
在星期一的第一天

100
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
早上

101
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,960
女人拿著她準備的香料

102
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,960
前往寺廟

103
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,960
她們發現石頭

104
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,960
從寺廟中滑落

105
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
但當她們進入

106
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,960
她們卻找不到

107
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
神父的身體

108
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,960
她們在想這件事的時候

109
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,960
突然

110
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,960
兩位穿著光明閃耀的男人

111
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,960
站在她們面前

112
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
她們的驚慌中

113
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
女人向地面向下仰

114
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
她們的臉向地面向下

115
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,960
但男人對她們說

116
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
為什麼你們要

117
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
為死亡中的生命著想

118
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,960
祂不在

119
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,960
祂已經出生

120
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,960
記得祂對你們說過什麼

121
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,960
祂還在你身邊

122
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
在加勒比

123
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,960
人的兒子

124
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
必須被傳送到

125
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,960
罪惡的手中

126
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
被祭祀

127
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
在第三天

128
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,960
再次出生

129
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,960
然後她們記得了

130
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
祂的話

131
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,960
好

132
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
這個Luke

133
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
The Gospel of Luke

134
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
是很清楚

135
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,960
說耶穌是怎樣

136
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
是死了

137
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
第三天是復活的

138
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
OK

139
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
但有不同的理論

140
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,960
第一個理論

141
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
記得名字嗎

142
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
Swan Theory

143
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,960
知道Swan是什麼意思嗎

144
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Swan是Swan嗎

145
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
不是Swan

146
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
Swan是什麼意思

147
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
記得嗎

148
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
有人知道嗎

149
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
有人知道嗎

150
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,960
Swan呢

151
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,960
是好像暈了

152
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,960
有沒有人暈過

153
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,960
有沒有人暈過

154
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,960
Fainted

155
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,960
OK 幾個

156
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
這個理論是這樣的

157
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
耶穌釘十字架

158
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,960
其實是沒有死的

159
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
祂覺得

160
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
耶穌只是暈了

161
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Swan了

162
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
OK

163
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,960
所以

164
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
祂沒有死

165
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,960
祂覺得祂只是暈了

166
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,960
我們來看看

167
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
為什麼這個理論

168
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
會不正確

169
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
第一

170
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
是Crucifixion

171
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Crucifixion

172
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,960
是羅馬的設計

173
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
怎樣去

174
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Maximize

175
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
你的受苦

176
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,960
Maximize你的受苦

177
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
令你

178
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,960
未死的

179
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
OK

180
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
有沒有人想試

181
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Maximize

182
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Suffering

183
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Towards Death

184
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
有沒有人想試

185
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,960
OK

186
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,960
第一

187
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
祂會打你

188
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
用一些

189
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
用一些

190
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Thorny的

191
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
Spikes

192
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
會打你

193
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
打到你的背

194
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
傷了

195
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,960
然後你要揹著十字架

196
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
上去這個

197
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Crucifixion Area

198
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
OK

199
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Next slide

200
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
你要揹著十字架

201
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
好像一個

202
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
一半的Piano

203
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,960
那麼重

204
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
有沒有人

205
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
幫過搬Piano的

206
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
有

207
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
OK

208
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Pure

209
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
有幾個

210
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
試過

211
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
你被人打了

212
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
又沒什麼吃

213
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
又沒什麼喝

214
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,960
然後又要

215
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,960
搬十字架上去

216
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
然後

217
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,960
被

218
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Romans釘十字架

219
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
Nails in the hands

220
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
and in the feet

221
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,960
然後你Lift it up onto the cross

222
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
你Hang在這裡

223
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
有沒有人試過

224
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Hang

225
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Crossbar

226
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
在公園那些

227
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Hang在這裡

228
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
有沒有Hang在這裡

229
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
OK

230
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,960
你Hang在這裡

231
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
可以Hang多久

232
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
一分鐘

233
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,960
誰說一分鐘

234
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,960
OK

235
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,960
上來試下

236
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
開玩笑

237
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
誰覺得

238
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,960
他Hang到一分鐘

239
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,960
OK

240
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
多過一分鐘

241
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
有沒有人覺得

242
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
OK

243
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
Jose

244
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,960
OK

245
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,960
平時

246
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
攀石那些人

247
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
是可以Hang到久一點的

248
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
其實不容易的

249
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
OK

250
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,960
你現在

251
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,960
不是Hang

252
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,960
是什麼

253
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
Nails

254
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
OK

255
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
你Hang的時候

256
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
你覺得呼吸是不是正常的

257
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
正常

258
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
是不是正常的

259
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
其實不是正常的

260
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
是要

261
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
少少拿起自己

262
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
然後才能呼吸

263
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
OK

264
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
那Cross的設計是什麼

265
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
你會自己

266
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
Suffocate

267
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
You will suffocate

268
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
因為你要拿起自己

269
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,960
OK

270
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,960
你的腳是很痛苦的

271
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,960
你的手是被釘住的

272
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
你要拿起自己

273
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,960
去呼吸

274
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
OK

275
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
The Romans designed crucifixion

276
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,960
to maximize the suffering

277
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
that you had

278
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
towards death

279
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
這些soldiers

280
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
有一個Law的

281
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
那些soldiers

282
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
There was a law laid even

283
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,960
for a death penalty

284
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
for any soldier

285
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,960
who let the prisoner escape

286
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
釘十字架

287
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,960
那些

288
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
看著那些兵

289
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
如果他看到你

290
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
他還沒死

291
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
You had the death penalty

292
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
好像你現在坐牢那些

293
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
如果那些prisoner

294
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
prison guard

295
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
給了那些prisoner escape

296
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
他自己會有個prison

297
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
death penalty

298
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,960
嚴不嚴重

299
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
很嚴重

300
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
You would have the death penalty

301
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
if you were the guard

302
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
who let the prisoner go

303
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
So there was no way

304
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,960
that Jesus could not have died

305
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
Jesus could not have died

306
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
OK

307
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
我們繼續讀

308
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,960
John chapter 19

309
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
我們一起讀

310
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,960
1,2,3

311
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Since it was the day of preparation

312
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,960
so the bodies would not remain

313
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
on the cross

314
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,960
on the Sabbath

315
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
For the Sabbath was

316
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
on the high day

317
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
The Jews asked Pilate

318
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
that their legs might be broken

319
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
and that they might be taken away

320
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
So the soldiers came

321
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
and broke the legs of the first

322
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
and of the other

323
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
who had been crucified with him

324
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
And when they came to Jesus

325
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
and saw that he was already dead

326
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,960
they did not break his legs

327
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,960
這個soldier已經看到

328
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
耶穌是怎樣

329
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,960
已經死了

330
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,960
所以沒有打爛

331
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
不是打爛

332
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
打斷

333
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,960
打斷他的腳

334
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
OK

335
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
因為是聖誕節

336
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
這個Jewish festival

337
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
他就想

338
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
這些人死了

339
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
快點死

340
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
快點死

341
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
打斷他的腳

342
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
OK

343
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
所以我們看了兩個原因

344
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,960
為什麼耶穌一定是死了

345
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
在釘十字架是死了

346
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,960
The crucifixion

347
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
OK

348
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Romans perfected the crucifixion towards death

349
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
第二

350
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
那個soldier

351
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
那個soldier是

352
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,960
差不多每天都看到

353
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
crucifixion

354
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
是不是

355
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
他就看到

356
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,960
耶穌一定是死了

357
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
第三

358
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
我們read John the gospel

359
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
John是

360
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
disciple of Jesus

361
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
他自己親眼看到

362
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
耶穌是死了

363
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
我們一起讀

364
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,960
But one of the soldiers pierced his side with the spear

365
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,960
and at once they came out blood and water

366
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,960
He who saw it was bore witness

367
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
His testimony is true

368
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
He knows that he is telling the truth

369
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,960
that you also may believe

370
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
John the gospel writer

371
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
John寫這本書

372
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,960
他親眼看到

373
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
耶穌是怎樣

374
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
是死了

375
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
是有first eye witness

376
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
還有John gospel writer

377
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
是寫了什麼

378
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,960
他們以前怎樣check

379
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
怎樣check

380
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
那些

381
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
那些

382
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
crucified的人

383
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
是死了沒有

384
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
他們用那個spear

385
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
去插

386
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,960
插那些

387
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,960
crucified的人

388
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,960
他們插

389
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,960
耶穌的時候

390
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
他

391
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
有什麼出來

392
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
有什麼出來

393
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
blood and

394
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
water

395
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
blood and water

396
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,960
為什麼會有血和水出來

397
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,960
是不是耶穌喝了很多水

398
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
他的肚被插了

399
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
然後水都出來了

400
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,960
是不是

401
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
是不是

402
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
水從哪裡來的

403
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
知不知道

404
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
ok

405
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,960
我給幾個

插了肚

409
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
肚有很多水

410
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
所以

411
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
血和水出來了

412
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
這是第一個option

413
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
第二個option

414
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
是插了他的心

415
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
ok

416
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960

417
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
有血和水

418
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
第三

419
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
是插了他的liver

420
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
他的liver somehow

421
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,960
有blood and water

422
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
ok 第一是什麼

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
第二

426
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
喝了很多水

427
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
所以插了肚

428
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
第二是心

429
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
第二是心

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
liver

432
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,960
我們1 2 3

433
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
我們會raise手

434
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
打機的朋友

435
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960

436
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,960

準備好了

440
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
ok

441
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
you raise your hand

442
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
what you think is the right one

443
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
不raise的話

444
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
我就會過來問你為什麼

445
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
好

446
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,960
1 2 3

447
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
沒有raise的

448
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
我過來問你

449
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
ok

450
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,960
你不raise的

451
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
ok

452
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
3

453
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
1

454
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,960
1 2

455
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
ok

456
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,960
你覺得是誰

457
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
ok 這些mentor覺得是誰

458
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
誰是對的

459
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,960
uncle marie覺得是肚

460
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
喝了很多水

461
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
是不是

462
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,960
你覺得耶穌那天喝了多少水

463
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
其實

464
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
不會喝了很多水

465
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
very little water

466
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,960
他聽十字架的時候

467
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
他說他很thirsty

468
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
他們給他喝什麼

469
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
醋

470
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,960
是不是給了5L的水給他喝

471
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
不是

472
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
是給醋

473
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
是不是

474
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
ok

475
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,960
有人的theory就是這樣

476
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
next slide

477
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:57,960
那些soldier插了什麼

478
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
插了他的心

479
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
這個theory

480
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
我讀給你聽

481
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
這個是一個theory

482
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
you can believe it or not

483
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
the soldier punctured

484
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
when he speared Jesus

485
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
there is a membrane

486
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
that surrounds the heart

487
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,960
called the pericardic sac

488
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
pericardic sac

489
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
when the heart ruptures

490
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
blood leaks from the heart

491
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,960
and fills the pericardic sac

492
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,960
and while it sits

493
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,960
blood will separate from the plasma

494
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Jesus did not die

495
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
of asphyxiation

496
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
which is suffocation

497
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,960
but of a broken heart

498
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
這個theory是什麼

499
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,960
耶穌不是suffocation死的

500
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
耶穌

501
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,960
他的heart attack

502
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
his heart bursted

503
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,960
ok

504
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,960
because of a heart attack

505
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,960
然後

506
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,960
他的theory是這樣

507
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,960
blood and the plasma filled the heart

508
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
the sac

509
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,960
然後

510
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,960
blood and the plasma fluid

511
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
separated

512
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,960
所以有blood and water

513
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,960
so Jesus died of a broken heart

514
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
broken heart

515
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,960
有沒有人聽過這個theory

516
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
有沒有人聽過這個theory

517
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
ok

518
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
I am glad you learned something new

519
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
ok

520
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,960
所以我們有幾個reason

521
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
crucifixion

522
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
ok

523
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Romans perfected the crucifixion

524
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
第二

525
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
soldier

526
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,960
兵沒有打斷耶穌的腳

527
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,960
因為他看到耶穌已經死了

528
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,960
第三

529
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
gospel writer

530
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,960
John

531
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,960
親眼看到耶穌死了

532
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
第四

533
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
there was blood and water

534
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,960
to prove that Jesus had in fact died

535
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,960
and we think

536
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
one of the theories

537
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,960
is he died of a broken heart

538
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
第四

539
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,960
Jesus was entombed

540
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
ok

541
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Jesus was entombed

542
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
now in the place where he was crucified

543
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,960
there was a garden

544
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,960
and in the garden was a new tomb

545
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,960
where no one had yet been laid

546
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
ok

547
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,960
so they took the body of Jesus

548
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
and bound it in lemon clothes

549
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
and with spices

550
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
and buried it

551
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,960
as was the custom of the Jews

552
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,960
這些猶太人呢

553
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,960
看到耶穌是死了

554
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,960
所以就用他們的custom

555
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
去包了他的body

556
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
ok

557
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,960
如果耶穌只是faint了

558
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
不是他會繼續breathing嗎

559
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,960
他不會醒嗎

560
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
這三天

561
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
他不會醒嗎

562
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
ok

563
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
第四

564
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960
the next reason

565
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
the disciples were convinced

566
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,960
he was dead

567
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
the disciples were convinced

568
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
he was dead

569
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Thomas

570
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
他說

571
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
主耶穌是不是真的你

572
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,960
如果真的是你

573
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,960
我可不可以摸摸

574
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,960
你的傷口

575
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
我可不可以摸摸

576
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
你的傷口在你的身旁

577
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Thomas the doubter

578
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,960
even Thomas the doubter believed

579
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
that he had died

580
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
and was resurrected

581
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
ok

582
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,960
那我們就看到

583
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,960
Swoon theory

584
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,960
conclusion是什麼

585
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
conclusion是這個

586
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,960
there is sufficient evidence

587
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,960
physical evidence

588
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Roman witnesses

589
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,960
from the soldier

590
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Christian witnesses

591
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,960
to show that Jesus did in fact die

592
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
therefore

593
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
the Swoon theory

594
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
that he did not die

595
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
that he simply fainted

596
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
is not correct

597
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
ok

598
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,960
the theory is not correct

599
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,960
第一個theory

600
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
是一個Swoon theory

601
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
第二個theory

602
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
是一個conspiracy theory

603
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,960
conspiracy theory

604
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
這個conspiracy theory

605
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
就是說

606
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
耶穌是有死的

607
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
但是

608
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
門徒

609
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
是make up this story

610
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
make up this story

611
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
耶穌是復活

612
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,960
他make up this story

613
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
那

614
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
next slide是誰來的

615
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
是誰

616
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
這個叫什麼

617
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Pinocchio

618
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
他說謊的時候

619
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,960
他的鼻子會很長

620
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
是不是

621
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
你為什麼說謊

622
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
有沒有人說過謊話的

623
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
舉手

624
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
有沒有人說過謊話的

625
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
舉手

626
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
是嗎

627
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
有些人沒有說過謊話的

628
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
wow

629
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
為什麼你們說謊話的

630
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,960
為什麼你們說謊話

631
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,960
為什麼你們說謊話

632
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
不想別人知道

633
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
真的

634
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
ok

635
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,960
there has to be a benefit

636
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,960
是不是

637
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
你說謊話

638
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
是不是因為你覺得

639
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
對你自己有benefit的

640
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
是不是

641
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
如果對你自己沒有benefit

642
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
為什麼你要說謊話

643
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
是不是

644
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
ok

645
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
so here are some of the reasons

646
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,960
why we think

647
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
that the conspiracy theory is not right

648
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
第一

649
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
是

650
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,960
the disciples challenged all authorities

651
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,960
and faced punishment on all sides

652
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,960
if it was a conspiracy

653
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
ok

654
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
如果門徒作

655
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
耶穌

656
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
是復活

657
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
他

658
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
他challenge什麼authority

659
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,960
有什麼authority

660
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
第一

661
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
是Roman authority

662
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
ok

663
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,960
他challenge Roman authority

664
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,960
是不是

665
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Romans perfected the crucifixion

666
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
soldiers

667
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,960
如果被人escape了

668
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
他們自己會有death penalty

669
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,960
so they were challenging the Roman authorities

670
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
他們又challenge什麼authority

671
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,960
the Jewish authorities

672
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
the Jews wanted him dead

673
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
the Jewish authorities

674
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
the high priest

675
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
they wanted him dead

676
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,960
so they would face punishment from the Jews

677
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,960
they would face punishment from the Roman authorities

678
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,960
there was no advantage to lie

679
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
the result was being hated

680
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,960
scorn

681
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,960
persecuted

682
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
excommunicated

683
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
imprisoned

684
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
tortured

685
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
exiled

686
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,960
crucified

687
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
boiled alive

688
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
roasted

689
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
beheaded

690
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
disembodied

691
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
and fed to lions

692
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,960
ok

693
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
有什麼benefit

694
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
沒有benefit

695
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,960
為什麼他們會作耶穌復活

696
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,960
然後說謊話

697
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
有什麼benefit

698
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
是沒有benefit

699
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,960
是不是

700
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,960
你在測驗的時候

701
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,960
是copy

702
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
cheat

703
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
你的benefit是什麼

704
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,960
你想pass the exam

705
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
是不是

706
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
但如果你cheat

707
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,960
是沒有benefit的

708
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,960
那你cheat來幹嘛呢

709
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
是不是

710
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
所以這些門徒

711
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
是沒有benefit

712
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
他challenge the Roman authority

713
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,960
是會釘十字架

714
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,960
又會被人扔去

715
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
坐牢

716
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,960
那些Jewish authorities

717
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
又會踢走他們

718
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
是不是

719
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
有什麼benefit呢

720
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,960
沒有benefit

721
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
ok

722
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
接著我們又看

723
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,960
門徒的character

724
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
我們看門徒的character

725
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
他們多數是做什麼的

726
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
門徒做什麼的

727
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
是釣魚的

728
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
還有呢

729
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,960
還有

730
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
follow Jesus

731
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
他們是不是好像magician

732
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,960
經常騙人錢

733
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
經常偷人的錢

734
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,960
我們看到門徒的character

735
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,960
是不是這樣

736
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
不是

737
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
in fact

738
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,960
耶穌釘了十字架的時候

739
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
是不是

740
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
死了的時候

741
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:42,960
他們怎樣

742
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,960
很害怕

743
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,960
他們去hiding

744
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,960
他們回到他們的房間

745
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
他們的house

746
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
hiding

747
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,960
他們害怕Roman authorities

748
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,960
去捉他們

749
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
是不是

750
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
我們看到門徒的character

751
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
不是騙人的

752
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
他們是很害怕

753
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
他們害怕Roman authorities

754
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
害怕Jewish authorities

755
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,960
所以我們的conclusion

756
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
是什麼

757
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,960
the disciples had no benefit to lie

758
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
and this went against

759
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
their known character

760
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
and their reaction

761
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,960
所以我們的conclusion

762
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
就是conspiracy theory

763
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,960
不對的

764
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
conspiracy theory

765
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
不對

766
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
第三個theory

767
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
有沒有人記得

768
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
第三個theory是什麼

769
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,960
hallucination

770
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,960
這個hallucination theory

771
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,960
是說耶穌是死了

772
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,960
但是門徒

773
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
是hallucinating

774
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,960
他們看到耶穌復活的時候

775
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
他們hallucinating

776
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
他們做夢

777
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
或者中文是什麼

778
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
hallucination

779
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,960
幻象

780
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
有沒有人試過幻象

781
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
hallucination

782
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,960
有沒有人試過

783
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Alvin有嗎

784
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
沒有

785
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
你見到誰

786
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Alvin

787
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
那些chipmunk

788
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
是不是chipmunk

789
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
在你的房間裡

790
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,960
沒有

791
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,960
有沒有試過hallucination

792
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
有沒有人

793
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
沒有人試過

794
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
你試過

795
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:19,960
你見到什麼

796
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
跳舞

797
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
是一些shadow

798
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
ok

799
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
那你見了多久

800
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,960
可能在做夢

801
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,960
吃了一些藥

802
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
ok

803
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
hallucination的definition是什麼

804
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
我們看下一個slide

805
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,960
hallucination

806
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,960
hallucination are where you hear, see, smell, taste, or feel things that appear to be real

807
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,960
but only exist in your mind

808
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
我有一個朋友

809
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,960
他之前是有些schizophrenia

810
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,960
然後又有covid

811
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
covid就isolate了他自己

812
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,960
然後他就覺得有人經常追他

813
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,960
他覺得不知為什麼一個外國人在美國經常追他

814
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,960
可能偷聽他的電話

815
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,960
黑他的computer

816
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
他經常覺得有人追他

817
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,960
他就想死

818
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,960
我有一個朋友真的這樣

819
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,960
他真的要見psychologist

820
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
吃藥

821
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,960
因為他suffer from schizophrenia

822
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
我真的有一個朋友是這樣的

823
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,960
這個朋友還在吃藥

824
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,960
他現在是improve了

825
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,960
他現在realize他之前有一個mental issue

826
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,960
he was seeing things, hearing things that were not true

827
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,960
他聽到的聲音是有人追著你

828
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,960
有人coming towards you

829
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,960
我們現在看為什麼hallucination theory是不正確

830
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,960
第一,there were too many witnesses

831
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
你們猜猜有多少個witness

832
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,960
耶穌是復活的

833
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,960
有多少人見證過耶穌復活

834
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
你們猜猜

835
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
聊天的男生

836
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:40,960
你們猜猜有多少人見證過耶穌復活

837
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
你猜猜

838
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,960
凌

839
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,960
Adam

840
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:56,960
Ethan

841
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Anson

842
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Lucas

843
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,960
到你

844
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
13個

845
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
為什麼

846
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
因為12個滿途

847
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
然後還有一個

848
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
你

849
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,960
100個

850
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,960
有沒有人想猜

851
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Kid

852
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Kid有多少個

853
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,960
兩個

854
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
2000

855
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,960
太多了

856
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
我們一起讀

857
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,960
下一頁

858
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,960
準備

859
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
1,2,3

860
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
他被埋葬

861
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,960
他在第三天被誕生

862
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
根據福音

863
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
他出現了西斐斯

864
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,960
是彼得

865
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,960
然後是12個

866
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,960
然後出現了500多個兄弟

867
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
在同一時間

868
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,960
大部分還活著

869
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
有些已經睡著了

870
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,960
然後出現了詹姆斯

871
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,960
然後是聖徒

872
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
最後

873
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,960
出現了一個復活的

874
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
他也出現了

875
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,960
我

876
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,960
這個寫大概有多少人

877
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
500多個

878
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
到12個

879
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,960
12個滿途

880
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,960
500個兄弟

881
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
然後

882
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
聖徒

883
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
到詹姆斯

884
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
聖徒

885
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
還有

886
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
誰寫的這本書

887
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,960
保羅

888
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
保羅寫的

889
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,960
他也出現了

890
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,960
然後也出現了

891
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
所以有多少人

892
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
Ethan 有多少人

893
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,960
見證了耶穌的復活

894
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,960
Yes

895
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,960
500多個

896
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
這是你們在討論的

897
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
對嗎

898
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,960
非常好

899
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
哇

900
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
非常好

901
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
第一個原因

902
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,960
為什麼幻覺理論不能正確

903
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,960
因為太多人見證了

904
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
太多人見證了

905
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,960
多數是個人有不同的幻覺

906
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,960
如果真正有幻覺

907
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
是不同的幻覺

908
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,960
但這個太多人了

909
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
第二

910
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,960
見證者是真實的

911
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
這個不是500個見證者

912
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,960
來自心理醫院

913
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
在醫院的心理醫院

914
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,960
500個見證者來自心理醫院

915
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
不是的

916
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
這些是正常人

917
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,960
他們是徒弟

918
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
他們是正常人

919
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
正常人

920
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
OK

921
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,960
不是有心理問題的歷史

922
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,960
這些是正常人

923
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,960
還有500個人

924
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,960
同時見證了耶穌

925
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
500個人

926
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,960
是一起

927
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,960
同時見證了

928
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,960
耶穌的復活

929
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,960
所以500個人

930
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,960
是整個房間

931
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
他們是整個房間

932
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
他們是整個房間

933
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,960
然後把所有人放在一種氣體

934
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,960
然後他們都看到了

935
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
會不會呢

936
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
很難

937
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,960
還有他們以前有什麼氣體

938
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
不知道

939
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
有什麼氣體

940
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
可能只有

941
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
OK

942
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
還有呢

943
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,960
幻覺通常維持多久

944
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960
他們通常維持多久

945
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,960
不久

946
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
是不是

947
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,960
但是耶穌出現了多久

948
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,960
和這些門徒

949
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
有人猜到

950
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,960
耶穌在復活之後

951
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,960
出現了多少天

952
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,960
有人猜到

953
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,960
耶穌出現了多少天

954
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
OK

955
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,960
誰覺得是

956
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,960
少於十天

957
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
舉手

958
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
OK

959
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,960
誰覺得是

960
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,960
十天到二十天

961
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,960
十天到二十天

962
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
OK

963
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,960
誰覺得是

964
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,960
三十天左右

965
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,960
三十天

966
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
OK

967
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,960
誰覺得是

968
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,960
四十天左右

969
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,960
舉手

970
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,960
OK 下一頁

971
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,960
下一頁

972
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,960
1 2 3

973
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,960
He presented himself alive

974
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
你們不讀嗎

975
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
1 2 3

976
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,960
He presented himself alive to them

977
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,960
after his suffering

978
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,960
by many proofs

979
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,960
appearing to them during forty days

980
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,960
and speaking about the kingdom of God

981
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,960
耶穌復活

982
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,960
然後出現了多少天

983
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,960
40 days

984
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
這些五百人

985
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,960
四十天

986
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
四十天

987
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,960
難嗎

988
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
五百人

989
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
看到耶穌

990
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
他們都在幻想

991
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,960
同一件事

992
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,960
然後四十天

993
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
難嗎

994
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,960
非常難

995
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,960
幾乎不可能

996
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
幾乎不可能

997
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,960
所以我們看到

998
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,960
這個幻想理論

999
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,960
多數不是正確

1000
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,960
最後

1001
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
耶穌出現在徒弟們身上

1002
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
OK

1003
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,960
耶穌出現在徒弟們身上

1004
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,960
我們一起讀

1005
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,960
我們一起讀

1006
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
OK

1007
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
男孩們在後面

1008
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
一起讀

1009
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,960
1 2 3

1010
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,960
他們在說這些事

1011
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
耶穌自己站在他們身上

1012
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
對他們說

1013
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
和平

1014
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,960
他們被驚慌

1015
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
被驚慌

1016
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
他們看到了靈魂

1017
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
然後祂對他們說

1018
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,960
為什麼你們有困難

1019
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
為什麼你們有疑問

1020
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
為什麼你們有疑問

1021
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,960
在你們的心裡

1022
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,960
看著我的手和腳

1023
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
這是我

1024
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
觸摸我

1025
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
看著我

1026
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
因為我的靈魂

1027
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,960
沒有肉和骨頭

1028
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,960
就像你們看到的

1029
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
對不起

1030
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
對不起

1031
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,960
(聽不清)

1032
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
OK 再說一次

1033
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,960
而他們仍然對快樂不信

1034
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
而仍然對快樂不信

1035
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,960
而仍然在驚慌

1036
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,960
祂對他們說

1037
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,960
你們有什麼吃的嗎

1038
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,960
他們給了他們一塊熟的魚

1039
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
然後祂吃了

1040
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
然後吃了

1041
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
在他們面前

1042
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,960
如果是驚慌呢

1043
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,960
驚慌

1044
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
平時會不會吃東西

1045
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,960
驚慌

1046
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,960
你會不會碰到牠的肉

1047
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
牠的傷口

1048
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
驚慌

1049
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
不只是這個情況

1050
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
牠吃東西

1051
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
之後牠出現

1052
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,960
吃了魚

1053
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,960
吃了不同的東西

1054
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
超過40天

1055
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
驚慌

1056
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
牠會不會吃東西呢

1057
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,960
你會不會摸到牠呢

1058
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
所以

1059
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,960
這不是正確的

1060
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
還有

1061
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,960
還有最後一個原因

1062
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,960
如果這個理論是正確的

1063
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,960
如果這個理論是正確的

1064
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
那麼耶穌的身體

1065
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
會在寺廟裡

1066
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
很容易被用作證據

1067
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
對抗教會的

1068
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,960
如果

1069
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
那些猶太人

1070
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
知道那些門徒

1071
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
是在說謊

1072
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,960
還有他們是在做夢

1073
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
在幻想

1074
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
那麼很容易

1075
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,960
他們會展示耶穌的身體

1076
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
那就是證據

1077
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,960
這是證據

1078
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,960
我們有耶穌的身體

1079
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
你們是錯誤的

1080
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
你們的理論是錯誤的

1081
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,960
那麼結論是什麼呢

1082
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,960
有很多的證據

1083
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,960
證據的角色

1084
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,960
和耶穌的個人表現

1085
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,960
顯示了

1086
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,960
幻想是不可能的

1087
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,960
是不可能的

1088
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,960
那麼我們看了三個理論

1089
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
叫什麼名字

1090
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
第一個理論叫什麼名字

1091
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,960
Swoon Theory

1092
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
不正確

1093
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
第二個理論是什麼呢

1094
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
Conspiracy Theory

1095
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
不正確

1096
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
第三個是什麼呢

1097
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Hallucination Theory

1098
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,960
第四個理論

1099
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
最後一個理論我們要看的

1100
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,960
是Myth Theory

1101
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,960
這個Myth是什麼呢

1102
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,960
耶穌的死亡和復活的教會的事實

1103
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,960
只是一個假設

1104
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
就像是希臘的神話

1105
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,960
OK

1106
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
希臘的神話

1107
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,960
第一個證據

1108
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,960
是內在的證據

1109
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
神話的內在

1110
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,960
是基督徒寫的

1111
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
四位基督徒

1112
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,960
三位基督徒和一位耶穌的追隨者

1113
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,960
博士Luke

1114
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,960
它有正確的名字

1115
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
日期

1116
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
文化日期

1117
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
歷史事件

1118
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,960
傳統和當時的意見

1119
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
我的英文很差

1120
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
我的英文

1121
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
歷史上很準確

1122
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
準確的名字

1123
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
準確的日期

1124
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,960
不單止是聖經自己說

1125
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,960
耶穌死亡和復活

1126
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,960
有外來證據

1127
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
外來證據

1128
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
很多外來證據

1129
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
我們看下一個頁面

1130
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
這些人

1131
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
這些人不是基督徒

1132
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,960
但他們也寫了關於耶穌的書

1133
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
這個人怎麼讀呢

1134
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
第一個是

1135
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
Finnie

1136
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,960
他寫了關於耶穌的追隨者

1137
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,960
追隨者認為祂是神

1138
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
第一和第二

1139
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,960
我不知道其他名字

1140
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,960
S字頭那個

1141
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,960
耶穌是真正的人

1142
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
稱呼耶穌

1143
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,960
造成了猶太人的擾亂

1144
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Selassius

1145
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
據說是一位女婿

1146
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,960
一位爺爺

1147
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
有奇蹟的力量

1148
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,960
Josephus

1149
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
說耶穌是一個聰明的人

1150
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
追隨者

1151
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
報告了復活

1152
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
Talmud

1153
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,960
在聖誕前就執行了

1154
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
有奇蹟的力量

1155
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
OK

1156
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
下一個

1157
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Thalys

1158
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
耶穌活了

1159
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960
耶穌被祭祀

1160
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,960
當祂死去的時候

1161
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
有黑暗和地震

1162
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Testius

1163
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,960
稱呼耶穌

1164
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
追隨者

1165
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,960
執行了

1166
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,960
追隨者

1167
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,960
這些全部人

1168
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
不是基督徒

1169
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
他們是歷史學家

1170
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,960
但他們寫了關於耶穌

1171
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
祂的死亡

1172
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
祂的復活

1173
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,960
祂的追隨者

1174
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
所以我們看到

1175
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,960
有內在的證據

1176
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,960
聖經自己有說

1177
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,960
耶穌死和復活

1178
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
外在的證據

1179
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,960
有些人說了耶穌的死

1180
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
祂的復活

1181
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
追隨者

1182
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
還有什麼

1183
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,960
如果門徒是作這個故事

1184
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,960
為什麼他們會

1185
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,960
誰是耶穌的復活的第一itness

1186
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,960
誰是第一itness

1187
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
誰是

1188
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,960
第一

1189
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,960
看到空的墓地

1190
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,960
是誰

1191
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,960
是女人

1192
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
如果你是

1193
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
作一個故事

1194
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,960
為什麼你會用

1195
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
第一itness

1196
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
作為女人

1197
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,960
女人以前不是

1198
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,960
可信的itness

1199
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
為什麼你不用一個

1200
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
很可信的itness

1201
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
一個high priest

1202
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
一個teacher of the law

1203
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
一個saducee

1204
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,960
去first witness

1205
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
空的墓地

1206
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,960
他們用女人

1207
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,960
作為第一itness

1208
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
以前女人

1209
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,960
不是可信的itness

1210
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
還有呢

1211
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,960
如果門徒是作這個

1212
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
復活故事

1213
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
這違反了

1214
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
耶穌的復活的規則

1215
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
之前的猶太人

1216
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,960
覺得復活是何時會復活

1217
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
知不知道

1218
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
有人知嗎

1219
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,960
有人知嗎

1220
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
猶太人之前是覺得

1221
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
何時才會復活

1222
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,960
on the last days

1223
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,960
you remember Mary and Martha

1224
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Martha was like

1225
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
oh yeah we believe in the resurrection

1226
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,960
the resurrection will happen on the last day

1227
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
which is

1228
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,960
when the Messiah comes

1229
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,960
and restores everything

1230
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,960
他們不知道

1231
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
they did not believe that

1232
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Jesus would resurrect

1233
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
it was against their custom

1234
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,960
還有呢

1235
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
they did not believe that

1236
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,960
the Messiah needed to resurrect either

1237
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,960
they did not believe the Messiah would die

1238
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,960
so this went against their Jewish customs

1239
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
so disciples would have to be

1240
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
really creative

1241
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
to make up this story

1242
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
還有呢

1243
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
the religious opponents

1244
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,960
could not produce Jesus' body

1245
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
我們

1246
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,960
and the soldiers were bribed

1247
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,960
to spread lies

1248
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,960
yet still people believed in the resurrection

1249
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,960
alright let's look at the next passage

1250
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
when the chief priests

1251
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,960
had met with the elders

1252
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
and devised a plan

1253
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
they gave the soldiers a large sum of money

1254
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,960
telling them

1255
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,960
you are to say

1256
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
the disciples came during the night

1257
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
and stole the body

1258
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
while they were away

1259
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,960
for this report

1260
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,960
gets to the governor

1261
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,960
he will be satisfied

1262
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,960
and keep you out of trouble

1263
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,960
他們是給錢

1264
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
給了錢

1265
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
the disciples

1266
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
去說謊

1267
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,960
and yet they

1268
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
the people still believed

1269
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
in the resurrection

1270
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,960
so therefore the conclusion is

1271
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
the synoptic gospels

1272
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,960
offer us evidence

1273
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,960
that the disciples did not make up this story

1274
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,960
that there is external evidence about Jesus

1275
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
also confirms this

1276
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
and the religious authorities

1277
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
could easily reveal the body of Christ

1278
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,960
if the resurrection were not true

1279
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,960
所以我們看到四個理論

1280
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,960
今天

1281
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
ok

1282
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,960
Spoon theory

1283
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Conspiracy theory

1284
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Hallucination theory

1285
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,960
The myth theory

1286
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,960
全部都覺得沒有什麼證據

1287
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
for these theories

1288
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
therefore we believe

1289
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,960
that Jesus has risen

1290
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Jesus has risen

1291
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,960
Jesus is alive

1292
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,960
the difference between Christianity

1293
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
and all other religions in the world

1294
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
is what

1295
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,960
is that our God lives

1296
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
our God lives

1297
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Islam

1298
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,960
did Muhammad die

1299
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Muhammad died

1300
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,960
Buddha

1301
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,960
did Buddha die

1302
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
Buddha died

1303
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Johnny

1304
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
Confucius

1305
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,960
did he die

1306
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
Confucius died

1307
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
but Christianity is different

1308
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
and it is special

1309
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,960
because Christianity

1310
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Jesus did not die

1311
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
we have a God that lives

1312
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
that is what makes

1313
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,960
Christianity so special

1314
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,960
and that is why

1315
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,960
your belief in Christianity

1316
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
is meaningful

1317
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,960
because we believe in a God

1318
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
that lives

1319
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,960
and so as the band comes up

1320
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
I want us to think about

1321
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,960
today

1322
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,960
as the band comes up

1323
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,960
我們每個人閉上眼

1324
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,960
let's close our eyes

1325
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,960
let's turn off our phones

1326
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,960
let's stop playing games for a sec

1327
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
let's just talk between you and God

1328
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
you want to talk

1329
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
talk to God

1330
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,960
ok

1331
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:49,960
let's close our eyes

1332
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
if you want to talk

1333
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
talk to the Lord

1334
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,960
let's talk to the Lord right now

1335
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,960
maybe you've come to church so many times

1336
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,960
you've heard the Easter message so many times

1337
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,960
and yet you've never actually believed

1338
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
that Jesus died

1339
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,960
and He rose again

1340
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,960
are you one of these people today

1341
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,960
are you one of these people today

1342
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
maybe you've come to church a long time

1343
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,960
your parents are forcing you to come to church

1344
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,960
and you have not actually believed

1345
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,960
that Jesus has died

1346
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,960
and rose again

1347
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,960
today we talked about four theories

1348
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,960
we broke down why these four theories are not correct

1349
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,960
and that is why we believe Jesus is alive

1350
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,960
our God lives

1351
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,960
let's everybody just close your eyes right now

1352
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,960
close your eyes

1353
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,960
have you come to a point

1354
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,960
where God is real to you

1355
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,960
Jesus is real to you

1356
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Jesus is the greatest person alive

1357
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,960
He's better than any Instagram influencer

1358
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,960
YouTube influencer

1359
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,960
He's greater than any athlete

1360
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,960
any debater

1361
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,960
He's better than all these people

1362
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,960
because He died and rose again

1363
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
Our God is not dead

1364
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
if Jesus died and did not rise

1365
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
I would not stand here

1366
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,960
because He's no different than Buddha

1367
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,960
Mohammed

1368
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,960
those guys died

1369
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Confucius

1370
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,960
they died

1371
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,960
but I stand here today

1372
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,960
and I spend my time

1373
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,960
I've spent all my life

1374
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,960
trying to convince people

1375
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,960
that Jesus is alive

1376
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,960
and that is why I stand here

1377
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,960
and I want to challenge each one of you tonight

1378
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
today

1379
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,960
have you made a decision

1380
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,960
to put your trust

1381
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:14,960
in a God that is alive

1382
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,960
