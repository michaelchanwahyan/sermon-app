1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
大家早晨

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:04,600
今日嘅題目係你今日信咗未

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,600
咁呢如果有人呢係同我個年紀差唔多啦

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,400
姐係好老啦

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,600
咁我認我認自己老嘅好老啦

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,400
咁你可能會估到我個靈感喺邊嘅

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,600
咁我靈感喺邊呢

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,800
就講個爛嘅先

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,000
真係好爛㗎呢個

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,600
蘋果汁係蘋果味

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,800
橙汁係橙味

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,600
益力多係咩味呀

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,800
你今日飲咗咩

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,600
幾好喎原來我好young喎ok喎

15
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,000
好爛

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,800
我叫咗唔好嚇我㗎啦

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,800
你今日飲咗未啦

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,600
呢個廣告呢其實都幾深刻㗎

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,600
就算我相信就算年紀好細嘅人都會飲益力多嘅都會

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,600
點解呢句咁深刻呢

21
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,000
可能你每次畀人咁樣問嘅時候

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,600
諗係喎我有冇飲呢

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,000
然後從一個商業的角度嚟講

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,200
咁我應該飲下喎問你飲咗未呀

25
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,600
咁我未飲咁我飲下啦

26
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,600
所以今日嘅題目係

27
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,200
少少嘅inspiration喺呢度

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,800
可能我哋覺得信耶穌係一個我哋

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,600
由細到大我返咗教會我就叫信耶穌啦

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,800
我舉咗手就叫信耶穌啦

31
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,000
但係我哋好寫教會問你

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,800
你今日信咗未㗎

33
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,600
而家你成日問下你今日信咗未㗎

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,000
你覺得你信咗就舉手呀

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,200
我想問唔舉手嘅意思係咪即係你今日未信㗎

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,800
我希望今日呢篇summit完咗之後

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,400
你有一個你自己嘅答案

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,800
呢度唔係逼大家要去到相信啲乜嘢

39
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,200
而係信仰本來就係一個每一日都要行嘅歷程

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,600
特別係呢一個new year start嘅時候

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
都有好嘅機會同大家講啦

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,000
咁正如我哋打機有login㗎嘛係咪

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,800
即係daily reward㗎嘛

44
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,400
其實唔係每一日嘅嘢你都想要㗎

45
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,000
大概我哋啲daily login都係去到某一日

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,600
你有好想要嘅嘢嘅時候

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,800
咁你前面好多日都要login㗎啦係咪

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,000
即係嗰啲嘢冇乜用嘅

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,600
你覺得唔關你事你唔係想要

50
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,400
你都會堅持去login為咗嗰一日

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,800
為咗去到第十五日你就可以要到你想要嘅嘢

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,200
所以信仰其實都好類似呢個位

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,800
我哋每日login唔一定有啲好特別

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,000
或者你好鍾意嘅嘢啦

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,800
有啲人可能好鍾意啦有啲人唔會啦

56
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,200
但係去到最後嗰日你會攞到最想要嘅嘢

57
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,400
所以今日我哋講嘅呢卷書卷

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,400
同埋嚟緊呢一兩個月我哋會去到分享嘅訊息

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,000
都係環繞返一啲可能好fundamental嘅嘢

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
我哋每日去相信嘅時候我哋做緊啲咩呢

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,600
今次我哋講嘅書卷係貼薩羅尼加前書

62
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,400
呢卷書講乜嘢嘅呢

63
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
係講一間教會

64
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
呢間教會有咩特別呢

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
就係有一堆人都同我哋有啲似嘅

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,600
可能係啱啱信或者對信仰有啲好簡單嘅認識

67
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,200
半分鐘去講下個背景

68
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,000
半分鐘個背景係咩呢

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,400
貼薩羅尼加係一個地方

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,600
呢個地方係同香港有少少似嘅

71
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,400
就係佢都係當時希臘呢個地方

72
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,400
一個好大嘅都會

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
好多嘅貿易

74
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,000
啲人都好多嘅錢

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,200
好多嘅文化

76
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,800
所以呢個同香港有啲似嘅

77
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,600
我哋有好多嘅文化交集

78
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,600
呢個城市都係咁嘅

79
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
咁喺聖經裏面講咩呢

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
就係話保羅去到呢間教會

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,200
即係去到呢間地方建立咗間教會

82
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,400
咁但係聖經就話佢好快就走咗

83
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,600
即係因住其他原因

84
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
即係因住畀人去講

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
即係畀人去攻擊就話

86
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,000
喂你搞事喎你喺度

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
咁於是佢走咗啦

88
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
所以呢間教會嘅人呢

89
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,200
可以話係某程度上係幾初信

90
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,600
所以寫信寫呢篇書信嘅目的

91
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,600
就係幫助佢哋明白個信仰嘅基礎係乜嘢

92
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,000
可能你坐喺度就問啦

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,400
喂我返到十幾年喎

94
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,800
即係有冇人係

95
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,000
係有冇一個套影返緊教會嘅呢度

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,600
有喎

97
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
有喎

98
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,400
其實我都係嘅

99
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,000
我都係嘅

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
不過我中學有一段好長嘅時間

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,800
唔返教會嘅

102
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
去到大學

103
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,200
咁有機會再分享啦

104
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,200
可能你由冇福返教會到而家

105
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,600
你話我返到十幾廿年嘅喎

106
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,200
我都初信

107
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,600
但係如果我係將初信嘅定義

108
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,400
唔係定義個時間

109
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,800
而係我哋嘅moral value

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,400
我哋嘅lifestyle

111
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,800
我哋係咪真係跟緊呢個信仰呢

112
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,000
咁我估計可能我哋在座好多

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,200
都其實係初信

114
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,400
可能我哋呢一刻我哋嘅world view

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
我哋嘅世界觀

116
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,600
其實我哋係conform to the world

117
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,400
我哋只係跟住個世界行

118
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,000
而唔係跟住耶穌想我哋行嘅行

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,600
所以今日會係一個短嘅訊息

120
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,800
但係有三點係希望我哋諗下

121
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,400
呢個信仰係要我做啲乜嘢

122
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,800
第一樣嘢係信仰係要付出嘅

123
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
信仰係要付出嘅

124
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,000
咁呢我想請後面PA team

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,400
係咪已經有咪㗎啦

126
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,600
係 麻煩請Andrew幫我讀

127
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,600
貼哂我哋嚟加前書

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,200
1 Thessalonians 1st Thessalonians

129
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,600
Chapter 1, Verse 3

130
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,800
讀英文

131
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
好

132
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,000
We remember before our God and Father

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,800
your work produced by faith,

134
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,800
your labor prompted by love,

135
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
and your endurance inspired by hope

136
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,400
in our Lord Jesus Christ

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,800
好 多謝Andrew

138
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,600
呢句呢

139
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
如果有啲人讀聖經讀得比較多

140
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
你會留意到有三個element

141
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,600
即係faith, love, 同埋hope

142
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,200
但呢啲元素喺經文裏面講咩呢

143
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
其實係會produce

144
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,600
inspire我哋去做一啲嘅回應

145
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
我哋成日諗呢啲嘅元素

146
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
好想諗到就係我可唔可以feel到

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
即係我哋今日都好想諗

148
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,600
我feel唔feel到

149
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
我敢唔感覺到

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,800
即係我敢唔感覺到有hope

151
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,400
我敢唔感覺到有人愛我

152
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,400
感覺都重要

153
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,800
神造我哋係有感覺嘅

154
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,000
所以感覺 感受 情緒係重要嘅

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
但係喺經文呢度

156
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,400
保羅去鼓勵呢班人嘅時候

157
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
佢係話佢係讚嘅唔係淨係佢哋feel到呢啲嘢

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
而係呢啲嘅事情佢哋知道咗

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,200
係inspire佢哋去有回應

160
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,600
嗱 頭先讀咗啦

161
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
有work

162
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,200
有endurance 有labour

163
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,800
你有冇發現全部都係做

164
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,600
係要做

165
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,800
呢個信仰係要做

166
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,800
因為我哋嘅感受好易呃我哋

167
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,800
即係我哋都

168
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,400
即係舉個簡單嘅例子

169
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,600
例如以前我大學嘅時候

170
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
即係有時同啲friend

171
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
你倒數通宵

172
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
你好開心㗎嘛

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
跟住你真係會飲好多酒

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
我冇飲醉酒㗎

175
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,800
要聲揚飲好多酒

176
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
我冇飲醉酒

177
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,600
嗱 都會飲嘅

178
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,200
即係大學嘅時候

179
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,800
我講緊大學嘅時候

180
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,600
其實可能嗰日你好開心㗎

181
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
但係你到到第二日

182
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,200
你就會有所謂嘅monday blue

183
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
即係你會覺得

184
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,600
即係有生理反應

185
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,400
都會覺得

186
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,200
好似好開心嘅感覺就冇咗

187
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,600
所以感覺係容易呃我哋

188
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,200
所以保羅呢度唔係強調

189
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,400
話我feel到呢啲嘢

190
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,200
佢唔係淨係話呢班嘅christian

191
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,400
佢哋feel嗰樣嘢

192
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,200
而係佢哋有produce嘅

193
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,600
佢哋會inspire佢哋去做呢啲嘢

194
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
嗱 舉一個減肥嘅例子

195
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,600
在座有冇人減過肥呀

196
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
係 我知我知

197
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,000
我知我仲有成功例子嘅

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,600
我仲有一個

199
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,200
我可以搵次請佢上嚟講呢個減肥見證

200
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,400
不過今日係講我嗰個先啦

201
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,800
搵次講你嗰個啦 搵次講

202
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
嗱 如果你減過肥呢

203
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,200
有一個term叫做平台期

204
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,000
即係一個snaggleting period

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,400
有冇人解釋到呢個係咩嚟㗎

206
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
平台期咩意思 有冇人知道

207
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,800
係啦 點解都減唔到

208
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
即係一開始呢係會減得好快嘅

209
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
即係你改變咁啲習慣啦

210
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,200
你做好多嘅運動啦咁樣

211
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
但係去到某個位呢

212
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
係snaggleting period啦

213
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
即係你會停咗喺度

214
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
嗱嗰下你會有個掙扎就係

215
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,800
我做唔做落去呢

216
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,400
即係一個禮拜你都堅持到啦

217
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
兩個禮拜都得啦

218
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
如果一個月呢

219
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,200
兩個月呢

220
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
三個月呢

221
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,400
一年就少啲嘅

222
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,600
我未聽過一年都sag你地

223
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,400
我未聽過嘅

224
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,800
但係 但係舉返我自己嘅例子

225
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,600
呢個我兩年前講見證講我嘅

226
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
但係既然有好多新嘅人呢

227
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
我估講多次都ok嘅

228
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,200
嗱 嚴格嚟講

229
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,600
而家我介乎兩者中間啦

230
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,200
但係喺當時呢

231
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,400
係啦 左邊嗰個呢係減肥前啦

232
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,000
即係你見到塊面起碼完過而家呢個面啦咁樣

233
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,400
嗱嗰陣我減肥

234
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,800
咁都係好傳統嘅方法

235
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
就係你做運動啦

236
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,600
即係跑步啦

237
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
所以我梗係有跑馬拉松啦

238
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
跑步啦

239
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,800
同埋你絕食啦

240
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,400
yeah

241
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
yeah

242
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
好 係啦 我有跑馬拉松嘅 係啦

243
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,000
咁

244
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,200
你減到某個位呢

245
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,400
嗰陣係對我嚟講呢個stagnating period

246
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,200
係三個月左右

247
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,400
嗱係咩感覺呢

248
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,000
你每日企喺個磅度

249
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,800
你跑咗成日嘅步

250
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,200
你餓咗自己好耐

251
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,400
即係自己唔食嘢啦

252
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,000
跟住企咗上磅

253
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
仲沖咗尋油

254
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,200
一日係咁啦

255
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
兩日係咁啦

256
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
一個月 兩個月係咁嘅時候

257
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
你真係會好想放棄

258
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,000
你覺得 唉算啦 都減唔到㗎啦 扯咁

259
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,400
即係放棄呢就好辛苦啦

260
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
嗱 當然啦 科學嘅解釋

261
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,600
我特登搵返個科學嘅解釋呢

262
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
原來佢係話啲脂肪無咗嘅時候呢

263
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
你身體係會有啲水份喺度

264
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,600
即係你啲水份會頂咗個位置呢

265
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,200
所以你體係冇減到

266
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,000
但係你嘅身形係有改善

267
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,400
但係身形嘅改善呢

268
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,200
往往係好難睇到

269
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
因為例如咁嘅身形啦

270
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
其實你最容易減就係個body啦

271
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,400
到最後先係嗰塊面

272
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
即係換言之除非你唔著衫出街啦

273
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,800
如果唔係人哋睇唔到你減咗㗎嘛

274
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,200
嗱 有時信仰都幾似咁樣嘅經歷

275
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,400
嗱我哋會相信

276
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,800
即係嗰陣嘅堅持嘅最重要原因係乜呢

277
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,200
因為我哋都會睇好多減肥嘅書呀

278
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
即係正確嘅減肥知識

279
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,800
即係你知道呢件事要等嘅嘛

280
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,800
咁你會相信有一日會等到嗰個end

281
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
即係好似你Blood Cider會日登日

282
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,400
你登日到Day 15你會有你想要嘅嘢

283
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,000
但係有時我哋對聖經又唔係咁諗

284
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,800
即係除非我哋唔信聖經啦

285
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,000
如果唔係我哋相信聖經講嗰個Faith

286
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,200
Love同埋Hope

287
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,000
係一個我哋將來會得到嘅嘢嘅時候

288
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,600
我哋今日可唔可以喺嗰個Step Nading Period

289
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
如果你真係喺呢個period嘅話

290
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,000
我可唔可以堅持到落去呢

291
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,800
大概冇感覺呢有好多原因嘅

292
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
我唔會話只係得一個原因

293
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,000
但係我相信其中一個好大嘅原因

294
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
係有時我哋係要先經歷嗰個Step Nading Period

295
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,200
我哋嘅人要去到適應

296
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
然後先可以得到嗰個改變

297
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,800
所以保羅話Faith Love同埋Hope

298
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,000
去Inspire我哋做嘅嘢

299
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,400
其實講出嚟嗰啲嘢都係服侍其他人

300
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
即係工作勞苦忍耐

301
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,600
都係講緊服侍去愛其他嘅人

302
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
冇乜驚天動地方法

303
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,200
你要成功減到肥

304
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,400
唔係問我啦你問Preston啦

305
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,200
即係你冇乜驚天動地嘅方法

306
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,000
你唔會突然間食嗰隻藥就減

307
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
通常你會入醫院㗎咋

308
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,800
或者今日我哋嘅信仰我哋建立係乜嘢嘅上面呢

309
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
我哋係咪淨係想搵個感覺呢

310
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,600
我哋願唔願意去付出去體會呢

311
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
去體會嗰個信仰嘅核心嘅本質呢

312
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,200
第二句呢

313
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
第二句我就想大家

314
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,600
睇下先第二句

315
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,000
第二句呢我想大家一齊讀嘅

316
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
英文英文啦

317
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,600
好 3 2 1

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
You become intimidate of us and of the Lord

319
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,600
For you welcome the message in the midst of suffering

320
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,600
with the joy given by the Holy Spirit

321
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,600
And so you become a model to all the believers in Macedonia and Achaea

322
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,600
保羅喺講完佢哋去做嘅時候

323
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,600
佢就講咩呀

324
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
佢話你哋做嘅時候其實係模仿

325
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,600
我模仿其他嘅人

326
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
甚至佢哋成為咗人哋嘅model

327
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
我哋細個嘅時候我哋會用我哋嘅父母啦

328
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,600
我哋一啲大哥哥大姐姐做我哋嘅model啦

329
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,600
我問下先

330
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,600
在座有幾多人而家係仍然視你父母為你好想去學嘅model呀

331
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
在座

332
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,600
嘩好少手好驚呀呢句有啲驚呢

333
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
放心我哋唔會同家長講呀

334
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
請Manta唔好同家長講呀

335
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,600
請Manta不要同家長講呢個問題嘅答案

336
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
因為我自己都經歷過嘅

337
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,600
大概我到而家比較老嘅年紀啦

338
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,600
我先開始明白我父母當年好多嘅諗法做法嗰啲嘢

339
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,600
唔代表我完全認同但起碼會明白啦

340
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,600
但呢個階段其實我哋鍾意跟嘅model呢

341
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
大概係呢一種model

342
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,600
即係我諗你哋熟Kpop多過我嘅

343
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
所以我就唔會獻醜嘅

344
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
我都會聽日本嗰啲歌啦

345
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,600
可能嗰啲係我哋鍾意嘅model

346
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
即係今日我哋講到model嘅時候

347
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
我哋腦入面就係諗呢一啲嘅model

348
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,600
即係點解佢哋叫model呢

349
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
因為佢哋靚仔囉

350
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,600
佢哋唱歌叻囉

351
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
佢哋跳舞靚囉

352
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
或者成個team啦

353
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,600
例如BTS成個team好型呀咁樣

354
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,600
即係好型呀好charm呀咁樣

355
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,600
你覺得信仰嘅model係點呀

356
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
呢個係我哋識嘅model啦

357
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
你覺得信仰嘅model係點呀

358
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,600
可能你冇諗過呀

359
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,600
因為由細到大返教會我見到嘅就係我爸

360
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
但係如果我哋好誠實地講呢一刻

361
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
我哋開始覺得我哋想學嘅唔係我哋父母

362
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,600
想學其他人嘅時候

363
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,600
咁學邊個呢

364
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,600
對保羅嚟講佢講呢一個嘅model呢

365
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
其實係會死嘅呢個model

366
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,600
頭先你話跟嗰啲idol啦

367
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,600
當年其實如果你有睇Netflix

368
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,600
即係我推的孩子

369
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
其實我唔記得

370
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
我即係講有呢啲嘢存在

371
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
但係我冇叫你睇呀

372
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,600
我哋知道嗰啲model嘅背後

373
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,600
其實有好多嘅辛酸甚至黑暗嘅內容喺裏面

374
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,600
所以model本身都唔一定就係嗰啲好靚嘅嘢

375
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
正如信耶穌

376
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
頭先我講faith hope同埋love係咪

377
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,600
但信仰呢個model喺當時

378
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
係會有呢啲咁嘅事情

379
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
點解呢

380
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
因為經文裏面其實頭先有讀啦大家

381
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,600
佢話個model係我哋喺患難裏面懷住聖靈所賜嘅喜樂

382
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
你發現有患難

383
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,600
當時嘅社會有好多誤解

384
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,600
即係我諗陣間都會講

385
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,600
今日都有對基督徒好多嘅誤解或者唔明白

386
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
舉個例子呀

387
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
即係今日我哋有聖餐

388
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
係咪

389
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
但當時嘅文化裏面

390
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
你估羅馬人點諗呢樣嘢呢

391
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,600
佢哋會諗話你班基督徒係話食耶穌嘅血

392
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
耶穌嘅肉

393
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
即係我哋聖餐嘅意義

394
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
啱啱洗咗禮嘅人應該答到

395
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
個代表啲咩

396
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
跟住羅馬人會諗咩呢

397
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
佢哋會話你班人食人肉

398
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
飲人血呀喺度

399
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
我只估一個例子

400
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
即係你想像今日你咁樣當然即刻畀人拉啦

401
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
你今日咁樣就會

402
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
所以你會覺得係啦

403
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
咁所以

404
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
佢哋係好多呢啲誤解

405
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,600
即係甚至佢哋覺得呢班人好奇怪

406
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,600
做埋啲嘢好唔合群

407
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
唔可以feel咁多

408
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,600
咁所以佢哋係會死嘅

409
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
呢個有啲黑天鵬你睇側邊

410
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
基督徒係會死嘅

411
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,600
所以如果你話做基督徒呢

412
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
即係今日你坐喺度好舒服呢

413
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,600
咁可能有啲問題嘅

414
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,600
因為大概奧比安神主要係要有一個警告標誌

415
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
你可以選擇唔跟

416
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
所以你今日信咗咪呢

417
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
我今日唔信㗎

418
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
即係你可以話咁驚呀唔信呀

419
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
當你出到去呢個教會嘅門口

420
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
今日我哋面對好多嘅label

421
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
我唔知你朋友

422
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
即係我哋香港就會好啲

423
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,600
即係好多人就覺得我哋信耶穌幾好

424
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,600
但係我諗就算係我哋嘅學校

425
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
我哋嘅職場

426
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,600
我哋嘅朋友圈

427
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
我諗我哋開始會感受到

428
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
原來我哋有啲價值觀係唔match

429
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
貼啲label喺你身上

430
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,600
貼啲label喺你身上

431
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
陣間會講少少label嘅嘢

432
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,600
最後一個point

433
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
但係你會點label自己身份呢

434
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
你今日會點label呢

435
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,600
人哋點label我哋呢

436
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,600
人哋點label我哋呢

437
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,600
人哋點label我哋呢

438
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,600
去到最後呢

439
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
保羅佢

440
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
喺呢本書呢個開頭部分嚟嘅

441
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,600
其實佢講咗呢啲好清楚話係呀信就有咁得人驚

442
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,600
其實佢講咗呢啲好清楚話係呀信就有咁得人驚

443
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,600
或者咁容易嘅事情

444
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
但係佢仍然覺得呢班人

445
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,600
能夠去

446
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,600
佢欣賞呢班嘅信徒係佢知道好困難

447
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
但佢仍然去選擇去相信

448
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
但佢仍然去選擇去相信

449
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
好 咁呢個係今日最後一節經文

450
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
我想請Andrew幫我去讀

451
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,600
貼索萊尼加前書一章九節

452
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
貼索萊尼加前書一章九節

453
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,600
喂喂喂

454
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
喂喂喂

455
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
For they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us

456
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
For they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us

457
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
They tell how you turn to God from idols to serve the living and true God

458
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,600
They tell how you turn to God from idols to serve the living and true God

459
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
多謝Andrew

460
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
They tell how you turn to God from idols

461
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
They tell how you turn to God from idols

462
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,600
信仰係要我哋去turn

463
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,600
信仰係要我哋去turn

464
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
信仰係要我哋去turn

465
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,600
要我哋去改變

466
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
頭先做嘅嘢其實到最後係

467
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
因為我願意改變我個allegiance

468
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,600
我今日跟邊一個呢

469
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,600
我跟其他人鍾意嘅觀念

470
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,600
定係我跟耶穌呢

471
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,600
今日嘅idol呢

472
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
就唔係當年嘅idol

473
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
真係有個偶像起咗喺度啦

474
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,600
同埋有好多唔道德嘅行為嘅

475
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
佢哋有好多唔道德嘅行為

476
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
即係你會飲醉酒啦

477
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
甚至會有好多

478
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,600
即係我哋所謂好混亂嘅男女關係

479
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,600
即係個宗教入面

480
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,600
即係當時嘅羅馬宗教好多呢啲情況

481
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,600
但係今日我哋唔會咁explicit

482
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
今日嘅idol呢

483
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
我覺得係比較implicit

484
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
甚至睇落去好中性

485
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,600
有幾多人覺得上天堂係可以

486
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
最開心係24/7對住部手機

487
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,600
有人舉手

488
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
我欣賞Alias好誠實

489
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,600
我欣賞你好誠實

490
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,600
我估計天堂

491
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,600
我唔知道天堂有冇手機

492
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,600
但如果頭先講

493
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
turn to god from idols嘅話

494
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
我哋點理解idol

495
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,600
就係嗰啲阻住我哋turn to god嘅嘢

496
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
所以今日

497
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
其實今日嘅idol係更加implicit

498
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
因為好多嘢唔係

499
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
明明我叫你去飲醉酒

500
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
你都唔係咁做

501
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
但我叫你玩手機

502
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
你唔會覺得有問題

503
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,600
但我唔想去label呢一樣嘢

504
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
因為今日有更加多嘅事情

505
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
其實係我哋嘅idol

506
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
可能係我哋嘅學業

507
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
讀書係我哋嘅本份

508
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,600
但係如果我將佢變成一個idol嘅時候

509
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,600
佢就阻礙我哋turn to god

510
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,600
如果我哋再

511
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
我知道college嗰啲人開始係啱啱入緊職場

512
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
一段時間

513
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
可能你開始發現工作嘅上面

514
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
有好多係legal

515
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,600
但唔一定moral嘅事情

516
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
咁我做唔做呢

517
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,600
又或者再直接啲

518
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
例如當我哋嘅學校

519
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
自己喺度

520
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
LGBTQ+

521
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
但係就好長

522
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
其實我背唔哂

523
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
當佢覺得我哋要去包容嘅時候

524
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
跟住我哋話我哋個信仰未必好同意

525
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,600
咁人哋會label啲乜嘢

526
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
有冇人諗到你label嘢

527
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
你label啲乜嘢

528
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
或者你被人label過

529
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
exclusive

530
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,600
intolerant

531
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,600
harsh

532
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,600
not loving

533
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,600
呢啲就係嗰啲label

534
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
所以今日

535
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,600
我哋

536
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,600
信咗未

537
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,600
我哋點樣有智慧感

538
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
我唔認同你

539
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
但係我都話佢愛你嘅時候

540
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,600
我會話佢愛你

541
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,600
而當我畀人label嘅時候

542
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
我點樣反應呢

543
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,600
信仰可以講好多嘢

544
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,600
可以好複雜

545
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,600
但今日想講嘅嘢係

546
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
信仰都可以好簡單

547
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
呢三樣嘢其實都係做

548
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
都係要做出嚟

549
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,600
我唔係去到辯論

550
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,600
個邏輯合唔合理

551
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
寶來都唔係想同嗰啲信徒辯論

552
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
話神有好多

553
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
revelation

554
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
我直接話

555
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,600
佢地turn to god from idol

556
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,600
佢地就有嗰個behavior

557
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,600
希望新嘅一年

558
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
我哋有屬於自己嘅決擇

559
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,600
我願意向邊個

560
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
say yes

561
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
to whom do i put my

562
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
allegiance

563
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
我嘅忠誠我願意跟隨邊一個呢

564
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
我想跟耶穌

565
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,600
定跟呢個世界呢

566
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
我邀請大家

567
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
有一分鐘安靜嘅時間

568
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,600
我邀請大家一齊低頭

569
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,600
我諗特別今日第一次去

570
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,600
參加我哋explorer嘅

571
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Junior Boys and Girls

572
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
我都邀請你

573
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,600
當你離開兒童區你進入咗呢個群體裏面

574
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
今日

575
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
你信咗未呢

576
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
今日你想跟邊個呢

577
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,600
對於我哋已經喺度

578
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,600
三年五年

579
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
甚至唔知有冇十年嘅人

580
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,600
to whom do you say yes

581
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:48,600
我第一題係祈禱

582
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,600
七天嘅主感謝你

583
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,600
因為你選擇咗我哋

584
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
你揀選呼召咗我哋

585
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
而至今日我哋有呢一個

586
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,600
能夠turn to you嘅機會

587
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
但係主要我哋知道呢個信仰

588
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,600
有時會有好多嘅挫折

589
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,600
有時會好悶

590
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,600
有時讀經靈修好悶

591
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
祈禱好悶

592
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
對空氣講嘢咁樣

593
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
喺呢個時間裏面求你幫助我哋

594
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
讓我哋有你所畀我哋嘅信心

595
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,600
而至今日我哋面對好多嘅困難

596
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
我哋仍然能夠去選擇跟隨你

597
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,600
我哋唔一定已經預備好

598
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
我哋有時仍然會失敗

599
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
仍然會想離開嘅時候

600
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,600
但當我哋立志向你say yes嘅時候

601
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
願主你就去幫助我哋嘅信心

602
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
堅固我哋嘅信心

603
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,600
願主你咁樣祝福我哋每個explorer

604
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
以上有禱告、祈求

605
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,600
奉主耶穌基督的聖名而求
