[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   The farmer who obeyed God.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Johnny told us last week about Gideon the farmer and his transition from doubter to believer
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   and from believer to warrior.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   And tonight we will see his victory.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   A victory against all odds.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Now you might be able to identify with that at the moment.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   We all feel like that at the moment that we are battling against the odds.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   That the odds are stacked up against us.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Now many people have had to do what we call downsizing.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   And basically downsizing is to do more with less.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Some people have lost their jobs.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Some people are not able to get to appointments, not able to make sales.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Some people are really struggling at the moment.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I believe that sometimes God trims our resources in order for us to depend on him.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Sickness, financial reversal, family conflict and other difficulties can cause us to turn our lives to God.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   But we need to remember this, that when the odds seem overwhelming, God overwhelms the odds.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I'll say that again.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   When the odds seem overwhelming, God overwhelms the odds.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   But when it comes to war, nations don't usually downsize.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   They usually do the opposite.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   They mobilise their reserves.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   They cancel all leave and requests for discharge and retirement.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   They need every man they can get.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And as we continue to look at Gideon, we see in Judges chapter 7,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   that God is going to ask him to do something which to many nations would seem crazy.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Now remember, the Gideon's army was already hugely outnumbered.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Judges 8.10 tells us that the Midianite army was 135,000 strong.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   While Gideon's force numbered a mere 32,000 according to Judges 7.3.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   One Israelite for every four Midianites.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Now I don't know about you, but Gideon must have thought,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   "We've got no chance against an army that size."
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   But Gideon at least understood the might of his enemy.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I think for us sometimes you see we are oblivious to the forces around us
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   that try to snare us and defeat us.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And so we must recognise that we're engaged in spiritual warfare daily.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   We're battling the world.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   We're battling with flesh, battling the devil and his agents.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Can I go back to Gideon?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   To guarantee that history would record this battle as a divine victory.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I mean so much so that we're still talking about it tonight, 3,000 years later.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   God issued an order for a massive reduction in force.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Let's look at it.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The Lord said to Gideon, "You have too many men."
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I cannot deliver Midian into their hands or Israel would boast against me.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   My own strength has saved me.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Now announced to the army, anyone who trembles with fear
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   So 22,000 men left while 10,000 remained.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So 32,000 had become 10,000.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   But, and it's a very big but, let's read on.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   The Lord said to Gideon, "There are still too many men.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Take them down to the water and I shall thin them out there for you.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   If I say this one shall go with you, he shall go.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   But if I say this one shall not go with you, he shall not go."
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So Gideon took the men down to the water.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   There, the Lord told him, "Separate those who lap the water with their tongues
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   as a dog laps from those who kneel down to drink."
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   300 of them drank from cupped hands, lapping like dogs.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   All the rest got on their knees to drink.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   The Lord said to Gideon, "With the 300 men that lapped,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I will save you and the Midianites into your hands.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Let all the others go home."
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So Gideon sent the rest of the Israelites home
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   and he kept the 300 who took over the provisions and the trumpets of the others.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Let's have a look what happened.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   We went from 32,000 to 10,000.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   If that was not bad enough, we then went from 10,000 to just 300.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Can you imagine what's going through Gideon's mind right now?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   He's probably thinking, "God, we had a very slim chance of winning with 32,000 men.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   But now you want us to fight with 300 against 135,000 Midianites."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I thought of putting this into a Hong Kong context.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Can you imagine you're on Central Station about six o'clock in the evening?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   You've just got off your train from Tsim Sha Tsui
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   and people are coming down the entrance.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   And instead of going through the exit one,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   you go the same way as the 450 people are coming down.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   That was what it was like for Gideon.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   He was like on the MTR escalator going up the way that everybody was coming down.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Gideon was left with a mere 300 troops.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And his only option was to trust God, to trust God or perish.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   And so he was left virtually without an army.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   But remember this,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   when we are serving in God's army, we become part of the overwhelming majority.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Can I say it again?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   When we are serving in God's army, we become part of the overwhelming majority.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And just because we're in the minority,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   it doesn't mean it's all bad.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Because with God, it's never about numbers.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's about faith.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And that's why if everyone here at KFCI,
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   as small as we are in numbers,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   if each of us would just trust God,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   then He will always provide for victory in our lives.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   As someone once said,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   "You cannot be too small for God to use,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   but you can be too big."
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Can I repeat that?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   You cannot be too small for God to use,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   but you can be too big.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Too big.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   In other words,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   if you want credit for what God is doing in you,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   God will not use you.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   That's why when you look around,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   you will see God working in a powerful way
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   in the lives of some very weak people.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   They are Christians who are called to give God the glory.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   It begs a question for us.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Do we bask in our victory?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Or do we praise God for His work in our lives?
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Now, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   you can only imagine Gideon's state of mind.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   The odds weren't very good to begin with.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   And now they had gotten even worse.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   And so aware of Gideon's weak faith,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   God reassures him, and you'll love this story,
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   by arranging for Gideon to overhear a conversation
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   between two enemy soldiers.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Look at the verse I've put on the screen.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Gideon listens in as two Midianite soldiers
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   discuss a strange dream.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Now remember in ancient times,
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   dreams were highly regarded
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   as a means of predicting future events.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And so in the dream,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   a hard loaf of barley bread
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   rolls into the Midianite camp
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   and flattens one of the tent.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   They conclude that the loaf represents Israel.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Because remember from John's sermon last week,
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   the Midianites had plundered Israel
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   and stolen their wheat harvest.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   And so the impoverished Jews had to resort to barley bread.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Barley bread was regarded at the time
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   as a poor man's alternative to wheat.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And the tent could only represent
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   the nomadic, the wandering Midianites.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   It leads one of the soldiers to cry out
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   with an awful realisation in Judges 7.14,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   "This can be nothing other than the sword of Gideon,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   son of Joash the Israelite.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   God has given the Midianites
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   and the whole camp into his hands."
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Now remember, Gideon was a farmer.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   And like we saw last time,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   he asked for a lot of signs from God
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   because he needed a lot of reassurance from God.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   And so this isn't a spot of luck for Gideon.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   This was not by chance.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   This was his sovereign God
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   giving him another sign of his own.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Think about it.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Think about it.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   God protected Gideon
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   during his trip into enemy territory.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   God led Gideon to one specific tent
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   and God timed Gideon's arrival
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   to hear about a dream and its interpretation.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   And look at what happened to Gideon's faith.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   After he heard those men say those things.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Verse 15.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Gideon's fears and doubts had been overcome
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   and now he is mentally prepared for the combat.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Don't you just love to read about the growth of Gideon?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   We see that he went from being a man
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   trembling in a wine press
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   to a confident general
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   ready to lead his outnumbered troops into battle.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And make no mistake about it.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Gideon wasn't Winston Churchill.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   He was a farmer.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   He was an unconventional leader by secular standards.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   But once again, we see God's strength being revealed
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   by enabling what we would call a weak man to triumph.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Gideon was being modest
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   because he knew that he lacked the resources to overcome
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   and he had to rely on God.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I don't know about you,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   but there's times in my life
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   when I felt like that.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   When I realized I just couldn't do something
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   or get through something on my own strength.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   What the world does, it sells us self-help books
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   and motivational talks
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   that will help us to believe in ourselves
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   in order for us to become more self-reliant.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   But God strips us bare.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   He forces us to recognize our frailties
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   and our inadequacies.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   God shows us that human resources
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   are insufficient for the battles we face.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And it is God who teaches us the lesson of dependence,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   which results in confidence.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Now the apostle Paul understood this
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   when he said in Philippians 4.13,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   you know the verse,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   "I can do all things through him who gives me strength."
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   And so with God's power,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Gideon was able to do all things
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   and Gideon was able to boldly go into battle.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   He wasn't confident in his own abilities.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   He certainly wasn't confident in the 300.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Yes, 300 soldiers he had with him,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   but he went with the confidence
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   knowing that his God was right there with him.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   You're gonna love this next bit.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   I wanna take a look at the kind of ammunition
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   that Gideon was about to use in battle.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   Look at this verse.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Now we would expect to read that the 300 men
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   would have been armed with swords or bows and arrows.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   But a text said he assembled an army of 300.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   He then divides them into three companies,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   arming them with trumpets, empty clarges,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   or even clay jars and torches.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Now I don't know about you,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   but it sounds more like Gideon
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   was setting up a military band
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   or sending some personal suppliers into battle.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Now remember what the Lord told Gideon in Judges 6.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   We saw it last week.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   The Lord is with you, mighty warrior.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   The lowly farmer is about to become that mighty warrior.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   And Gideon has one thing at that time in his favour.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And it's this, the element of surprise.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And so he takes the lead
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   and he says to the 300 troops in Judges,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   verses 17 and 18,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   "Watch me, follow my lead.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   "When I get to the edge of the camp,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   "do exactly as I do.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   "When I and all who are with me blow our trumpets,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   "then from all around the camp, blow yours
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   "and shout for the Lord and for Gideon."
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And so at Gideon's command,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   they took positions outside the perimeter of the enemy camp.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Look at this next verse, which tells us what happens.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   We read that during the night,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   there was a sound of 300 jars being smashed on the ground.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   There was the blinding light of 300 torches piercing the darkness
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   and the thundering sound of 300 rams horns signaling attack.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   And with one voice, the Israelite army shouted
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   a blood-curdling battle cry,
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   "A sword for the Lord and for Gideon."
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   And what happened next?
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   The answer is panic stations for the Midianites.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Judges 7, 21 to 25 tells us that the Midianite army
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   imagined they were being attacked from all sides.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And because they were totally unprepared,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   this caused confusion and they quickly began attacking each other in the dark,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   not knowing whether it was a friend or a foe.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   The Jewish soldiers held their positions,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   staying a safe distance, socially distance from the deadly chaos before them.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   And that my friends is the story of Judges chapter 7.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   But I just need to summarize what is happening in Judges 8
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   because it's all part of Gideon's story.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   In the first 21 verses,
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   we see Gideon using the soldiers he had in reserve.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Remember, he had a very, very full substitutes bench, right?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   He sealed off the enemy escape route
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   and his troops go out and capture and kill two key enemy officers.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   In verses 22 to 23, we see that out of gratitude,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   the throne of Israel, the throne of Israel is offered to the deliverer.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Gideon is urged to become king.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   But to his credit, Gideon unselfishly declines the offer
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   to be crowned king of Israel.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Why? He says in verse 23, he said this to them,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   "The Lord will rule over you."
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Gideon knew that he was only an instrument of God
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   and Israel's real king was the Lord himself.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   In verses 24 to 32, it tells us that Gideon continued to serve as a judge
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   and live out his days in prosperity.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   And all he asked from his countrymen is a small portion of the captured gold.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   And even then he fashions it into an ephod,
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   which was a priestly garment used in worship.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   But what was supposed to be a symbol commemorating Israel's victory,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   regrettably became an object of worship.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And once again, note what happens after Gideon passes away
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   in verses 33 to 34, I'll read them to you.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   "No sooner had Gideon died than the Israelites
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   "again prostituted themselves to the Baals.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   "They set up Balbareth as their god,
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   "and they did not remember the Lord their God
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   "who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side."
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And so my friends, week after week, we've seen this.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   The cycle continues.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   They get involved in idolatry.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   They end up in a mess.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   They repent, they cry out to God for help.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   God sends them as a deliverer.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   God chooses that person to deliver them.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   And everything is great for a while.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   But as soon as the deliverer dies,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   it starts all over again.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   As we finish,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   let me ask,
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   who do we trust?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Who do you trust?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   When we are faced with impossible odds,
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   do we fall apart?
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Or do we fall on our knees in prayer,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   trusting the Lord of hosts?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   And let me just say,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   it is really difficult, if not impossible,
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   to have faith in someone you don't know or barely know.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   It's extremely hard to trust someone that you misunderstand
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   or are misinformed about.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   What we learned from Gideon is this.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Gideon's ignorance about the Word of God
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   was a strong factor in his ability or his inability to trust God.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   He totally misunderstood the very nature,
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   the very character of God.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And that's why for us Christians,
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   knowing God and knowing His Word
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   through personal Bible studies,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   through clans are so important.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Because if we do not live the Word of God in our lives,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   we will show the same unbelief
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   and same stubbornness to believe that Gideon had.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   So let me encourage you
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   to allow God to use you
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   as He used Gideon,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   allowing Him to do great things through you.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Read your Bible.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Study your Bible.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Learn and grow from your Bible.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Join a clan.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Follow those who are demonstrating the example of Christ in their lives.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Gideon was a lonely farmer,
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   but with the Lord's help,
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   he became a mighty warrior.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   The question is,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   will you finally obey God
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   and allow Him to use you
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   and help you become the kind of Christian
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   that He dearly desires for you to become?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Let's pray together.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   As a learner of commitment,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I just want to commit this time to God.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   I just want to commit this time to Him
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   and ask you to surrender all you have to Him.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Lord, would you take me as weak as I am
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   and would you use me?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Lord, help me get to know you better
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   and help me, Lord, to allow you
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   to have your way in my life
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   and to use me
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   in Jesus' name.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   I believe that God is going to use people from this church
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   in extraordinary ways,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   in ways that you couldn't even imagine.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Just put yourselves into His hands.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Now, to help us,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   I've set some study questions.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   I'm going to put them on the screen.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   We'll have them again at the end or you can get them online.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   And I want to take four things that I've said
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   and ask you a question about it.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   Number one, I said you cannot be too small for God to use,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   but you can be too big.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   My question is how would you feel
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   if you were like Gideon having his army reduced
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   from 32,000 to 300?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Can you think of a practical occasion
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   when you've had to face an equivalent challenge?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   Secondly, I said that God shows us that human resources
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   are insufficient for the battles we face.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Can you recall a time
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   when you've tried to meet a challenge on your resources alone?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And what happened when you decided to trust God instead?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   My third question was quite simple.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Who do we trust?
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   My question is this,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   when we're faced with impossible odds,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   do we fall apart or fall on our knees in prayer?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Do we fall apart or fall on our knees in prayer?
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Trusting the Lord.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   And lastly,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Gideon's ignorance about the Word of God
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   was a strong factor in his ability to trust God.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   And I want to ask you this question,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   what can I do this week and in the future
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   and to know His Word,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   how can I encourage others to do the same?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Let's join in singing this song,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   The Victory is Yours.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
