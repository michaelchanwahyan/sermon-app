[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.720]   Can you believe it's the middle of November,
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.400]   2020 is nearly gone and you go into the shops now
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.160]   and you see Christmas decorations, things to buy.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.280]   During Christmas time I particularly think
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.800]   a lot about England.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.520]   There's much more of an English Christmas vibe,
[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.840]   well there's a lot more of a Christmas vibe going on
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.660]   in England.
[00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.040]   Hong Kong just has lots of nice big trees
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.480]   and decorations inside the malls, right.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.660]   But when I'm thinking about England and the Christmas,
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.520]   I think the Christmas we had before we came to Hong Kong,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.840]   we went to a place called Litchfield Cathedral
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.160]   to watch the snowman, an orchestral performance
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.000]   of the snowman.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.680]   It was a wonderful time, it just makes me think,
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.360]   oh, just Christmas is so nice.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.880]   But as I was thinking about the different,
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.740]   actually England is full of big, beautiful churches.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.240]   I don't know if you've been to England
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.280]   and you'll see all these huge cathedrals
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.320]   and these are just such beautiful pieces of architecture.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.200]   And as I was preparing this message here,
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.180]   there was one that really popped into my mind.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.200]   And when I went to study in the University of Leeds,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.720]   there was one near the main entrance of the university,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.620]   near the Parkinson building.
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.240]   And it was again, a beautiful building
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.240]   and they're everywhere, even in the small villages
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.600]   and towns and cities.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.120]   And I walked past it and then you know what the name
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.520]   of this church building was, what was outside?
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.880]   A nice big sign, the name of the church was,
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.120]   not St. Peter's, not St. Andrew's, it was Halo.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.440]   And I'm like, oh, that's an interesting name for a church.
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.400]   I mean, I guess it's kind of religious,
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.240]   but that's a bit weird.
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.400]   And it turns out this wasn't really a church anymore.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.480]   It was supposed to be a church,
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.080]   it was a church at the beginning,
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.800]   but now it was a nightclub.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.620]   That had appropriately called themselves Halo.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.040]   I guess if I was an unbeliever and I'd acquired
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.040]   a church building to run my nightclub,
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.440]   Halo is a pretty cool name.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.520]   And then it made me think, there are so,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.680]   and those of you from England will know,
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.480]   there are so, so many churches, church buildings,
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.480]   sorry, in England, that are no longer housing churches,
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.160]   but they are housing nightclubs and community centres
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.440]   and all these different things.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.160]   And as I was looking at this passage today,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.760]   it really reminded me of that church building
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.280]   that is now called Halo.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480]   This idea that there's a church that was the body of Christ
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.240]   that had this reputation for being alive, but was now dead.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.360]   And as I read through this passage today,
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.120]   my prayer for all of us is as we read through this letter
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.800]   to the church in Sardis from Jesus Christ himself,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.440]   that we will take heed from some of the things
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.920]   that he tells this church,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.000]   because this church hit home into my heart.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.560]   I'd love to read it to you now first.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.200]   Revelation chapter three, verse one to six.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.600]   And to the angel of the church in Sardis,
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.680]   write the words of him who has the seven spirits of God
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.200]   and the seven stars.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.840]   I know your works.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.040]   You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.920]   Wake up and strengthen what remains and is about to die,
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.400]   for I have not found your works complete
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.200]   in the sight of my God.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.360]   Remember then what you have received and heard.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.640]   Keep it and repent.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.080]   If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.320]   and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.360]   Yet you still have a few names in Sardis,
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.240]   people who have not sold their garments
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.560]   and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.800]   The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.520]   and I will never blot his name out of the book of life.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.800]   I will confess his name before my father
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.840]   and before his angels.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.520]   He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.800]   to the churches.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.000]   This is the word of the Lord.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.720]   Actually, before I continue, can I pray for us?
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.880]   As we dissect and look at these verses here,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.240]   my prayer is that the Spirit of God
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.080]   will really be speaking into our hearts.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.160]   Let's just pray again.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.200]   God, as we were singing to you
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.240]   and as we were worshipping you,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.640]   that final song and those lyrics,
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.840]   just, "Yet not I, but Christ in me."
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.520]   And Jesus, I know that these words that you wrote
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.480]   to the church in Sardis are the words
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.480]   that you are speaking to us right now,
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.280]   both as a body and as individuals.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.000]   And so I pray that your Spirit will continue
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.840]   to speak into our hearts and that we won't just listen,
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.360]   thinking that this is for somebody else.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.320]   But Lord, that we know that this is from you,
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.520]   not me, from you to us, to all of us.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.360]   We thank you for this chance to go through this.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.960]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.560]   So Sardis was an interesting kind of city.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.240]   It was a former royal town.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.800]   It was found, it was in a valley,
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.000]   but it was at the top of a little steep spur in the valley.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.760]   And it was a very wealthy town.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.200]   It had a reputation for being a very wealthy town.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.000]   King, many kings had stayed there,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.480]   but it was also invaded by many different people.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.120]   But there's really not much else we know about this city.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.880]   Now, the other churches,
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.600]   out of the letters that Jesus writes,
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.080]   we know quite a bit of context.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.880]   With Sardis, we don't know much.
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.640]   The only thing we know about Sardis
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.760]   is that it was invaded quite a few times.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.360]   So it was captured by foreign nations.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.280]   And another is that within the church,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.160]   there wasn't really any false teaching.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.840]   There wasn't any false heresy like the other churches had.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.680]   And another thing was,
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.120]   they also didn't really have any persecution.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.360]   They were actually quite a comfortable church.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.120]   So these are some of the key factors
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.760]   as you look at this church in Sardis.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.160]   But what's interesting is,
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.160]   there's no false teaching, there's no persecution,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.920]   yet it is the most damning of them all
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.440]   in terms of the letter, in terms of the rebuke.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.760]   Jesus, we talked about the poo sandwich last time,
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.080]   where it's constructive feedback,
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.240]   where you have a bit of encouragement,
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.600]   then you have the really bad stuff,
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.520]   and then you have an encouragement
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.440]   just to finish at the end.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.280]   With Sardis, there is nothing.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.000]   It is just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.080]   And this is a church that we know really know nothing about.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.720]   So what that is really interesting
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.880]   as we look at this passage.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.880]   And it starts off, verse one.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.640]   "And to the angel of the church in Sardis write
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.680]   "the words of him who has the seven spirits of God
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.920]   "and the seven stars."
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.640]   That really here is referring to Jesus is the one who,
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.200]   and it is Jesus' spirit that is speaking.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.800]   It's the complete Holy Spirit
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.560]   is speaking to this church in Sardis.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.840]   It is practically the same as the other ones
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.160]   where it says the one who holds the stars,
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.760]   the one who holds the lampstands,
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.120]   who walks amongst the lampstands is saying here,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.360]   the Holy Spirit is speaking to this church.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   Jesus talked about this, John 16, eight.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.560]   "And the Holy Spirit will come into the world
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.120]   "and convict the world of sin and righteousness."
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.960]   The Holy Spirit is coming to this church
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.400]   and telling them what they are doing right and wrong.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.560]   And then it starts.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.760]   "I know your works."
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.200]   We've seen that before.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.680]   Jesus is saying, I know what you guys are doing.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.000]   You are good people.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.560]   You have good programs.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.320]   You have good outreach initiatives.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.480]   You are doing good stuff.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.400]   I know that you have works and I know what they are,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.400]   but you have the reputation of being alive,
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.560]   but you are dead.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.720]   And I wanted to share the four observations
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.960]   that I have with you first.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.640]   I'll list them all first so you know where we're going
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.400]   so you can track a little bit easier.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.160]   And the four observations I had
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.800]   from these six verses is this.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.920]   The first one is this.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.080]   Reputation is not reality.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:40.400]   Reputation is not reality.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.840]   Number two, remember what you have received.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.160]   That's what Jesus is telling them.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.920]   Number three, repent or be removed.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.880]   And finally, he does finish on a positive note.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.040]   Reward awaits the resilient.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.680]   So if you were to sum these six verses down,
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.040]   I know I'm not really doing much.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.440]   I'm just going from six down to four,
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.240]   but this is essentially what Jesus is saying.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.520]   And we'll start with the first one.
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.560]   Reputation is not reality.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.440]   And he says here, you have the reputation
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.440]   of being alive, verse one still, but you are dead.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:18.400]   Have you ever based some of your decisions on reputation
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.920]   and then been left disappointed?
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.240]   In England, this happens more if someone tells us,
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.280]   hey, there's a nice restaurant
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.280]   that you should go and try and eat.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.360]   It's got a good reputation.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.480]   And then you go and it's like, oh, it really wasn't that nice.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.920]   I should have gone to Nando's.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.560]   Right?
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.400]   'Cause Nando's isn't the best, but it's just safe.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.240]   But that's England.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.800]   In Hong Kong, most restaurants are quite nice.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.160]   Reputation, though, is not reality.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.440]   What Jesus is saying here is,
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.480]   you guys are known for being alive.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.000]   You guys are known for being righteous.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   But I can tell you that is not the reality.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.880]   People think that you're alive, but I know you are dead.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.040]   People see on the outside and think you're doing well,
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.000]   but I know on the inside, you are not doing well.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.160]   Now, can you just imagine if you were this,
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.280]   if you were in this congregation in Sardis,
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.840]   this former royal town, comfortable, no persecution,
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.200]   you're doing a decent job, it's a comfortable life,
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.640]   but you know that you're not alive.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.880]   You know you're just doing things just for the sake of it.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.600]   You know that's just how you've been doing.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.320]   But then Jesus himself tells you,
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.600]   I know you, I see through you.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.240]   Wouldn't that just send shivers down your spine?
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.000]   Jesus said this to the people that he saw,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.080]   Pharisees, Matthew 23, he says,
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.520]   you guys are busy cleaning on the outside of your cup,
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.200]   but the inside of your cup is dirty.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.880]   I ask that to myself.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.520]   How much do we, do I get engrossed with
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.000]   how I present myself to other people?
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.680]   What reputation I have?
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.080]   Reputation is so important here, right?
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.800]   Especially in a city like Hong Kong.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.400]   And yet Jesus is saying, your reputation is not reality.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.680]   And this is a question that all of us believers
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.960]   have to ask ourselves.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.480]   What are we like on the inside?
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.720]   Are we people of integrity?
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.280]   Where we are the same when we're on our own,
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.840]   and we're the same when we are around other people?
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:22.480]   Recognizing that Jesus sees straight through us,
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.920]   and us as the church.
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.320]   Well, first of all, we have to ask ourselves,
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.760]   what kind of reputation do we have?
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.960]   Right, it might not even be a good one.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.560]   This church had a good reputation, what about ours?
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:39.720]   Jesus desires for us to be known as people who follow him,
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.240]   as people who love one another, who strive for unity.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.920]   Do we have that reputation?
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.240]   Before we even think about reality,
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.720]   that's the first thing that we really have to go for.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.280]   And that starts with us as individuals.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.160]   So I ask you, brothers and sisters,
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.680]   how are you doing inside?
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.280]   On the outside, you guys look great, you really do.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.600]   And you're in church, so therefore reputation.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.080]   We know that you're believers, we know that you love God,
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.280]   but what about on the inside?
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.640]   What are you like on the inside?
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.960]   What am I like on the inside?
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.720]   Because it is so dangerous if we look clean on the outside,
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   but are dirty on the inside.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.320]   It is dangerous for us as believers to be operating in that
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.480]   because it's hypocritical.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.880]   It's dangerous for leaders, for church leaders,
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.720]   to be on that.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.040]   And actually, church leaders, recently we've seen,
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.240]   we are just humans.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.160]   And if we serve just on empty tanks,
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.400]   then we're just as bad as the rest.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   It's important for us to have reality checks
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.760]   on where we are at.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.160]   It's also dangerous because it actually causes,
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.200]   if we don't do a reality check on ourselves,
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.800]   we are prone to sleepwalking.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.120]   Sleepwalking, does anyone sleepwalk here?
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.680]   I used to sleepwalk, I used to sleepwalk,
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.880]   especially when I was a kid.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.600]   It's actually quite terrifying sleepwalking, right?
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.000]   Well, not for the person who's sleepwalking,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.120]   it's actually quite leisurely,
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.800]   but for the person, people who watch other people sleepwalk.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.600]   So growing up, my brother and I,
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.280]   we used to share a room together
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.400]   because he was scared of the dark.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.080]   He's still afraid of the dark right now.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.080]   So we had to share a room.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:22.080]   And there was one evening, my mum and dad saw me get up
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.240]   and run around the house looking for my brother.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.640]   And of course, in England, we have houses
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.680]   so we can actually run around.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.280]   You can't really run around in Hong Kong apartments.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.480]   So I was running around up and down the stairs,
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.120]   up and down the stairs, shouting, "Hey man, hey man."
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.240]   That's a Chinese name, He-Man.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.360]   "Hey man, hey man."
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.920]   And then my mum, having known that this had happened,
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.400]   we were prone to this, she would let me be,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.640]   'cause apparently you're supposed to let people be, right?
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.200]   Let them carry on sleepwalking.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.760]   So she'd try and gently prod me back to go into bed.
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.160]   But I'd keep running around the house.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.120]   And I can imagine this being really scary.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.760]   Another friend of mine sleepwalked as well.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.200]   I mean, we should have got together.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.280]   It would have been fun.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.000]   But he did something a lot more devastating.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.040]   He walked into his parents' room
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:12.040]   and then stood by his mum's bed, thought it was a toilet.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.960]   And then relieved himself and then went back to bed.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.120]   And so the mum's face would go, "What are you doing?"
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:23.960]   (screaming)
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.640]   Amazing, but anyway, I didn't do that.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:28.560]   I was just running around like a madman.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.640]   Of course, my brother was just in my room
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:31.920]   and he was right next to me,
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.440]   but I was just running around looking for him.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.640]   But I wonder how many of us
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.240]   actually are spiritually sleepwalking.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.440]   How many of us are running around in life
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.480]   looking for something?
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.840]   We know there's something inside us that is empty.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.080]   We know that we should be filling it with something,
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.880]   but we're just running around looking for it
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.440]   when all along it's been Jesus.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.280]   When all along he's been right there,
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.840]   but we are spiritually asleep.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.440]   We are sleepwalking.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   Are you spiritually asleep?
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.760]   Are you sleepwalking?
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.280]   Have you been in the faith for that long
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.320]   that actually you just don't remember when it first began?
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.840]   And actually you don't really care where it's going.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.960]   You kind of know where it's going.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.400]   You know you're supposed to be going to heaven
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.360]   at some point, but now you're just kind of wandering.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.920]   Spiritually sleepwalking.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   That's a dangerous place to be in.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:21.760]   That's a useless place to be in.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.320]   You see, the church of Sardis didn't deviate
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.600]   from sound teaching, but it was sound asleep.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.240]   And Jesus is saying, "Wake up."
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.880]   Sorry, some of you, I've actually just woken you up.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.240]   Wake, hi, I'm still here, sorry.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.080]   Wake up.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.600]   You are spiritually asleep.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.880]   Wake up.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.920]   You see, this church didn't have any false heresies.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.120]   But in some ways, actually a lot of commentators said
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.840]   that actually this church was content with being mediocre.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.880]   In fact, to actually even have false heresies
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.000]   at least assumes that you had an enthusiasm for truth,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.400]   that you were eager to learn something.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.440]   You were just being misled.
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.560]   This church didn't even have that, so they didn't even care.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.320]   So they didn't even have the enthusiasm
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.360]   to entertain heresies.
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.640]   Another thing is, they also didn't have any persecution.
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.280]   Why? Because their convictions weren't deep enough
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:20.000]   to be intolerant to the people outside.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.880]   So therefore, the people outside are like,
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.520]   "There's no point in persecuting that group.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.480]   "They are just a cozy, easy, lazy bunch of believers
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   "that basically make no impact in the world.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.520]   "Leave them alone."
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:34.480]   So this church was not in a good place.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.200]   It was spiritually asleep,
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.240]   which is akin to being spiritually dead.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.640]   And that's why Jesus says, "Wake up."
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.040]   Wake up.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.520]   It goes, verse two, "Wake up and strengthen what remains
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.280]   "and is about to die, for I have not found your works
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.520]   "complete in the sight of my God."
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.320]   You see, I preached a couple of weeks ago
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.960]   on the church of Ephesus that had lacked,
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.520]   that had abandoned the first love.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.480]   And Christina and I, we were in a Bible study today
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.600]   talking about amongst believers
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.320]   who'd believed for a long time,
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.480]   just talking about our first love,
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.640]   that they'd abandoned the first love.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:16.840]   So the church of Ephesus lacked love.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.200]   The church of Sardis lacked life.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.880]   Both are crucial.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.400]   The church of Ephesus had the head knowledge,
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.240]   but it had failed, it had stopped,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.240]   and didn't let it drop down into the heart.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.360]   The church of Sardis barely had the head knowledge, kind of,
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.760]   but didn't let it go into the heart
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.240]   and also didn't let it go into the limbs.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.040]   It didn't spur them to action.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.920]   So they were dead.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.480]   And Jesus is saying, "Wake up, wake up."
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.280]   This week, there was some big news
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.760]   that I believe really affected the financial markets.
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.520]   There was a company that announced
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.400]   that they had found the vaccine.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.720]   Pfizer announced that the vaccine is on its way,
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.600]   was fast-tracked, and it's 90% accurate, is that so?
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:10.920]   Let me know how it goes if anyone takes it.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.520]   As a biology teacher, I was thinking about,
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   I mean, 'cause we've been talking about vaccines
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.080]   for a long time, feels like we won't be able to fly,
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.440]   truly, until we have this vaccine.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.400]   But how do vaccinations work?
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:29.280]   Vaccinations work by injecting a weak or a dead version
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.760]   of said virus into your body,
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.480]   so that then your body,
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.520]   because it's only a weak or dead version,
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.840]   learns to tolerate it, learns to battle it,
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.120]   and learns to kill it, and it has the memory cells
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.080]   so then in the future, it'll have the antibodies,
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.200]   so when you do get exposed to the real thing,
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.920]   it now knows how to tackle it.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.480]   That's how a vaccination works.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.760]   Then I started to think,
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.400]   I wonder how many of us have injected ourselves
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.560]   with a weak or dead version of Christianity
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.960]   that stops us from experiencing the real thing.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.560]   How many of us think that we have Christianity,
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:07.600]   but it's actually just a weak or dead version?
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   Now, the problem with just having this weak or dead version
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.200]   is you cannot upgrade.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.640]   You cannot just say, "Oh, I'm gonna move from,"
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.240]   or you can, but not naturally from this path.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.040]   You have to get rid of the fake or the weak
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.800]   or the dead version of Christianity
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.520]   before you can truly experience the whole of it.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.000]   But how many of us here are blocked
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.960]   because we have a weak or dead version of the faith?
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.880]   That's a question that only you can ask yourself,
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.640]   and that's a question that only you can get answers from
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:36.960]   between you and God.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.680]   How many of us are spiritually dead,
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.360]   spiritually sleepwalking?
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.520]   Jesus is telling us,
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.240]   it doesn't matter what people think about you,
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.440]   whether people think you're still a Christian,
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.880]   whether people still think you're a leader,
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.560]   what matters is that I know
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.840]   that your reputation is not reality.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:00.040]   So wake up, oh sleeper, rise from the dead,
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.840]   and Christ will shine on you.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.760]   That is what Paul says to the church in Ephesus.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.280]   Clearly, it's a problem.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.960]   That is the first one, reputation is not reality.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.560]   And then it carries on at the end and it says,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:15.400]   oh, these key words here before I move on.
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.080]   For I have not found your works complete
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.520]   in the sight of my God.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.600]   I have not found your works complete.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.360]   When we see the word complete,
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.560]   whether it's downloading something on the computer
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.640]   or uploading or doing whatever, any kind of process,
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.280]   the word complete tells us whatever we wanted it to do,
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.640]   it is now done.
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.960]   It has fulfilled its purpose.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.520]   But Jesus is looking at this church inside
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.600]   and saying, you guys are doing lots of works,
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:44.000]   but God is saying that your works are not complete.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.520]   You are not doing what you're supposed to do.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.880]   You are sleepwalking, you are running around in circles,
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.760]   looking for something, but you'll never find it
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.320]   because you're sleepwalking.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.600]   So wake up, reputation is not reality.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.680]   Number two, remember what you have received.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.400]   Verse three, remember then what you received
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.680]   and heard, keep it and repent.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.520]   Remember what you received.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.480]   This is the same message as the church in Ephesus.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.040]   Remember how you got here.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.400]   Remember how you got into this church.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.120]   Remember your first love,
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.240]   why you are even here in the first place.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.880]   Remember that because what is the biggest problem
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:30.080]   in humanity, in us humans?
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.920]   Forgetfulness.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.800]   Because forgetfulness leads to ungratefulness.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.720]   Ungratefulness leads to ungodliness.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:44.680]   Because for us, if we forget how far away we were,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.440]   how blind we were, how broken we were,
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.440]   then we won't truly understand how much love
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.040]   he extends to us.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.120]   And we see this as we look in scripture all the time.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.760]   As we look in the Old Testament,
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.640]   we see the Israelites time and time and time again,
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.400]   forgetting, forgetting, forgetting.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.240]   They learn a little bit, they burn themselves,
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.680]   they remember, and then they forget.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.080]   And then they're just trapped in these vicious cycles
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:13.200]   of forgetfulness.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.920]   So Jesus is saying, remember what you heard.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.680]   Remember what you received.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.360]   That's why anniversaries are so important.
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.160]   That's why communion is so important for us as a body.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:29.360]   We're saying, together, Christ, we remember what you did.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:33.720]   We need each other to remember what Jesus did for us.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.360]   Remember what you have received.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.080]   That you are not sat here
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.880]   because you did something great yourself.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.240]   God did not choose to love you
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.840]   because he thought that you were
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.520]   particularly worthy of his love.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:50.120]   Everything that we have is because we received it
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.920]   through grace as a gift, and it was free.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.280]   And Jesus is saying, remember what you received.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.160]   That is incredibly important if we are then
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.840]   to do the next thing, which is repent.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.440]   Time and time again in these letters,
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.080]   Jesus says, repent.
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.960]   Not just change your mindset,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.400]   not just make a few amendments.
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.440]   Jesus is saying, do a U-turn,
[00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.640]   turn from your old ways and repent.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.480]   Or what?
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:25.280]   Repent or be removed.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.560]   Jesus in these letters is pretty harsh
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.360]   because each time he will just say, you repent,
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.200]   or in this one here in verse three,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.200]   repent if you will not wake up, I will come like a thief
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.120]   and you will not know at what hour I will come.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.520]   The first letter, Jesus says he'll remove that church
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.680]   from the lampstand, shut them down.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.520]   Here he says, I will come like a thief
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.680]   and you won't even know it hit you.
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.320]   This isn't the second coming though, by the way.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.520]   This isn't Jesus saying, I'm gonna come again
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.440]   because by that one, it doesn't matter
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.760]   whether we're awake or asleep.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.400]   Jesus is coming and we have no choice in the matter.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.360]   But this one, Jesus is saying, if you don't wake up,
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:14.360]   if you continue sleepwalking, I will shut you down.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.000]   Jesus is reminding this church,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.320]   church, you are the lampstand, but you're not the light.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.120]   I'm the light of the world.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.200]   The role of the church is to lift up the light.
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.360]   But if the lampstand isn't doing its job,
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.440]   Jesus is saying, I will remove that lampstand,
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.960]   I will shut you down.
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.720]   See, it sounds harsh, but you know,
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:36.320]   Jesus is giving this church
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.720]   and he's giving us a wake up call.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.760]   He's giving us a wake up call
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.880]   because we are sleeping, but in his grace
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.320]   and in his patience, he isn't shutting us down just yet.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.040]   And he's giving us a wake up call.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.920]   Now, 2020 has been the most terrible of years
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.600]   for most people, but from a spiritual sense,
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.440]   I am grateful for it because it provides us with what?
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.480]   A wake up call.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.960]   Have you received the wake up call from this year,
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.440]   from 2020, as God removes all the comforts
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.000]   and all the things and all the routines
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.080]   that you had put in place to keep your life comfortable?
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.160]   Have you heeded his wake up call?
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.920]   This wake up call is super important.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.560]   Actually, it's wake up calls that defined each moment
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:24.760]   in my life.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.920]   At 17, when my father passed away, boom, wake up call.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.280]   What are you doing here, James?
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.320]   What are you living for?
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.040]   At 23, I was in hospital for a month
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:36.880]   without eating anything.
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.640]   I came out incredibly skinny,
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.040]   just completely malnourished.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.720]   But I remember during that month
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.760]   that I was in the hospital,
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.800]   I was never closer to God in that time then.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.000]   Why?
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.840]   Because he was giving me a wake up call.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.520]   The things that you think that you are aiming for in life
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:55.160]   at that point, God's saying,
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.520]   "I could take it away just like that."
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:02.400]   But in my wisdom, in my love,
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   I'm allowing you to continue to live.
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.960]   So carry out your purpose.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.120]   Your work is not complete yet.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.280]   My next wake up call when I was 25, 'cause I got married.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.080]   That's a big wake up call, isn't it?
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.600]   27, when I have my first child.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.000]   29, when I have my second one.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   And then I'm in hospital again for another month.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.320]   It's as if I don't learn.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.760]   Because I'm forgetful.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.080]   Are you forgetful?
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.080]   Those moments in your life
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.520]   where you're super close to God,
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.280]   where you start doing the spiritual disciplines,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.320]   where you're doing all these things,
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.160]   and then slowly but surely, it just dwindles and forgets.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.080]   And Jesus says, "Wake up,
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:41.160]   "because I could come like a thief."
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:47.880]   And I want you to wake up, repent, or be removed.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.760]   Sardis, this church in Sardis would have known
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.160]   about this wake up call.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.840]   I mentioned that it was invaded a couple times.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.680]   In 500 BC and in 200 BC, it was invaded by enemy nations.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.520]   How?
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.080]   In the most peculiar way.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.880]   The enemy wanted to capture the city, the citadel.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.280]   And so it planned and strategized.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.760]   And at nighttime, they crept up to the citadel,
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.720]   and they realized the door was open.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.640]   And so they just walked in and took over the city
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.320]   while all its residents were sleeping.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.160]   This royal town that was relying on its reputation
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.480]   from the past was complacent.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.040]   And that was 500 BC.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.720]   And you'd have thought they'd learned.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.320]   But just a few hundred years later,
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:38.960]   the same thing happened again.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.000]   A group of 10 to 12 people went in, crept in,
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.720]   and the door was open again.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.000]   And this city that was comfortable
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.160]   but complacent was captured.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.120]   They were sleepwalking.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:59.800]   So Jesus, knowing that context, was telling them,
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.360]   you've been here before.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.400]   This is not a drill.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.160]   You know that this kind of stuff can happen.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.200]   In fact, in 17 AD, it does happen,
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.040]   but in a different way.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.080]   They had an earthquake, which completely you can't control,
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.840]   which decimated the whole town.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.000]   So they know things can happen.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   2020, fast forward to today,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.480]   we know that things can happen.
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.840]   We know that the plans that we make
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:23.040]   may not actually happen.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.760]   Proverbs 16, nine, that as we plan our steps,
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.920]   it is God who determines.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.840]   It is God who establishes them.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.320]   The book of James talks about this.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.760]   Let's not say where we're gonna go tomorrow
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.440]   as though we're in complete control.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.280]   We are not.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.400]   We are but vapors in the wind.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.320]   We could just disappear just like that.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.640]   But that's not to say that we live in fear all the time.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.600]   I had that.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.720]   Actually, after my dad died suddenly,
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.280]   I had that fear all the time.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.960]   Any moment, we could go.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.800]   That's it.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.920]   Any moment, we could go.
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.440]   Like, you could go, I could go.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.280]   Everyone's gonna die.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.560]   I had that mindset.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.760]   That's not to say that we need to hold that mindset
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.040]   because we also believe in a good God
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.720]   who is in complete control,
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.120]   that nothing happens without him saying yes.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.360]   What he does want us to do is to continue living today
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.040]   as though eternity is coming.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.960]   And that is our role,
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.920]   to point the people of this world
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.800]   into the kingdom of heaven,
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.880]   to point them and turn their eyes to Jesus.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.360]   That is why we exist.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.920]   That is why we live and breathe.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.160]   And if we don't do that,
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.960]   if we don't repent from following the old ways of the world,
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.080]   if we continue to conform to the passes of this world,
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.120]   Jesus is saying to his church, to us,
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.640]   you could be removed.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:49.400]   So for us, it requires us to do a reality check,
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.480]   to do an audit of our own lives.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.320]   Jesus says this,
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.280]   "Wake up and strengthen what remains,"
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.080]   'cause he knows that there is something there.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.640]   Just like I'm looking at you thinking
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.000]   there is something there inside you
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.640]   that if it can be activated,
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.720]   the body of Christ would be better for it.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.040]   God would be glorified in a better way.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.680]   Many of you know that Christine and I,
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.360]   we transitioned into another role.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.520]   We've been working with an organization called Young Life
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.360]   that goes into schools and universities
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.240]   to spread the gospel, to reach the unreached,
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.360]   to present them with the good news,
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.960]   because it is news to them.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.200]   And that is our main mission, and that's what we do.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.880]   But there's another group that really is on our hearts.
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.520]   It's preaching and sharing the good news
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.120]   to those within the church.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.800]   Because we recognize the church,
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.560]   the church, the bride of Christ,
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.120]   we're not in a necessarily healthy state,
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.040]   but we are sleeping, we are sleepwalking.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:49.520]   We have a reputation for being alive,
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.720]   but we're actually dead.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.640]   And so the onus is on all of us as individuals
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.360]   to do checks on ourselves.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.800]   Are we walking with God?
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.080]   Are we committed to completing works
[00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.120]   that are complete in the sight of God?
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.520]   So it's been pretty bad all the way until now,
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.000]   but there is a final nice point,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.680]   and the fourth point is this.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.840]   Reward awaits the resilient.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.600]   And it says this, verse four.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.720]   Yet you have still a few names in Silas,
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.000]   people who have not soiled their garments,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.640]   and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.200]   The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments,
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.240]   and I will never blot out his name out of the book of life.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.960]   I will confess his name before my father
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.080]   and before his angels.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.920]   That's the only bit of positive thing that is going on here.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:43.200]   There are some of you, a few of you in this city
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.800]   have not soiled your garments.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.520]   It's like a Chinese parent praising their kid.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.280]   He's like, I can't say that you're good
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.840]   because there's something about me, I can't say it,
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.520]   but all I'll say is, not bad.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.280]   That's all I can say.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.360]   You're not bad, (speaks in foreign language)
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:01.040]   that's all I can get out.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.800]   And in this church, almost Jesus is saying that,
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.000]   there's not that much good I can see,
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.760]   but all I'll say is, there's a few of you.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.520]   There's a few of you who haven't messed this up.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.080]   Now it's interesting because the other letters
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.280]   is often the majority are doing quite well.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.880]   You've kept to the good teaching,
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.360]   you're doing your good works,
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:23.280]   but there's a few of you who have strayed away.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.200]   This time it's flipped.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   The majority are asleep, but the minority are awake.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.760]   And I think that's this kind of place
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.080]   that we find ourselves in right now here in Hong Kong.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.160]   Do you recognize, do you know that we as believers here
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.320]   are the minority in this city?
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.160]   What's the percentage, John?
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:50.160]   I think it's 5% of Hong Kong are believers, 5%.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:57.320]   Doesn't that break your heart?
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.880]   That there are people outside
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.440]   who do not know what they were made for?
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.560]   There are people wandering the streets,
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.400]   toiling, working super hard,
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.320]   but they don't know what they're doing it for.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:20.320]   Doesn't that put more onus on us as the 5%
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.440]   to live out our faith,
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.560]   to not be sleepwalking at the very least?
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:30.440]   Because there is a whole majority out there
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.520]   that do not know God.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:39.680]   Yet a few of you remain who have not sold your garments.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.640]   And here Jesus gives the final encouragement.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.200]   The reward awaits the resilient,
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.680]   even though you are minority.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.280]   And I'm looking at you brothers and sisters,
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:52.960]   and I know that you are minority in your family.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.200]   I know that you are the minority in your workplace
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.040]   or in your universities or in your schools.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:00.920]   I know that you feel as though you are the minority
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.680]   and Jesus is here, is encouraging you.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.040]   Say, you may be the only believer in your family.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.480]   You may be the only Christian
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.800]   that's trying to uphold godly values in your workplace.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.320]   And He's saying, remain resilient.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.760]   Hold on, I see you.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.440]   I know you're there, I know what you're doing.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.080]   Keep fighting the good fight, keep running the race,
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.240]   because there is a reward that awaits you
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.960]   if you are resilient.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:32.480]   I think there's someone in this room tonight
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.960]   who needs to hear that even though you are the minority,
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.960]   that God is gonna use you massively.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.600]   Just like a little bit of salt can change
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.640]   how a whole piece of steak tastes.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.320]   Just like how a little bit of a light in a room
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.480]   can completely change a dark room.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.320]   You, brothers and sisters, are called
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.680]   to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.480]   And you may be a minority, but the encouragement is this,
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.720]   there is a reward that awaits you.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:07.600]   So keep running that race, keep fighting the good fight.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.640]   And what will you get in return?
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:16.680]   You'll get to walk with me in white, for you are worthy.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.920]   The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.240]   and I will never blot out his name.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.200]   You get to walk with him.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.480]   This is Jesus' promise and encouragement to you,
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:28.040]   that you will be able to walk with him in white.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:28.880]   Why white?
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.040]   What's the whole point of that?
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   It's just like a wedding dress,
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.680]   it's like a bride standing before her groom
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.000]   in a white wedding dress.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.240]   It's a sign of purity,
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.360]   it's a sign of righteousness and holiness.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:44.040]   And Jesus is saying, if you don't soil your own garments,
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.720]   I will clothe you in white.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:52.120]   You will be presented to God as blameless.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.440]   Your name will be written down in the book of life
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:58.360]   and it will never be blotted out.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.640]   Which is probably an important message to the church,
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.120]   to the people of Sardis,
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.920]   who probably because of all the captures
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.160]   had different royal names being blotted out,
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:10.160]   but he is saying, I will never blot out your name
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.280]   and you will be clothed in white with me.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:18.280]   So remain resilient, remain resilient, wake up.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   Remember what you received and heard, keep it, repent,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.120]   turn away and you will get a reward.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.080]   And here is the key word.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.440]   Jesus says, you will walk with me.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.520]   Even if you're the minority, you will walk with me.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.120]   I am the one doing great things,
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.960]   I am the one making all things new,
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.400]   you just have to walk with me.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.560]   But you see, there's a problem.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.480]   Sometimes when we are the minority,
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.040]   not only do we get weary
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.080]   and just completely go back into our own shell,
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.280]   the other thing is we just think we're gonna fight
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.080]   and win souls for Jesus.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:56.640]   And we're gonna do everything for him.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.000]   Jesus, you stay back there,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.040]   I am gonna go and fight this battle
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.680]   and do what I can for you.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.680]   Jesus is saying, no, walk with me, don't do things for me.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.800]   Jesus is calling them not out to action necessarily,
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:13.240]   Jesus is calling them in to his presence.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.760]   Because that's the only way that we will stay awake.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.720]   Not the maybe the new term now of being woke,
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.640]   that is different.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.000]   Not completely different,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.560]   but this idea of just being aware
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.040]   that Jesus is in your life
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.000]   and that he may call you to speak
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.880]   into racial, economical, political issues.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.440]   But the key isn't those things,
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.680]   the key is being close to him, to walking with him.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.280]   Because if you walk with him,
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.000]   you will be clothed in white,
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   you will be righteous, you will be blameless.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.320]   So my encouragement to you is if you are a minority
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.600]   or if you are struggling to hold on,
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.800]   Jesus sees you, Jesus sees you,
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.520]   so keep on that path, keep going.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.640]   For those of you who are sleepwalking,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.240]   I'm saying, wake up, wake up.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.440]   Because Jesus is calling you into his presence
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.440]   and calling you into action.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.960]   There is no time and no space
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.840]   where we can be spiritually asleep,
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.920]   especially at such a time as this.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.880]   And the final verse that we keep seeing
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.920]   over and over again, verse six,
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.480]   "He who has an ear, let him hear
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.800]   "what the Spirit says to the churches."
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.480]   He who has an ear, everyone here has an ear.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.040]   So Jesus is speaking to all of us here.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.360]   But why do we have to trust him?
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.720]   Why do you have to commit to following him
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:50.200]   and hearing these words?
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:52.800]   Because he can be trusted.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.280]   He says here, "The one who conquers
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.480]   "will be clothed thus in white garments."
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.240]   We can trust him because he conquered,
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.720]   because he was the one that conquered death,
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.360]   because he was thought to be dead,
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.440]   but is now alive.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.720]   He had a reputation for being a rebel,
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.320]   for not submitting to authorities,
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:20.440]   for threatening to overthrow the Roman Empire.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.800]   But instead, the reality was he submitted himself,
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.040]   sacrificed himself, and ended up ushering in
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.040]   a completely new kingdom that was not of this world,
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.440]   that outlived the Roman Empire.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.640]   That is why we can trust him.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.000]   That is why we need to take heed of what he says.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.080]   We need to remember what he did for us.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.920]   And then we need to repent and choose to follow him.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.440]   And we know that there will be a reward.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.280]   Why?
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.080]   Because of what he did for us.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.960]   See, our works were incomplete,
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.600]   but Jesus, he came to this earth,
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.720]   and he finished it by declaring three words.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.280]   It is finished.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.520]   And by carrying out his purpose,
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.200]   his work was complete, and we, he had one job.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.960]   We had one job to do, and that was to save all of us.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.840]   And he did it via the cross.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.320]   And he got his Father in heaven,
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.000]   opened up the heavens and declared,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.400]   "This is my Son, with whom I am well pleased."
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.720]   The words every Chinese child yearns to hear
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.760]   from their parents.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.120]   Because his works were complete.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:41.080]   And his reward was now that his name is above every name.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.200]   That even though he shed his blood,
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.840]   that he wore the crown of thorns,
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.360]   he now has white garments and robes.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:53.360]   And the key is that he now offers those garments to you.
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.400]   That he is saying,
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.280]   "It doesn't matter what you've done in the past.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.400]   "I've dealt with it.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.240]   "It is gone.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.040]   "It is complete."
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.840]   It doesn't matter how sleepy you've been in your life.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.840]   He has the power to speak life into you.
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.680]   It doesn't matter if you feel as though your life
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.240]   is just a valley of dry bones.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:16.520]   Scripture tells us that the Spirit of God, Jesus himself,
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.200]   has the power to speak life into you.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.240]   And that is my encouragement to you today.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:28.240]   Church of Hong Kong, Church of Kung Fu, wake up.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.720]   Arise, O sleeper.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:37.720]   Rise from the dead and Christ will shine on you.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:44.160]   And we all know that there is a 95% majority out there
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:52.000]   that their souls depend on us waking up
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.360]   and sharing that good news with them.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.840]   Brothers, sisters, are you awake?
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.000]   Let's pray.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:19.560]   Jesus, we come before you and we hear this wake up call.
[00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.640]   We know that you see every aspect of our lives.
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.680]   You know that we are prone to sleepwalking.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:34.280]   We are prone to chasing for things, meaningless pursuits.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:41.960]   Or you know our inactive state.
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:43.800]   And we come before you and we repent.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:48.120]   We remember that you did not call us to a life
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.800]   of just comfort, of complacency.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.080]   But that you've called us to be active parts of your body.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:04.560]   So we pray that your spirit will strengthen what remains
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.720]   and is about to die.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.920]   Lord, I know that there are people in this room
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.880]   who are clinging on for dear life
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.440]   in their own spiritual lives.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.280]   And I pray, Lord, that your spirit will strengthen
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.880]   what remains, that you will help them rise up again,
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.240]   Lord, that you will shine on them.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.080]   That you will remind them that this is a gift
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:26.240]   that they can receive.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.120]   There is nothing that they need to do
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.200]   other than open their arms to you.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:35.640]   Lord, because you were the one that conquered death.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:40.640]   And Lord, because of your grace,
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.880]   you shared our victory with us.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.680]   You were the one that was dead, but was then alive.
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:52.520]   And because of that, we who are dead can also now be alive.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.240]   (gentle music)
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.760]   So we declare together as one body,
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.360]   albeit the minority in this city.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.400]   We declare with everything that we have
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:10.400]   that Jesus, you are alive.
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:14.000]   And that we rejoice.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.920]   And we allow that fact head from our heads into our hearts
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.560]   and then spur us into action in our hands and feet.
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:34.000]   We as a body desire to be woken up
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.040]   and to follow you.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:43.480]   And it's in your precious name we pray, amen.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:45.980]   (piano music)
