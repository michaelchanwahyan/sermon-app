1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 It's been great.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:15,200
 This series is on the church, and it's amazing to see how we as the church have grown throughout

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,180
 the years and how we can still continue to grow.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,820
 And today we're talking about a hospitality-driven church.

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,520
 And Pastor John introduced this sermon for us, and he talked about this chair, right?

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,960
 How the church tries to just stand on one leg, right?

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,040
 Whether it's prayer, community, generosity, or the Word of God, they're trying to just

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,080
 stand on one leg, right?

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:47,560
 And maybe it's one amazing speaker, and they're just trying to depend on that.

10
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,200
 And Pastor James talked to us last week about gathering about God's Word.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,600
 And what analogy did he use?

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,380
 It wasn't a chair, it was a?

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,820
 It was a stool, right?

14
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,760
 And the stool represented the Word of God, and the legs represented that each thing was

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,080
 the Word of God allowed us to have prayer, community, and hospitality.

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,760
 And today we're talking about sharing meals and taking communion together.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,640
 And who likes food here?

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
 Yeah?

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,960
 Okay, some of you are on a diet.

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,440
 So my analogy this week is a table, and it's a round table, but I won't tell you what it

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,840
 means until the end.

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,320
 I remember I was in Sydney, and Hillsong has been going through all sorts of drama lately,

23
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,920
 but when I went to the church in Sydney, as you see in the next slide, I had a great time.

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,200
 The worship was amazing, the talk was amazing, and afterwards the welcoming team invited

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
 me to have a free lunch.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,800
 And it was like, wow, you know, it was great company, it was great food, and then afterwards

27
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
 they drove me home also.

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,400
 So it was like, wow, such a great time of worshiping God together and having community

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
 together.

30
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,240
 And I remember in the next slide, I was in UK, and I joined this church, it was a Baptist

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:30,440
 church, and we had a time of mingling afterwards, and there was food and lunch afterwards, and

32
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,520
 it was just so good just connecting with the people there and talking to them about, you

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,840
 know, what I do and how I'm doing some mission work in other countries.

34
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
 And they're like, "Oh, we should partner together."

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,280
 It was so amazing.

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,320
 I remember this one time I went to New Zealand, and I was actually sitting beside somebody

37
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,760
 who went to church.

38
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,360
 And after the flight, they were like, "You should come over for a meal."

39
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
 And so I went over to their meal.

40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,080
 Oh, I've known them for, I don't know, like 12 hours, that's the flight time.

41
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,600
 And they invited me over for a meal.

42
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,360
 And afterwards, I went to church with them, and they prayed over me because I was heading

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,640
 to do missions afterwards, to India to do missions.

44
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:24,600
 The meals I had with them and the times I shared with them, they were precious moments,

45
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:30,600
 precious moments of connecting not only with each other, but with the Lord.

46
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,040
 And this is what the early church did.

47
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,600
 It says in Acts chapter 2, they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship,

48
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,400
 to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,400
 And this word koinonia, fellowship, it also appears in 1 John chapter 1.

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,840
 And this is what it says, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which

51
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,720
 we have seen with our eyes, we have looked upon, that which we have seen and heard, we

52
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:08,480
 proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us.

53
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,480
 And indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ."

54
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:23,040
 It says it very clearly here, that John has experienced Jesus and the things he's experienced

55
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:32,520
 because of Jesus, he's sharing it to them so that we can have fellowship with each other

56
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,680
 because we have fellowship with God.

57
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:43,400
 This word koinonia, fellowship, not only does it mean gathering and community, but it also

58
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,200
 means that we are participants, we are sharing something.

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
 We're sharing something.

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,360
 And the best example of this is, of course, the Trinity.

61
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,440
 The Trinity, right?

62
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,200
 The Trinity is three in one, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

63
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,320
 They are sharing in fellowship.

64
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:14,920
 They are sharing love, communicating with each other, working with each other, yet there

65
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,480
 is unity.

66
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,760
 There is unity.

67
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:26,000
 God is the greatest example of fellowship, the three in one.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
 And God created us.

69
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:37,280
 We were made in His image, and He created us also for this longing for connection, right?

70
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,960
 Who's experienced this longing for deep connection before in their life?

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,880
 Yeah, you've experienced it?

72
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,200
 There's this connection.

73
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,920
 We want to connect with people around us.

74
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:58,560
 And ultimately, God created us for a spiritual connection, a relationship with Him.

75
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,560
 And we see in these circles, right, that there's so many connections that God created.

76
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,320
 God created a relationship with Him first, and then with Adam and Eve, God created the

77
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,960
 relationship, connection with marriage, and with marriage came family, family, the church,

78
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,120
 and the society.

79
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:26,080
 And today, we're going to look at three different areas in the Bible of table fellowship.

80
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,520
 We're going to look at the Old Testament, we're going to look at the New Testament,

81
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,960
 and then we're going to look at the Eternal Testament or eternal times, OT, NT, and ET.

82
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,560
 I just try to make it rhyme, you know?

83
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,400
 OT, NT, and ET.

84
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,400
 Going home?

85
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
 Oh, yeah, ET, yeah, yeah.

86
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
 Yeah, go home.

87
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:54,360
 The first part we're going to look at is the Old Testament, and we're going to look at

88
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,080
 Exodus chapter 24 together.

89
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,440
 And so, this is what was happening.

90
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,480
 The Israelites, they had the great Exodus out of bondage, out of Egypt, and then they

91
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,120
 became free, and they arrived at Mount Sinai.

92
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,840
 Did you guys go to Mount Sinai during your Israel trip?

93
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
 No?

94
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
 I want to go to Mount Sinai.

95
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,920
 We'll hike off and maybe I'll experience the Lord there.

96
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,000
 It would be amazing, right?

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,520
 And so, what happened was Moses was on the mountain, right?

98
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,120
 And then they invited, you know, Moses and Aaron and the 70 elders.

99
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,400
 They went up, and they saw God at the Mount of Sinai.

100
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,960
 And on Mount Sinai, do you know what they did together?

101
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:49,960
 In verse 11, it says this, "He did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of

102
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,960
 Israel.

103
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,240
 They beheld God and ate and drank."

104
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,520
 They went up Mount Sinai, and God was there, and the elders saw him.

105
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,200
 And what did they do?

106
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,400
 They ate and they drank.

107
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,320
 They had fellowship with God on Mount Sinai.

108
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,000
 It must have been a nice picnic.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,400
 I don't know what it was.

110
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,960
 They were eating, maybe more manna, or manna hadn't come yet, but special bread.

111
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,000
 The Old Testament is full of festivals.

112
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,400
 So on Mount Sinai, then God gave Moses what?

113
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,560
 The laws, the 10 commandments, right?

114
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,440
 And then Moses shared them with the people.

115
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,960
 And there was all these festivals, right?

116
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:53,540
 The Sabbath celebrates the rest that God had after creation.

117
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,720
 And on the Sabbath, the Jewish nation would eat together.

118
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
 They wouldn't work.

119
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,360
 They would gather together to remember what God had created and to rest.

120
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,480
 On the Passover, they were feasting to celebrate the Exodus.

121
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,120
 I remember in our church, we invited some Jewish people to come and share about the

122
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,240
 Passover, and it was so interesting.

123
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:33,840
 The roasted shank bone that they have represents the sacrifice that the people had to endure.

124
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,040
 The egg that they eat during Passover represents spring and the circle of life.

125
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:48,040
 The bitter herbs that they have represented the bitterness of slavery.

126
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:54,320
 The three pieces of unleavened bread represents the bread that the Israelites took with them

127
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,240
 when they fled Egypt.

128
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:08,100
 The salt water that they have during the Passover represents the tears that the slaves had.

129
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:18,800
 When they are eating the Passover meal, every part of the meal represents something that

130
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,800
 God did.

131
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,640
 Imagine eating together, remembering God together.

132
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:36,040
 There is both vertical fellowship with the Lord and horizontal fellowship with each other.

133
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,520
 There's more festivals.

134
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:44,680
 The first festivals of the first fruits is remembering God's providence.

135
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,440
 The festival of trumpets was a day of reminding people to reflect on themselves.

136
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,640
 There would be a big trumpet that would be blown, and people would be called to remember

137
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,280
 what they had done and repent before the Lord.

138
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:09,480
 They had this dipped apple in honey that wished everybody a good and sweet new year.

139
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,560
 The festival of tabernacles points to the commandment that God told them to stay temporarily

140
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:22,000
 in the tents in the desert before the temple was made.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,120
 So we see here in the Old Testament, they ate.

142
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,840
 They ate with the Lord.

143
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:36,760
 The examples of the elders eating together, there was vertical worship, fellowship with

144
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,560
 the Lord when they ate.

145
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,800
 When they ate together with all these festivals, they remembered, they celebrated, they worshiped

146
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:51,720
 God for what they had done, how the Lord had saved them.

147
00:11:51,720 --> 00:12:00,200
 And when they ate together, they also remembered and reflected upon their sins and what they

148
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,360
 had done wrong.

149
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,120
 Not only was there vertical fellowship with the Lord, there was horizontal fellowship

150
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:15,920
 with each other as they dined together with all these festivals.

151
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,000
 So that is the Old Testament, just a short glimpse of some of the things that they did

152
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 in the Old Testament.

153
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,920
 We're going to look at the New Testament, and there's a famous New Testament story.

154
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,440
 There was a wedding.

155
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,240
 There was a wedding, and Jesus was attending with his mother.

156
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,720
 And you know how sometimes mothers are like, "Come on, son, do this," or "Do that."

157
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,520
 Anybody have a mother that sort of nudges?

158
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
 Yeah?

159
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,520
 Are you talking about Sandra?

160
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
 No?

161
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,960
 Okay, okay.

162
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:56,280
 Sometimes there's a mother that sort of nudges, "Sit properly," or "Fix your hair," or "Don't

163
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,000
 do this," or "Don't do that."

164
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,200
 And Jesus was at this wedding, and Mary was like, "Jesus, they're kind of running out

165
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,320
 of wine here.

166
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,960
 And if you don't have wine in a wedding, what's going to happen?

167
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
 You've run out of wine.

168
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,840
 What's going to happen?"

169
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,240
 It's sort of embarrassing, right?

170
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,600
 It's an embarrassment to the hosts, and people are probably just going to start going home.

171
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,160
 Pastor John's going to start going home, right?

172
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,960
 That's what he said.

173
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,200
 And so Jesus was like, look at this statement.

174
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,760
 "Woman, what does this have to do with me?

175
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,520
 My hour has not yet come."

176
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,980
 And his mother was like, "Just do whatever Jesus tells you."

177
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:49,340
 And so Jesus sees these six stone jars, okay?

178
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:53,040
 They're huge jars holding 20 to 30 gallons.

179
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,960
 They're huge.

180
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,880
 And do you know what these gallons or these stone jars, the water within them, are used

181
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
 for?

182
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,040
 What are they used for?

183
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,040
 Well, it says here, it says for purification, all right?

184
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
 Purification.

185
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,480
 So what would they wash?

186
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,600
 They wash their feet, right?

187
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,960
 Anybody have smelly feet that they need to wash?

188
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,680
 Don't tell me, I don't need to know.

189
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,840
 But imagine their dirty feet, right?

190
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,040
 They're wearing sandals.

191
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,320
 They're walking through the mud.

192
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,800
 You think they had cement, you know, pavements back then?

193
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
 They didn't.

194
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
 It was maybe...

195
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
 Maybe it rained, right?

196
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,080
 And it's raining and they're walking, you know?

197
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,880
 And so they arrived to the wedding.

198
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,280
 Of course, they need to wash, right?

199
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,780
 To the temple, they wash.

200
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,040
 And Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water."

201
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,160
 And they filled them to the brim.

202
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:55,680
 And he said to them, "Now draw some water and take it to the master of the feast."

203
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
 And they took it.

204
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,200
 Can you imagine those servants?

205
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
 They take...

206
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,200
 It should be water filled.

207
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,200
 Should I take it to the master?

208
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,680
 Do you think it turned to wine right at the stone?

209
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,920
 Or do you think they needed some sort of faith to walk and go towards the master?

210
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,600
 And they give it to the master.

211
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,840
 And the master says...

212
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,840
 What does he say?

213
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,240
 "Everyone serves the good wine first.

214
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,120
 And when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine, that you have kept the good wine

215
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,800
 until now."

216
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,160
 Jesus ate with these people.

217
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,640
 He participated with these people.

218
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,200
 He kept the party going.

219
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,280
 That's what Jesus did.

220
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,240
 He kept the party going.

221
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,920
 It was about to die down and he was like, "I'm going to resurrect this party to life."

222
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,000
 So Jesus ate with the people.

223
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,120
 He had horizontal fellowship with these people.

224
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,800
 Not only did he have dinners and wedding banquets, he also reclined with people that weren't

225
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,800
 so popular.

226
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,440
 We'll see in the next verse, he ate at a Levite's house.

227
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,880
 And there was a large company of tax collectors there.

228
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,320
 Tax collectors, they have a special word, sinners and tax collectors.

229
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,760
 That's how bad they were.

230
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,120
 These were people that betrayed us.

231
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,680
 They're working for the Romans.

232
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,280
 They're tax collectors.

233
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:49,560
 Jesus also ate at the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.

234
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,840
 And so we see here from Jesus, the lessons to be learned is that he kept the party going.

235
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,280
 He kept the wedding going.

236
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,360
 There was horizontal connection.

237
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,920
 He attended these dinners with people that believed in him and also people that needed

238
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,520
 him.

239
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:18,240
 He had horizontal connection and he also invites us to vertical worship and connection when

240
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,120
 he invites us to his dinner.

241
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,120
 And that is communion.

242
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,320
 And in Luke chapter 22, it says this, "He took bread and when he had given thanks, he

243
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,000
 broke it and said to them, 'This is my body broken for you.

244
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,360
 Do this in remembrance of me.'

245
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:47,080
 And likewise, the cup that they had, he said this, 'This cup that is poured out for you

246
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,840
 is the new covenant in my blood.'"

247
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:58,760
 Jesus invites us to a dinner that connects with himself.

248
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,080
 A vertical connection with the Lord himself.

249
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:10,840
 And when we partake in communion, we are united with Christ.

250
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:19,720
 We are united because we eat his flesh and we drink his blood, which represents his body

251
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:26,380
 sacrificed for us and his blood poured out for us for sins.

252
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:35,040
 When we partake in communion, we are united as a body of Christ, horizontally with each

253
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,160
 other.

254
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:45,160
 It says in 1 Corinthians, "Because there is one loaf, we who are many are one body, for

255
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,640
 we share in that one loaf."

256
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,040
 We are saved because of one person, one body, one sacrifice.

257
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:02,720
 In communion, we are connected with each other as children of God.

258
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,920
 And lastly, in communion, we are united in hope.

259
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,760
 And what is our hope?

260
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,400
 What is our hope?

261
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,280
 Our hope is not just in this world.

262
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,080
 Our hope isn't in the stock market that it will do wonders for us.

263
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,200
 It's going up and down, up and down, right?

264
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,400
 Or down for John.

265
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,360
 That's what he said, not me.

266
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:35,560
 Our hope is that one day God will come again and that there will be a new heaven and a

267
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,720
 new earth.

268
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,680
 We're not made for this world.

269
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:44,840
 We are made for eternity.

270
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,480
 Eternity.

271
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,360
 And in communion, we are taking part in eternity.

272
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,480
 And we're going to look at eternal times now, our eternal testaments.

273
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,520
 Let's look at Isaiah chapter 25.

274
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,600
 Isaiah, the prophet, prophesied this about eternity, about heaven.

275
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,920
 On this mountain, the Lord of hosts will make all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast

276
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,480
 of well-aged wine, a rich food full of marrow, of aged wine and well-refined.

277
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,480
 Wow.

278
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,680
 This sounds like a good menu.

279
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,240
 You guys salivating already?

280
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,280
 Good wine, good food, rich food.

281
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
 Wow.

282
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,240
 In eternity, we're going to eat with the Lord on his mountain.

283
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,920
 Wow.

284
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,480
 Let's look at Revelations, what it says.

285
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:49,200
 Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of the great multitude.

286
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
 Great multitude.

287
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,120
 Imagine just a great multitude of people in heaven, all gathered together.

288
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,640
 What are they doing?

289
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,640
 This is what they say.

290
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
 Hallelujah.

291
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,760
 For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns.

292
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,040
 Let us rejoice and exalt and give him the glory for the marriage of the lamb has come

293
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,680
 and his bride has made herself ready.

294
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,600
 And the angel said to me, "Write this.

295
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:23,120
 Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb."

296
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,840
 In heaven, we're going to be feasting with the Lord.

297
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:41,160
 The marriage supper of the lamb, celebrating us being in eternity with the Lord because

298
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,680
 of what he's done.

299
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,480
 And when does eternity start?

300
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,680
 When does eternity start?

301
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,880
 In John chapter 17, verse 3, it says this.

302
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:04,200
 Now this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you

303
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,080
 have sent.

304
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:16,640
 When you know Jesus, eternity starts.

305
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,560
 Do you know Jesus?

306
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:28,520
 Because if you know Jesus, eternity has started.

307
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,040
 What can we learn from eternity?

308
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,400
 These passages of eternity in the Bible.

309
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,920
 We see here that there's this triangle, right?

310
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,900
 Horizontal is human to human connection.

311
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:55,080
 And then God, as we, as Christians and followers of God, as we get closer to God, what happens

312
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,680
 in this triangle?

313
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,880
 What happens?

314
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,960
 As we get closer to God, we become closer to each other.

315
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,840
 Does that make sense?

316
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,720
 That's how a triangle works.

317
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,520
 Just so you know, if you're awake.

318
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:21,700
 As we get closer to God, as we become more like Jesus Christ, as the Holy Spirit is working

319
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:32,200
 within us, reminding us to repent and to become more like him, molding us, sanctifying us,

320
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,040
 we become closer to God and we become closer to each other.

321
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:44,760
 Just like in 1 John, it said, when we read before, we have fellowship with God and with

322
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,520
 each other.

323
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:57,680
 This is where the horizontal fellowship connection meets the vertical connection.

324
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:07,640
 Table fellowship can be viewed as a rehearsal for eternal fellowship.

325
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,120
 Table fellowship can be viewed as a rehearsal for eternal fellowship.

326
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,720
 When believers gather together with the Holy Spirit inside of them and their bodies as

327
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:29,200
 the temple of God to do the will of the Lord, each table fellowship we take can be considered

328
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,800
 a step towards eternity.

329
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:41,440
 When there is both vertical and horizontal connection, we edge closer in our relationship

330
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,880
 with God and with each other.

331
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:53,160
 Table fellowship can be regarded as an eternal action.

332
00:24:53,160 --> 00:25:04,000
 The importance of eating together as Christians gather is that it's not just temporary.

333
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,240
 We're doing something eternal.

334
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,980
 We're spending time with people that will be in heaven.

335
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,540
 We're connecting with God and praying for the food.

336
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:29,200
 We're spending time with each other as a step towards eternity, a rehearsal for eternal

337
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
 fellowship.

338
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:43,520
 That one day, that amazing marriage supper of the Lamb, we are going towards that.

339
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,000
 This table, if you look at it from a bird's eye view, you'll see it.

340
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,080
 What will you see?

341
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
 You'll see it in the next slide.

342
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,320
 It's a point.

343
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,800
 That's the point I'm trying to make.

344
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:08,400
 That as we go closer to God and to each other, we will arrive.

345
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:20,960
 We're arriving closer and closer to that eternal marriage supper of the Lamb.

346
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,760
 I'm going to end with a story.

347
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,800
 The story is this.

348
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,960
 Everybody knows what I like to play.

349
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
 What do I like to play?

350
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
 Basketball.

351
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,480
 I play basketball at the basketball court.

352
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,840
 Everybody knows me so well.

353
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:50,120
 I was playing basketball with a high school student and he brought a friend.

354
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,800
 We started playing ball together more and more.

355
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,280
 So what happened was this.

356
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,280
 I was like, "Hey, you want to grab dinner sometime?"

357
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,520
 Who do you usually eat with?

358
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,680
 I know in Hong Kong it's so small, you're basically eating with everybody in the restaurant.

359
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,760
 But usually you eat with people you know, that you're friends with, that you connect

360
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,200
 well with.

361
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,360
 I felt like, "Okay, we've been playing ball for so long together.

362
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
 Let's go eat."

363
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,680
 So we ate together.

364
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,640
 That started a friendship.

365
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,360
 There was this one time, he was in high school, and we started a friendship.

366
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,000
 He was like, "What are you doing tomorrow?"

367
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,520
 I'm like, "I'm going to camp, to church camp."

368
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,720
 He's like, "Oh, I like camp."

369
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,200
 So I'm like, "Well, why don't you come?"

370
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
 I call up Carmen.

371
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,960
 I'm like, "Yo, there's this kid.

372
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,520
 He wants to come to camp tomorrow."

373
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,400
 It's a youth camp.

374
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,920
 He signs up, and he comes to camp.

375
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,640
 And slowly he gets to know God more.

376
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,560
 And I invite him out.

377
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:06,520
 We hand out food boxes every week, and I invite him out because he likes to help out.

378
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,820
 And I invite him out to our fellowship time, and he starts coming to fellowship every week.

379
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,500
 He starts coming to hand out boxes every other week, food boxes every other week.

380
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:27,160
 And three months later, I decided, I was like, "I'm going to fully share the gospel with

381
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 him."

382
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,600
 And so we go to, we play basketball, and then afterwards we have dinner together.

383
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,400
 And so there's the three of us, and we have dinner together.

384
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,940
 And then afterwards, I'm just like, "Hey, I want to share something with you."

385
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,700
 And I draw the gospel for him.

386
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:54,400
 And I explain it fully to him, and I explain fully how Jesus is our only way to eternity.

387
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,820
 And through this meal, he asked Jesus into his life.

388
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:10,380
 And so what started off was an introduction meal, became regular fellowship, and then

389
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:19,860
 became a rehearsal for eternal fellowship because he asked Jesus into his life, and

390
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:25,460
 that's the beginning of eternal life.

391
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:35,220
 And so my question to you as we look at this empty table is, who do you want to invite

392
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,300
 to this table?

393
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,420
 Who do you want to invite to this table?

394
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:48,860
 As the worship band comes up, I'm going to ask us to reflect on who has God placed in

395
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,200
 your life?

396
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,140
 Maybe it's a business person, it's a coworker, maybe it's a fellow student in your life.

397
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,400
 Maybe these people are struggling, or maybe they're lonely.

398
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:10,260
 Maybe you're good friends with them and you have dinner regularly.

399
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:20,420
 How will you use the table to lead people towards eternity?

400
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:30,820
 How will you use the table the Lord has given you to lead people towards eternity?

401
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:39,560
 Maybe it's your relative because there's a holiday coming up and it's a family holiday.

402
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:50,260
 Maybe this is the time to use the table, the dinner table fellowship as an opportunity

403
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:56,100
 to lead them closer towards eternity.

404
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:11,980
 Let us take a moment to reflect, and then we will respond with a song later.

405
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:29,580
 Heavenly Father, we thank you for the examples you've taught us in the Bible.

406
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,620
 Feasting is not just about food.

407
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,060
 It can be so much more.

408
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:42,060
 It can be about horizontal fellowship with each other, and ultimately vertical fellowship

409
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,060
 with you.

410
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:49,140
 I thank you, Lord, for the different people that you've placed in our lives.

411
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:56,380
 Give us spiritual eyes, Lord, that we might see the needs of the people, and that we might

412
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:05,220
 use this table as a tool to lead them one step closer towards eternity.

413
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,700
 In Christ's name we pray.

414
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,460
 Amen.

415
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:18,460
