[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]  (字幕: 李卓人)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.440]  我們今天的主題是
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.240]  "主宰靈性的宇宙"
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.240]  主宰靈性的宇宙
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.440]  我們今年開始讀哪本書呢?
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.160]  知道嗎?
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160]  Mark的書
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.760]  如同你所見的下一個頁
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.640]  Mark的書
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.640]  我們學習了很多東西
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.320]  耶穌主宰了靈性的宇宙
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.880]  祂可以治癒病人
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.880]  可以把人變成石頭和麵包
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.880]  祂可以給予五千人
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.880]  祂也是聖誕老人
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.880]  上週我們學到耶穌是聖誕老人
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.880]  今天我們要學到
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.880]  耶穌是主宰靈性的宇宙
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.880]  主宰靈性的宇宙
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.880]  我們一起讀Mark 4
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.880]  一起讀
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.880]  1,2,3
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.880]  (翻譯)
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.880]  (翻譯)
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:30.880]  (看著畫面)
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:52.880]  (看著畫面)
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.880]  耶穌去了新的地區
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.880]  (看著畫面)
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.880]  很多人想祂被治癒
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.880]  有些人有不潔的靈魂
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.880]  我們知道聖靈有聖靈
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.880]  但也有不潔的靈魂
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.880]  不潔的靈魂跟祂說
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.880]  You are the son of God
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.880]  不潔的靈魂知道耶穌是誰
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880]  我問你們
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.880]  Do you believe in the spiritual realm?
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.880]  That there is unclean spirits
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.880]  That there is demons, angels
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.880]  誰覺得有靈魂的?
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.880]  因為有靈魂的
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.880]  這些女孩沒想過
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.880]  只有有靈魂的
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.880]  (看著畫面)
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.880]  (看著畫面)
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.880]  聖經說
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:22.880]  (看著畫面)
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.880]  聖經很清楚說
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.880]  是有靈魂的
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880]  (看著畫面)
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.880]  下一個畫面是一個回答機
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.880]  有一次我小時候在彈琴
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.880]  (彈琴)
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.880]  有個回答機
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.880]  誰以前有個回答機?
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.880]  Mentors應該有吧
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.880]  有人打來
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.880]  你不聽電話
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.880]  就自動錄音回答
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.880]  Message
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.880]  我彈琴的時候
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.880]  我小時候像你們一樣
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.880]  有個Message是這樣的
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.880]  黃牧師
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.880]  為什麼你不聽電話?
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.880]  我像你們這個年紀
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.880]  你覺得你的反應會怎樣?
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.880]  這個人有什麼問題?
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.880]  我爸爸回來的時候
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.880]  我爸爸是牧師
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.880]  他就解釋了
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.880]  Johnny你還好嗎?
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.880]  因為這個回答機
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.880]  是我幫這個人
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.880]  做Exorcism
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.880]  Exorcism
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.880]  所以那是我第一次
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.880]  遇到靈魂的世界
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.880]  我就覺得
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.880]  哇!這些東西真的存在
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.880]  那我就問你
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.880]  你有沒有遇到靈魂的世界?
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.880]  你有看過一些東西嗎?
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.880]  它們可以是天使
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.880]  可以是魔鬼
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.880]  它們存在
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.880]  撒旦、魔鬼
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.880]  我問一下你們
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.880]  你覺得是從哪裡來的?
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.880]  這些魔鬼、不潔的靈魂
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.880]  它們從哪裡來的?
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.880]  有沒有人知道?
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.880]  它們是人類的嗎?
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.880]  你覺得它們是人類的嗎?
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.880]  還有誰知道?
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.880]  它們是從哪裡來的?
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.880]  它們是從哪裡來的?
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.880]  有沒有人知道?
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.880]  這三個人是誰來的?
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.880]  知道嗎?
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.880]  這三個人是誰來的?
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.880]  有人知道嗎?
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.880]  這個是
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.880]  神創造
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.880]  三頭天使
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.880]  三頭天使
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.880]  它們的名字是甚麼?
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.880]  有沒有人知道?
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.880]  M字頭的
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.880]  Michael
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:56.880]  有沒有人知道?
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.880]  是Michael的
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.880]  第一頭天使的名字是Michael
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.880]  第二是G字頭的
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.880]  有沒有人知道?
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.880]  Gabriel
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.880]  第三是甚麼名字?
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.880]  是甚麼?
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.880]  L字頭的
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.880]  Lucifer
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.880]  三頭天使
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:17.880]  Michael
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880]  Gabriel
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.880]  Lucifer
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.880]  但是Lucifer
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.880]  發生了甚麼事?
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.880]  為甚麼神創造了他
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.880]  是一個天使
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:29.880]  發生了甚麼事?
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.880]  我們看Isaiah 14
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880]  我們一起讀
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.880]  準備,1,2,3
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.880]  (英文)
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.880]  (英文)
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.880]  (英文)
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.880]  (英文)
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.880]  Lucifer,神創造了他
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.880]  是怎樣的?
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.880]  是一個Morning Star
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880]  這裡寫
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.880]  Old Day Star
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:20.880]  很漂亮的
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.880]  他是一個Beautiful
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.880]  其實我不用戴口罩
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.880]  他是一個Beautiful Morning Star
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.880]  但是他怎樣?
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.880]  他就怎樣?
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.880]  他覺得他自己怎樣?
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.880]  他就開始驕傲
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.880]  驕傲呢?
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.880]  Pride
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.880]  他覺得他自己很漂亮
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.880]  很偉大
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.880]  I will make myself like the most high
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.880]  他覺得自己可以像神一樣
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.880]  This angel had pride
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.880]  And what happened to him?
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.880]  結果是甚麼?
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.880]  Not death
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.880]  He was fallen
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.880]  God threw him down to the earth
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.880]  To Shiloh
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.880]  To the far reaches of the pit
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.880]  我們看到
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.880]  這個是The beginning
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.880]  The start of Satan
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.880]  和他的Legions
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.880]  His followers
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.880]  The angels that followed Lucifer
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.880]  What happened to them?
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.880]  They were all thrown towards the earth
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.880]  這些魔鬼有甚麼能力?
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.880]  他們可以做甚麼?
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.880]  有沒有人記得?
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.880]  這些魔鬼可以做甚麼?
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.880]  首先他們可以擁有人
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.880]  他們可以擁有人
[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.880]  如果人們給他們控制
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.880]  他們可以擁有他們
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.880]  並且鼓勵他們
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.880]  並且造成他們的身體和靈性傷害
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.880]  他們可以使他們做惡
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.880]  我們可以看到
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.880]  在整個福音書中
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.880]  當魔鬼擁有他們
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.880]  他們有超自然的能力
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.880]  我沒有見過
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.880]  但我聽說有些朋友
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.880]  見過有人擁有魔鬼時
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.880]  他有超自然的能力
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.880]  超自然的能力
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.880]  魔鬼可以做甚麼?
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.880]  他可以盯著我們的心
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.880]  保護我們從真相中
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.880]  他們可以欺騙人
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.880]  欺騙人
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.880]  以為他們是正義的
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.880]  就像反對耶穌基督
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.880]  他可以欺騙人
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.880]  推動謊言
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.880]  魔鬼可以推動謊言
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.880]  他們可以造成證據
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.880]  來欺騙人
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.880]  這些魔鬼是有能力的
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.880]  這些不潔的靈魂
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.880]  是有能力的
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.880]  他們有能力
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.880]  我們繼續讀
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.880]  馬克四書
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.880]  我們繼續讀
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.880]  馬克四書
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.880]  跟著我讀
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.880]  準備
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.880]  我們一二三
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.880]  (文章繼續)
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.880]  (文章繼續)
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.880]  (文章繼續)
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.880]  (文章繼續)
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.880]  (文章繼續)
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.880]  (文章結束)
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.880]  首先
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.880]  這些寫信徒是誰來的?
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.880]  這些寫信徒是
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.880]  法律的老師
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.880]  寫信徒
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.880]  他們很認識
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.880]  舊約
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.880]  他們認識
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.880]  和真正了解
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.880]  舊約
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880]  他們就下來
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.880]  他們就上去
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880]  Galilee
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880]  上去怎樣?
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.880]  指責耶穌
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880]  是甚麼?
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.880]  是謊言
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.880]  指責耶穌是謊言
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.880]  寫信徒指責耶穌的兩件事
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.880]  第一件事
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.880]  是耶穌自己
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.880]  是被波茲巴擁有
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.880]  第二件事
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.880]  是耶穌有能力
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.880]  耶穌為甚麼有能力
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.880]  去驅散這些靈魂?
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.880]  因為祂
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.880]  是
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.880]  給予靈魂權力
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.880]  由魔鬼主子
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.880]  即是是神自己
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.880]  波茲巴是誰來的?
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.880]  波茲巴
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.880]  下一頁
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.880]  是誰來的?
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.880]  是巴爾
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.880]  是古代的
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.880]  堅尼亞人的神
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.880]  如果在舊約讀
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.880]  那些是
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.880]  神
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:06.880]  在人們的名義上
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.880]  為巴爾的神
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.880]  而祈禱
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.880]  也是一個名字
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.880]  給神的
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.880]  也是一個名字
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.880]  給神的
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.880]  那麼
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.880]  這些徒弟就說
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.880]  耶穌為甚麼可以驅散這些靈魂?
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.880]  因為祂自己
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880]  是
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.880]  被魔鬼主子權力
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.880]  祂自己是被魔鬼主子權力
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.880]  耶穌就說
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.880]  這怎麼可能?
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.880]  一個分裂的房子
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.880]  不可能站起來
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.880]  一個分裂的房子
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.880]  不可能站起來
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.880]  好像國際戰爭一樣
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.880]  有沒有人看過國際戰爭?
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.880]  冒險者
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.880]  有國際戰爭的時候
[00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.880]  他們是不是
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.880]  可以對抗不公平?
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.880]  對抗敵人?
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880]  可以嗎?
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880]  他們不能對抗
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.880]  因為他們在對抗自己
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.880]  誰是?
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.880]  鐵甲人隊的
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.880]  舉起你的手
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.880]  鐵甲人隊
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.880]  全部是美國隊長
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.880]  美國隊長
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.880]  國際戰爭發生的時候
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.880]  他們是不是在對抗敵人?
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.880]  其實不是
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.880]  他們在對抗自己
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.880]  耶穌就這樣說
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.880]  我怎麼可以
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.880]  被魔鬼主子權力
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.880]  對抗魔鬼?
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.880]  魔鬼主子權力對抗魔鬼?
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.880]  一個分裂的房子
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.880]  對抗自己
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.880]  不可能站起來
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.880]  不可能站起來
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.880]  所以耶穌
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.880]  就說什麼?
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.880]  下一頁
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.880]  寫信的爭論
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.880]  很有趣
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.880]  這應該是耶穌
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.880]  對抗寫信
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.880]  寫信不合理
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.880]  耶穌
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.880]  就是合理
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.880]  這是我們第一點
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:57.880]  第一個比較
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.880]  我們繼續讀
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880]  我們繼續讀
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.880]  馬克四書
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.880]  我們一起讀
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880]  1,2,3
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.880]  沒有人可以進入強人的家
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.880]  並盜竊他的財物
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.880]  除非他首先對抗強人
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.880]  然後他就能盜竊他的家
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.880]  這個形容
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.880]  是有一個
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.880]  很大隻
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.880]  很強的一個人
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.880]  在他的家
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.880]  如果你想打劫他
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.880]  OK
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.880]  你想打劫他
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:32.880]  你要怎樣?
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.880]  你要先對抗強人
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.880]  誰覺得他是強人?
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.880]  誰覺得他是強人?
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.880]  誰覺得他是強人?
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.880]  Caleb?
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:43.880]  Mark?
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.880]  CY?
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.880]  你覺得你是強人?
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.880]  OK,弱人
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.880]  開玩笑
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.880]  這個形容
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:54.880]  這個故事
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.880]  耶穌說的這個故事
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.880]  你覺得強人是誰?
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.880]  強人是誰?
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.880]  誰覺得強人是耶穌?
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.880]  舉手
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.880]  誰覺得強人在這個故事
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.880]  是Satan?
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.880]  沒有人知道?
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.880]  再問一次
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.880]  Jesus 還是Satan?
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.880]  強人
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.880]  誰覺得強人是耶穌?
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.880]  舉手
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:31.880]  OK,有人覺得
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.880]  誰覺得強人是Satan?
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.880]  舉手
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.880]  OK
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]  其實呢
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.880]  在這個故事
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.880]  強人是誰?
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.880]  是誰?你覺得
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.880]  是我?
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.880]  其實是Satan
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.880]  OK
[00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.880]  Satan
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.880]  Satan的家是什麼?
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:59.880]  Satan的家在哪裡?
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:01.880]  在地球
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.880]  OK
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.880]  他就是地球的主人
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.880]  OK
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.880]  所以Satan是強人
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.880]  他的家就是地球
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.880]  OK
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.880]  他被地球壓下來
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.880]  OK
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.880]  那麼耶穌是誰?
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.880]  耶穌是強人的一方
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.880]  你會看到下一頁
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.880]  強人的一方
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.880]  然後他會大力地打破家
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.880]  我們看到兩個比較
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.880]  第一
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.880]  他就說
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.880]  他更強
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.880]  Satan更強
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.880]  他更有力量
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.880]  撒旦是有能力的
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.880]  但是耶穌更強
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.880]  Jesus更強
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.880]  他可以強人
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.880]  第二
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.880]  Satan擁有地球
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.880]  但是耶穌呢
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.880]  One day
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.880]  He has all authority
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.880]  And he will take back
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.880]  What is his own
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.880]  Jesus is stronger
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.880]  Jesus has all authority
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.880]  And he will plunder
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.880]  我們看Revelation 20
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.880]  One day Satan will be defeated once and for all
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.880]  And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.880]  Where the beast and the false prophet has been thrown
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.880]  False prophet is the
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.880]  Antichrist
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.880]  They will be tormented day and night forever and ever
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.880]  有一天
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.880]  耶穌會Fully defeat Satan
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.880]  Fully defeat Satan
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.880]  So
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.880]  We see that Jesus is stronger than Satan
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.880]  Jesus has all authority
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.880]  And one day he will take back what is his
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.880]  And he will make a new heaven and a new earth
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.880]  There is a last part of this scripture that we need to see
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.880]  我們繼續讀Mark chapter 4
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:17.880]  我們一起讀
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.880]  1,2,3
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.880]  I say to you
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.880]  All sins will be forgiven
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.880]  Of the children of man
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.880]  And whatever blasphemes they utter
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.880]  But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.880]  Never has forgiveness
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.880]  But is guilty of eternal sin
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.880]  For what they were saying
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.880]  He has an unclean spirit
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.880]  為什麼
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.880]  耶穌說什麼
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.880]  If you blaspheme against the Holy Spirit
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.880]  You will not be forgiven
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.880]  為什麼
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.880]  為什麼
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.880]  The scribes
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.880]  What Jesus was saying here
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.880]  Is the scribes they knew who Jesus was
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:11.880]  They knew Jesus was a man of God
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.880]  Yet in their heart
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.880]  Instead of agreeing
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.880]  That Jesus was a man of God
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.880]  They chose to say that
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.880]  The Holy Spirit was a liar
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.880]  The Holy Spirit is lying
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.880]  And saying that he has an unclean spirit
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:35.880]  So they are speaking against the Holy Spirit
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:38.880]  And that is an unforgivable thing
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.880]  He is saying
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.880]  The scribes were saying that the Holy Spirit is wrong
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.880]  The scribes themselves
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.880]  Had possibly had a feeling
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.880]  That this is not an unclean spirit
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.880]  This is a man of God
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:02.880]  And yet they chose to say that the Holy Spirit is lying
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.880]  And when we do that
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.880]  It is an unforgivable thing
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.880]  So the last comparison is this
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.880]  The scribes were not logical
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.880]  And Jesus is logical
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.880]  The scribes were not truthful
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:22.880]  But Jesus is
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.880]  Jesus is the truth
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.880]  The scribes were not logical
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.880]  They tried to defeat Jesus
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.880]  Using their non-logic
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.880]  They tried to cast Jesus as a demon
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:45.880]  When in fact he is the Lord of Lords
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.880]  So finally we see this
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.880]  Firstly, in terms of spiritual knowledge
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.880]  Jesus is greater than the scribes
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.880]  He is logical and he is truthful
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.880]  In terms of spiritual power
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.880]  Jesus is greater than Satan
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.880]  He is stronger and he is more powerful
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.880]  And he has all authority
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.880]  And one day he will make a new heaven
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.880]  And a new earth
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.880]  So that is why in conclusion
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:22.880]  Jesus is Lord over the spiritual realm
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:28.880]  Lord over the spiritual realm
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.880]  So what should our response be?
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.880]  What should our response be?
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.880]  Knowing about these demons
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.880]  The first thing is to beware
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.880]  Beware of what?
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.880]  That there is a spiritual realm
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.880]  Demons do exist
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.880]  Satan is real
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.880]  They are powerful
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.880]  We should beware
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.880]  Understand that there is a spiritual realm
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.880]  The second thing we need to do
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.880]  Is to believe
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880]  What do we need to believe?
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.880]  We need to believe that Jesus is Lord over all things
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.880]  He is stronger
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.880]  He has all authority
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.880]  One day he will make everything new
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.880]  He will judge the earth
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.880]  He will throw Satan and the Antichrist into hell
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.880]  And they will be punished forever and ever
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.880]  So, first, we should beware
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.880]  Second, we should believe
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:42.880]  The third thing is we need to be equipped
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.880]  How do we defend ourselves?
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.880]  How do we defend ourselves?
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:56.880]  We have been given the truth, the Bible
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.880]  We need to know the truth
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:05.880]  The Bible teaches us to know Jesus, to know God
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.880]  To know what the truth is
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.880]  Do not be deceived by Satan
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880]  He has power
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.880]  He can deceive us
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:20.880]  So we encourage you to be spiritual
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.880]  To know Jesus, to read the Bible
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.880]  Prepare ourselves, know the truth
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.880]  Have the armor of God, the belt of truth
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.880]  And then also, we need to rely on the Holy Spirit
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.880]  To help us discern what is right and wrong
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.880]  我們依賴聖靈
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.880]  To help us know what is right and wrong
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.880]  What is from God
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.880]  What is from the enemy
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:53.880]  We need to rely on the Holy Spirit
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.880]  And how also can we be equipped?
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.880]  By coming to our church, our community
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.880]  God has given us this body of Christ
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:10.880]  That we can help and prepare each other
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.880]  When we have Jesus
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.880]  As the next slide says
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.880]  When we have Jesus, we have no fear
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:25.880]  Because Jesus is Lord over the spiritual realm
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.880]  Jesus is Lord over the spiritual realm
