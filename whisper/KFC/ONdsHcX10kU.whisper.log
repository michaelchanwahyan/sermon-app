[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Alright, how's everybody tonight?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Excellent.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.840]   Are you guys disgusted with life?
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.640]   This is apparently the topic that's been assigned to me.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.080]   Today's topic is disgusted with life, Ezekiel chapter 2.
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.400]   And we've been talking about several main themes that sort of appear within this book.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.640]   The first is vanity.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.920]   Pastor Michelle talked about that, this word, habal.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.960]   It's like she gave us this metaphor, we're just grasping for something, we're just grasping
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.080]   for air.
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.780]   And there's nothing, it's futile, it's lacking substance, pointlets.
[00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.400]   It's like the wind or vapor.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.980]   And then Pastor John last week continued and explained more to us, right?
[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.180]   That nothing seems to change.
[00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.640]   This life, what's good about it?
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.220]   Nothing seems to change.
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.480]   Nothing satisfies.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.740]   Nothing is new under the sun.
[00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.380]   Everything, nothing is understood.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.380]   There's vanity, it's pointless.
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.220]   There's no meaning.
[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.320]   And then this concept of nothing new under the sun.
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.740]   This preacher, it's going through a discussion on how do I find meaning in life, in this
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.380]   life on earth.
[00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.460]   That's what it means.
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.980]   Nothing new under the sun.
[00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.340]   And he continues in chapter 2 and he talks about several things that we're gonna talk
[00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.340]   about tonight.
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.220]   And the first is pleasure is meaningless.
[00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.940]   Wisdom is meaningless.
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.800]   And work is meaningless.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.780]   And Pastor, not Pastor, our administrator, Bonnie read to us.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.640]   Yeah, future, future.
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.640]   There's meaning in this world.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.640]   Bonnie read to us the scripture.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.780]   And the first thing that the preacher talks about is behold, he goes through laughter.
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.780]   It's mad.
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.720]   Pleasure, what use is it?
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.820]   He searched for how to fill his heart with wine, right?
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.240]   And how, you know, he even tried foolishness, right?
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.240]   All these things.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.880]   He tried experiences.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.960]   He wanted to experience things in life.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.460]   I work with a lot of young people, right?
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.460]   And these young people, they grow up and they want to experience life, right?
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.060]   They want to do the fun things.
[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.240]   They want to do the maybe not so good things.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.920]   They've all been there.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.680]   They want to experience life.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.760]   They want to experience pleasure, laughter, wine.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.240]   This preacher talks about wine, maybe drunkenness.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.680]   He wants to experience it.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.680]   And then foolishness.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.320]   He even tries foolishness.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.040]   And I also really like experiences, especially sporting experiences.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.320]   And this next picture, some of you might be in this picture, next picture after that.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.340]   I was visiting UK before all this COVID stuff was happening.
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.480]   And I went to a Manchester United game.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.280]   And then after that, I met up with Pastor John and we went to another game.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.980]   And I was like, wow, this is such a great experiences.
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.720]   And on the way, we did some work.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.620]   You know, we met up with some students.
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.160]   We had some tea.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.760]   We had such a great experience.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.840]   You know, Pastor John took me to this game.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.520]   It was a great experience.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.080]   But what do I have at the end of it?
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.920]   What do I have at the end of it?
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.400]   My team lost Manchester United.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   They lost.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.240]   I spent all this money to sit front row.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.200]   Why are you cheering?
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.860]   We should be in the Chinese congregation.
[00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.140]   My team, I spent all this money to sit behind, not beside, behind the goalie, you know, front
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.540]   row.
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.140]   And my team lost.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.860]   And there was, you know, the opposing team and they, you know, sort of fence off the
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.080]   opposing team and the home team.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.220]   And the opposing team was like rattling the gate and everything and things were going
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.220]   crazy.
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.720]   You know, you know, Jesus was going to come soon, you know, like at that game, like it
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.500]   was, it was going to go bananas.
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.380]   My team lost.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.820]   And then me and Pastor John went to this game.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.820]   Fantastic time.
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.060]   What do we have to show for it?
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.700]   Maybe a photo of our great experience.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.180]   Vanity.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.900]   Pointless.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.580]   That's what this preacher is saying.
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.120]   Experiences, they only last for a moment.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:10.180]   He continues this preacher and says that he's done great works, great, great, amazing houses,
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.460]   gardens, fruit trees, pools, forests.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.460]   Wow.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.460]   Amazing.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.900]   Can you imagine all these things?
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.620]   This is like Sim City, right?
[00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.180]   Just like maybe he was playing Sim City.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.140]   You guys remember that game Sim City where you create a city, roller coasters, and maybe
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.500]   he was doing this game.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.620]   But he also says that this is vanity.
[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.740]   Accomplishments don't satisfy.
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.140]   Accomplishments don't satisfy.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.780]   Back in Toronto, I competed for many years in this race.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.440]   Have you guys heard of Amazing Race before?
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.140]   This is sort of called like a, within the city, it's called City Chase.
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.860]   And for many years, we competed.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.580]   And for like the first couple years, we competed and we only came like third or fourth.
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.460]   And then we started finding the strategy of how to win.
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.860]   And we came in first like many years.
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.180]   And when I achieved that, I still remember, you know, my friend posted.
[00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:25.020]   He was like, "At last, all this hard work is worthwhile."
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.300]   And I remember texting my mom, "Hey, I came first."
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.540]   And she's like, "Love you.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.880]   Proud of you."
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.620]   And I'm like, "Yeah, great.
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.780]   I'm first.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.260]   Now what?
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.260]   Now what?"
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.580]   And you get first again and get first again.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.180]   And now what?
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.380]   And then your bones and joints are, you know, tired and broken.
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.460]   Your body's broken.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.940]   What next?
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:01.620]   Andre Agassi, eight-time Grand Slam tennis winner.
[00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.540]   He won the Wimbledon here.
[00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.340]   He still had long hair.
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.900]   And he says this, "Now that I've won a slam, I know something very few people on earth
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.460]   are permitted to know.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.900]   A win doesn't feel as good as a loss feels bad.
[00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.180]   And the good feeling doesn't last long, as long as the bad, not even close.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:33.180]   The goal line moved to achieving the number one ranking and lastly, the 1996 gold medal."
[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.980]   Yet he never felt like it was enough.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.620]   He says this, "I find it surreal, then perfectly normal.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.820]   I'm struck by how fast the surreal becomes the norm.
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:53.820]   I marvel at how unexciting it is to be famous, how mundane famous people are.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.260]   They're confused, uncertain, insecure, and often hate what they do.
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:06.020]   It's something we always hear, like the old adage that money can't buy happiness, but
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:12.820]   we never believe it until we see it ourselves."
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:21.980]   Andre Agassi won millions of dollars, won eight Grand Slams, but he says, "The good
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:29.180]   feeling doesn't last as long as the bad feeling."
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:36.900]   The surreal becomes norm, becomes the norm so quickly.
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.220]   And this is what our preacher is saying.
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.900]   He's tried experience, he's tried pleasure.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:47.540]   The next thing he tries, well, he buys a lot of male and female slaves.
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.260]   He has a lot of possessions, right?
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.260]   And then what does he do?
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.540]   He gathers a lot of concubines, right?
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:03.180]   He's gathered silver, gold, male servants, possessions, and he's gathered concubines.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.260]   He tries what?
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:10.900]   The next thing he tries to find meaning in life is possessions.
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.760]   Possessions.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.300]   What do you guys like to possess?
[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.140]   What do you guys like to hold?
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.420]   Is it football jerseys?
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.020]   Is it, you know, shoes, Kobe shoes?
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.620]   Is it guitars?
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.340]   Is it medical equipment?
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.340]   I don't know.
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.340]   I'm just looking at Mel.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:36.420]   I'm just thinking what she collects.
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:43.060]   Medical equipment.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.900]   Possessions don't satisfy.
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.740]   Lushly desires don't satisfy.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.620]   We get disappointed in relationships.
[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.820]   Relationships sometimes don't last.
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:01.980]   Sometimes it's not a happy ever after.
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.980]   King Solomon is a great example of this.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:11.220]   Now the reason why a lot of people think King Solomon wrote this book is because a lot of
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.380]   this chapter too, right?
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.700]   He's possessed everything.
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.900]   He's tried everything, right?
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:23.000]   King Solomon, known for his wisdom.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.740]   He prayed, "God, I'm so young.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.940]   I can't do this job.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.420]   I can't be king.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.660]   God, can you help me?"
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.660]   And what does God do?
[00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:39.060]   God grants him the wisdom to do the thing that he's called him to do.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.340]   And yet Solomon was also blessed with money.
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.620]   Do you know how much money he actually had?
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.140]   Let's look at it.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:55.180]   Every year, King Solomon received over 25 tons of gold in addition to taxes paid by
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.180]   merchants.
[00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:01.340]   That's around 666 talents of gold.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.020]   How much gold is that?
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.620]   Is anybody wearing 66 talents of gold?
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.620]   No?
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.620]   Nobody?
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.620]   Okay.
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:12.620]   Even the queen, I think, is wearing it right now.
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:14.020]   Okay.
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:19.260]   One talent of gold is worth, next slide, 75 pounds.
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.260]   And 75 pounds, okay?
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:27.940]   So one talent of gold in today's worth is around $1.6 million.
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.040]   $1.6 million.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.620]   So how many talents of gold did he receive yearly?
[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:40.340]   666 talents of gold.
[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.300]   So how much money did he usually make?
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.780]   Around 1.1 billion a year.
[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.020]   Does anybody make $1.1 billion here?
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.020]   Is Hank here?
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.020]   Is Hank here?
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.020]   No?
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.020]   Hank's not here?
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.020]   He skipped this talk.
[00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.020]   Yeah, he didn't want to raise his hand.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:11:58.020]   I'm joking.
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:59.020]   His wife is here.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.020]   Okay.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:07.020]   I think it's USD.
[00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.020]   USD.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.580]   1.1 billion.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.140]   And he reigned for how many years?
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.580]   Around 40 years.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.500]   Can you imagine how rich that was?
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.580]   That's crazy rich.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.080]   What do you do with so much gold?
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.860]   You just like sleep in it.
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.540]   I think Mayweather has a toilet, you know, that's golden.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.540]   Right?
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:36.220]   Maybe that's what Solomon did, had like golden toilet bowls, right?
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.980]   So he had all the money in the world.
[00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.940]   He had all the wisdom in the world.
[00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.460]   And because of that, he was so famous, people came to visit him.
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:46.180]   "Oh, I want to see Solomon, you know, perform."
[00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.220]   You know, like it was like a wisdom show.
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.340]   It was not a magic show.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.700]   It was a wisdom show.
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.700]   Right?
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.660]   In addition to that, what did he try?
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.180]   He tried relationships.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.540]   Oh, did he try relationships.
[00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:05.100]   Anybody have 700 wives and 300 concubines here?
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.020]   No, once enough, Pastor John says.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:15.540]   700 wives and 300 concubines.
[00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.660]   Man, those were busy nights, huh?
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.660]   Very busy nights.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.540]   How do you set up a schedule, you know?
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.140]   We have enough problems with our preaching schedule.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.740]   How do you set a schedule like this?
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.300]   Anyways, all right.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.060]   Solomon O'Solomon.
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.740]   And so, let's see what the preacher says here.
[00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.060]   So he sort of concludes here, this first part of his talk.
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.620]   "So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:52.960]   Also my wisdom remained with me and whatever my eyes desired, I did not keep from them.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.220]   I kept from my heart no pleasure.
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:03.020]   My heart found pleasure in all my toil and this was my reward for all my toil.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:09.820]   Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil or the work that I had expended
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.180]   on doing it and behold, all was vanity.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.820]   A striving after the wind.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.860]   There was nothing to be gained under the sun."
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:31.660]   Man, he tried so hard to find meaning in life, in experiences, in pleasure, in possessions,
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:36.420]   in relationships, in fame, in all those fleshly desires.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:43.700]   And at the end of it, he considered, imagine himself sitting at the beach, looking at the
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.460]   horizon.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.300]   What have I done?
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.820]   And he's like, "I've done nothing.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.300]   Nothing."
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:59.780]   Jim Carrey, one of my favorite actors, he says this, "I think everybody should get rich
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:09.260]   and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it's not the answer.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.420]   That it's not the answer."
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.620]   So he tried pleasure.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.460]   He tried pleasure.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.860]   What have you tried to find the meaning of life in?
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.940]   What kind of pleasure?
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.140]   Is it experiences?
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.100]   Is it accomplishments?
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.220]   Is it possessions?
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.260]   Is it fleshly desires?
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.920]   Where has it led you?
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:44.400]   After an endless chasing, like endless chasing for the next iPhone.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.640]   You get it.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.600]   And then it's like, "Oh, it's nice."
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.440]   For a week.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.480]   And then it's like, "When's the next one coming out?"
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:55.120]   And then you spend another, how much is it now?
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.120]   9,000?
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   10,000?
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.680]   If you get pro or something?
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:04.040]   Yeah, have fun.
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:10.960]   The second reason why he's disgusted with life, he says wisdom is meaningless.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.080]   Wisdom is meaningless.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:15.240]   Let's continue to read.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.120]   So I turned to consider wisdom and madness and fully or foolishness.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.480]   For what can a man do who comes after the king?
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.860]   Only what has already been done.
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:32.480]   Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in fully.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.360]   As there is more gain in light than in darkness.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.840]   The wise person has his eyes in his head.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.080]   But a fool walks in darkness.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.240]   Yet I perceived that the same event happens to all of them.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:53.840]   Then I said in my heart, "What happens to the fool will also happen to me also."
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:57.840]   Why then have I been so very wise?
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.940]   So I said in my heart that all this is also vanity.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:09.200]   For of the wise, as of the fool, there is no enduring remembrance.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   Seeing that in the days to come, all will have been long forgotten.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.160]   So the preacher continues and says, he tries wisdom.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.680]   And he's thinking about, yeah, wisdom, it's good.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.760]   I live a wise life.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.500]   And he says, oh, it's good, because the wise, they have their eyes and their heads.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.220]   The fools, they're sort of blind.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.740]   They don't know where they're walking.
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.340]   Have you guys been hiking before or been on vacation?
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:48.480]   And somebody has led this trip or this hike, and they have no idea where they're going.
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.920]   Who enjoys it?
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.580]   Who enjoys that sense of adventure?
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.620]   Anybody enjoy it?
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:57.140]   No, you feel like you have no idea.
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.940]   You feel like you've lost your sense of purpose.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.100]   You feel like you're lost.
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.460]   This is what Solomon is saying.
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.940]   The wise, they could see.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.500]   They can know exactly where they're going.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.700]   The fools, they're just blindly bumping into things.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.780]   They don't know where they're going.
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:22.100]   But at the end of it all, what happens to both of them?
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.580]   Both of them have the same result.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:33.100]   Death makes life meaningless.
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.540]   Both have the same fate.
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:40.900]   Both will not be remembered long.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:44.380]   And so he's like, wisdom.
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.460]   I think I prefer wisdom over foolishness.
[00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:54.300]   But at the end of the day, we have the same fate.
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:59.500]   And that's what he says makes it meaningless.
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.980]   Who are some people you remember in history?
[00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:03.980]   Name some out.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.540]   Some people you remember in history.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.140]   Alexander the Great.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.180]   Colby Bryan.
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:14.460]   Who else?
[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.220]   Abraham Lincoln.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.620]   Winston Churchill.
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.180]   All these people are great.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:26.660]   They're remembered for their basketball playing, their conquering, their leadership.
[00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:34.060]   But yet there's all these other people that were fools or very evil, and yet we still
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.580]   remember their names as well.
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:45.420]   And so this is why the preacher says wisdom is meaningless.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:51.460]   The great people, the good people, they die.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.460]   The evil, the dumb people, they also die.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.580]   How long we remember their name, who knows?
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:02.260]   Who knows?
[00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:04.300]   Pleasure is meaningless.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.540]   Wisdom is meaningless.
[00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.660]   The third thing he talks about is work.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.300]   Who loves their work?
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.460]   I know Joseph loves their work, his work.
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.580]   Joseph loves his work.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.700]   Michelle loves his work.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.700]   What do you do, sir?
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.300]   I'm a jewelry designer.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.180]   Jewelry designer, very good.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:24.220]   He loves his work.
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:29.020]   Let's see what the preacher says about work.
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:35.420]   I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to the
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.100]   man who will come after me.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:44.300]   And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool, yet he will be the master of all of
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:48.300]   which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun.
[00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:53.860]   This also is vanity.
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:21:00.860]   What's the point when I work so hard, I design all that jewelry, I design all those interior
[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:07.700]   buildings, when I build into all these people at church, what's the point?
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:15.060]   All this work, all this money that I've saved, when it just goes to the person after me.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:23.620]   And who knows whether the person after me will be a fool or a wise person.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.640]   You don't know what they're going to do with their money.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.740]   What is the best biblical example of this?
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.940]   What's the best biblical example of this?
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:37.860]   The prodigal son.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:43.260]   The prodigal son, very disrespectfully, when his dad was still alive, was like, "Give me
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.500]   my inheritance.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.620]   Give me my inheritance.
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:48.700]   Give me a third of all you own."
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:53.420]   Because he was the younger son, the elder son got two thirds, double portion, if you
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.800]   know the Old Testament.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:56.800]   And what does he do?
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.840]   He's like, "Yeah, I'm going to invest it in Bitcoin."
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.160]   And then it just plummets.
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.360]   And then he wastes it on wild living.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:11.400]   Woo, you know?
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.600]   And then what happens?
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.600]   He's broke.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:15.600]   Right?
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:23.160]   Bitcoin fell down and all his money he spent doing woo, just took all his money.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.320]   And he was left with the pigs.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.320]   Right?
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.120]   He was just like, "Hey, pal, how you doing?"
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.760]   He had some pets.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:38.720]   And that's when he realized, "I got to go back to my father.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   He still can hire me to be his servant."
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.960]   Right?
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.240]   And that's what the preacher is saying.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:54.960]   What's the point of storing up all this money when you don't know who it's going to go to?
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:01.720]   And whether this person could be your children would be wise or fools.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   Right?
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.000]   And so he also says this, "Work is grief and pain.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.080]   Even at night, our minds do not rest."
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.840]   Work is vanity.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.000]   Because even when we're asleep, we can't even sleep.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.360]   We're just constantly working.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.880]   We're constantly thinking about work.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.400]   Joseph loves to think about work.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.800]   That's how he gets to sleep.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.800]   He told me.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.320]   I'm not putting words in his mouth.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:38.760]   But work, the preacher says, "Work is pain and grief because we can't rest.
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.000]   We're constantly thinking about it."
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.760]   And so that's why he's disgusted with life.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.920]   Well, he doesn't say disgusted.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.280]   He says vanity and meaningless.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.000]   You just put a fancy title to catch your attention.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.520]   He's disgusted with life because pleasure is meaningless.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.040]   He's tried everything.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.940]   Everything he set his eyes on, he's tried.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.920]   Everything his heart has wanted, he's tried it.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.960]   But at the end of the day, it's nothing.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:13.760]   He's tried wisdom, the wise way of living.
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.200]   But at the end, we all have the same fate.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.360]   What's the point?
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.640]   He's tried work.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:25.000]   But what's the point of work and storing up treasures when you don't know where this treasure
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.680]   is going to go?
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:36.400]   He makes it seem as if life, there's no point.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.040]   We should all just give up right now.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.460]   And that's how he sets us up.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.600]   He sets it up where everything is doom and gloom.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.560]   He ends with a conclusion.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.680]   Let's read this conclusion together.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   Let's read it.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.520]   Therefore, ready, set, go.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:02.040]   Therefore is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.920]   in his toil.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.520]   This also I saw from the hand of God.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.680]   For apart from him, who can eat and who can have enjoyment?
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:18.600]   For the one who pleases him, God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:24.920]   But to the sinner, he has given the business of gathering and collecting only to give to
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.240]   the one who pleases God.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.560]   This also is vanity and a striving after the wind.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.280]   So he's been for how many chapters?
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.040]   24 chapters.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.640]   Kobe Bryant time, right?
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.120]   For 24 chapters, he's been talking about life is meaningless.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:51.520]   And then he, at the end, he throws in three verses to try and catch you off guard.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.360]   And this is what he says.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:59.280]   It's interesting because the first thing we notice is that he believes in God.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.560]   He believes in God.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.200]   And what does he believe about God?
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:13.880]   He believes that God has given us this ability to eat and drink and have satisfaction.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.560]   He has given this ability to us.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.080]   It's not random.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:27.120]   It's not just randomness.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.120]   There was a design.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.600]   There was a purpose.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.440]   Somebody allowed it to happen.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.960]   There was an intelligent designer that allowed this to happen.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.840]   And so the first thing he says, how to make the most of your life, my first point is to
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:52.360]   recognize that God has given us the ability to eat and drink and find satisfaction in
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.000]   our work.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.040]   And I wanna invite Winnie and Ricky to come up and share about how they have experienced
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:09.640]   God and how God has given them the ability to eat and drink and find satisfaction.
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.640]   Let's give them a hand.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.160]   - Hi.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:24.840]   So we are here to share about how good it is to be able to eat and drink.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.000]   And we like eating, don't we?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   We like eating.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.720]   And just about two months ago, we actually went to a staycation, staying in this hotel
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   in May.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:40.560]   And throughout the two days in the hotel, we did nothing, just eating, eating, and eating.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.920]   Yeah, it's so enjoyable.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.160]   And God allowed us to do that.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:51.240]   And it's amazing because at that time, we didn't know that something is happening.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.760]   We have no idea.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.680]   And we do know that very soon, we are going to have another staycation, just a different
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   type of staycation.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:05.240]   So it all happened on the 26th of June.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.640]   It was a Sunday evening.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.840]   Our family had a family dinner with Tony's family, and we totally enjoyed it.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:15.440]   It was late in the night when we partied.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:19.120]   And on the way to the car park, I was walking behind him.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.960]   And when I looked at him, he walked as if he's pretty tired.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:28.520]   He's as if he wasn't lifting his left leg up properly.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.480]   So we asked him, and he said, "I have no problem.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.040]   I'm fine."
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.680]   So we didn't let him drive.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.400]   Our son Chester drove home.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.640]   But when we arrived at home, he actually threw up, right?
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.560]   He threw up a little bit.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:43.560]   And then what did he say?
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.680]   He said, "Oh, I'm having travel sickness because I'm used to be the driver.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.400]   I'm not used to sitting at the back."
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:56.040]   So he was complaining about the driving skills of his son.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.040]   So we brushed it aside.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:59.640]   We brushed it aside, and we went home.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.480]   And of course, I was the first one to grab the bathroom.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   I took a bath.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.920]   I changed into my pajamas, and I sat there.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.840]   It was like 10 to 15 minutes before the clock strikes 12, and that would be my serbath Monday.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.640]   And I'm totally relaxed, enjoying my time there, winding down.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.720]   And then he went into the bathroom to take a bath.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:26.880]   And out of the blue, I got this idea in my head, popped him up suddenly, and I said,
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.320]   "I should take him to the hospital for a checkup."
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:36.200]   And strange enough, as lazy as I am, I got up onto my feet.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.720]   I get myself changed even before he finished his bath.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.400]   And when he came out from the bathroom, I said, "I'm taking you to the hospital for
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   a check now."
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.400]   And he said, "Why?
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.400]   I have no problem."
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.640]   So, we went to the hospital.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:53.500]   It was like 10 minutes past midnight.
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:59.400]   We were in the private hospital, and I explained my concern.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:04.160]   And the doctor checked on him, examined him, and the doctor said, "Whoa, he's fine.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.440]   He has no problem."
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:15.200]   But I cannot preclude that he might have had a minor stroke earlier on when he threw up.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:23.640]   So, if you are keen to have a brain scan, because I asked for a brain scan, yeah, you
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.000]   can do it, but it's not worth doing it right now.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   You can wait till the morning.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   It's not urgent.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.520]   He might have recovered by himself already, this minor stroke, because he's not perfectly
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.520]   okay.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.520]   But it's good to find out whether he has had a minor stroke.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.520]   So he said, "Okay, I'm going home."
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:39.760]   I said, "No, you're not going home.
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.760]   You're staying here in the hospital.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:44.440]   And tomorrow morning, you're going to get a scan."
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:49.000]   So in the morning, the nurses asked him, "Why are you hospitalized, and what did you tell
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   them?"
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.200]   And I told her that my family was watching queer behavior, queer manner.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.280]   So the nurse said, "I don't think so.
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.280]   You are all okay.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.520]   You are normal.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.680]   So I don't understand why you are here."
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.120]   Yeah, the nurse said he's all right.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:13.080]   And then a neurologist came, actually a specialist came, and examined all over again.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:18.920]   And he also considered that he's pretty normal, absolutely okay.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.440]   So I was pressing and pressing for a brain scan.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:27.740]   But since he's a normal patient, his scanning was kept being deferred.
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:33.400]   And it wasn't until 21 minutes past six, I think, in the evening, that he started to
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.480]   go into that room for a scan.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.240]   And because I kept pressing to see the doctor, so the doctor came up to see me, it was like
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.880]   6.40.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.240]   He was still in the room.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:50.440]   MRI report wasn't out yet, but the doctor invited me to go and sit in front of a computer
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.120]   and look at the scan real time.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.940]   And I saw this image.
[00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.160]   So can you interpret that?
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:05.480]   Actually, all that gray band over that little element, instead of a walnut in the skull,
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.560]   were blood.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:13.960]   On the right, it was two, according to the report afterwards, on the right, the belt
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.660]   measures 2.44 cm.
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.240]   On the left, the belt measures 1.41 cm.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.040]   And it's like a helmet all around his head.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:28.900]   And if you look at the front scan, actually, the blood went all down to the eyebrow.
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:37.280]   So his brain was like being filled up by blood, taking up at least 25 to 30% of the space
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:39.040]   of his original size.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.280]   So that was what happened.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.160]   I feel really sorry for this poor neurologist, because in the morning, on a Monday morning,
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:50.840]   he went into the hospital, he ran into this patient who is perfectly normal and okay.
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.880]   And then he has a paranoid wife who kept pressing for an MRI scan.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.480]   This wife is paranoid.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.920]   But by the evening, when she looked at this scan, she didn't even raise her eyebrow.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.880]   She said, "Oh, there's a lot of blood."
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.120]   And she's insanely calm.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:11.760]   So he decided to do something to help me realize the significance of the situation.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.880]   And he said, "Does he have any other family members?"
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.880]   "Yeah."
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   He got two sons.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.480]   "Are they in Hong Kong?"
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   "Yeah."
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.480]   "Should I ask them to come over?"
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   "Of course."
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.480]   Okay, rush our sons over.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.880]   That's his instruction that he need an operation.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:34.400]   So I think it was around seven, he came up back to the ward.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.280]   And he looked a little bit perplexed.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.320]   "Got blood in my brain?
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   A lot?"
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.400]   Yeah, a lot.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:50.840]   And so I sent the photo over to my sons, because the MRI report is actually not yet even printed.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.280]   I just took a picture, a photo from the screen monitor.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.240]   And my son Ryan actually sent it over to his doctor friends.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.160]   And the doctor friends says, "Every minute counts.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.160]   Every minute counts.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.840]   This hospital is so slow.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.440]   You immediately rush him over to casualty in a public hospital and get the surgery done
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.200]   immediately to remove the blood."
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.840]   And I said, "Son, hold on.
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.800]   While we're waiting for the papers to be discharged, let me make a call."
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:24.480]   So I called our friend who is the parent of Chester, our eldest son, one of his best friends
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.480]   in school.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.520]   And we called that parent.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.800]   And we just made it in time, because he was a professor, head of a heart center in Bat
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.160]   Tibbs Hospital.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.280]   He was about to go into operation theater himself.
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.720]   We just catch him in time.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   So he immediately...
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.720]   - Postponed it.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:43.720]   - Yeah.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.760]   He just make all the arrangements.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:48.840]   In 20 minutes, he gave me a call.
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:49.840]   He has everything.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.200]   Everything is done.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.960]   So it's so smooth.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   It's so smooth.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:54.960]   And there's no worries.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:01.320]   Because if he has gone into the theater, then we will be running around asking for surgeons
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:03.000]   and so on and so forth.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.160]   So anyway, that's what happened that night in around, I think, 8 o'clock or so, a little
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   bit past 8.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   - 8 o'clock, okay.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:17.880]   - The director of ICU of Bat Tibbs Hospital rushed over.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:26.080]   And he was here to escort him on an ambulance to the hospital on the current site for surgery.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:32.320]   And when he arrived, we as a family was actually standing around the bed, chatting.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.800]   And he practically jumped.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.320]   Maybe not as Bonnie.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.320]   He actually...
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.840]   It made him jump.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.600]   He totally jumped up and said, "Oh my goodness, this is a patient?
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.760]   You really scared me.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.000]   Why are you not lying on the bed?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.400]   This is very dangerous.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   This is something very dangerous to do.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.240]   Please, please, please, immediately get back onto the bed and lie down, not sit down.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.960]   And from this moment onward, you're not to lay your feet onto the ground again.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.400]   And even when the ambulance come, we're going to transfer you through a stretcher.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.360]   You should not move at all," he said.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.840]   You should not move at all.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:14.200]   But, well, he has been moving around for a long time, okay?
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.200]   With all those blood in his head.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.320]   And then he set up the things and he measured the blood pressure.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.320]   Let's check on his memory, see whether he's okay.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.200]   I think it's about more than...
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.200]   Greater than 180.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.200]   His blood pressure is very high.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   Blood pressure was over 180.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:28.200]   Yeah, but I don't feel any dizziness.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.200]   I feel okay.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   There is no numbness.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   There is no headache.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   Everything is normal.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   Any headache?
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   No headache.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   Any dizziness?
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   Anything numb?
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   No.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.200]   He is very normal.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:51.920]   So just think of anyone with a blood pressure of over 180, yeah, and he's still normal.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.360]   And the doctor explained that the high blood pressure was result because of super high
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.960]   pressure inside the skull because of all those blood.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:07.360]   Anyway, so we got onto the ambulance and let's check on his memory again.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.320]   Who did the most talking on the ambulance?
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:15.640]   On the journey from Singapore Hospital to the Petro-Circuital, the consultant of the
[00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:23.240]   ICU of Petro-Circuital just together with me in the ambulance, I talked with him over
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.240]   the...
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.720]   On another journey and I do all the...
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.080]   I do most of the talking.
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.080]   He was...
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.080]   He could not stop talking.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.360]   He was talking and talking, chatting and chatting throughout.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.360]   With the doctor.
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.680]   And he answered phones and texted and...
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.520]   Because a lot of people, Sister and Brothers in Church, are horrified at the news and people
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.520]   are asking me, "Is this alert?
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.520]   Is this conscious?"
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.680]   It's not just alert and conscious, it was talking and talking.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.160]   And he was very jolly, actually.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.400]   So we arrived at the hospital, get everything checked and...
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:59.440]   The doctor actually asked what's the cause of that blood, the bleeding.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.360]   And he asked him, "Have you hit your head in the past week?"
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.240]   We said, "No, definitely not."
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:07.440]   "How about in the past two or three weeks?"
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.200]   We said, "No, definitely not."
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.520]   He said, "No, it's impossible.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:15.920]   There must be caused by some hitting on the head."
[00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:21.320]   And eventually we realised it was actually two long months ago, not two to three weeks
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.320]   ago.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.320]   Two months ago, yeah.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:25.520]   What happened on the 29th of April?
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:34.040]   In the afternoon, I drove my car out of the car park of the PP, particular place.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.920]   And I collided with the tail of the Norway.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.660]   The Norway is coming down, I'm waking up.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:47.400]   So it is quite lucky for me, or thanks God, we don't have head-to-head condition.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.520]   Otherwise, the consequences cannot be imagined.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.900]   But the airbags, both airbags actually popped out.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.360]   So the force was strong.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:01.720]   But he said he's not hurt.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:02.840]   And we did our part.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.040]   We forced him to go to the hospital for a checkup.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.960]   And the hospital checked him over.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.880]   And the hospital released him and said he is fine.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.740]   And he's actually fine.
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:20.720]   If every minute counts, I counted roughly, it was about 85,200 minutes has passed.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:24.880]   And he was running around carrying those blood in his brain.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:30.520]   And we went to a staycation, eating and eating and drinking, allowed by God, enjoying life.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.880]   He did a lot of things those two weeks.
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:39.880]   And there were, according to the doctor, there were bleeding on various locations throughout
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.880]   those two months.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:50.200]   Anyway, so the next photo I want to show you is the photo we took just the very moment
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.480]   before he went into the surgery room.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:57.680]   So we were allowed to go into the ICU to see him two by two.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.200]   So that's why we took pictures two by two.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.840]   And I lay down on him and prayed for him.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:09.160]   And then I hope you agree with me that do you see panic in our eyes?
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.600]   Do you see worries in our eyes?
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.800]   We are actually smiling.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:17.400]   And when I show this photo to one of the sister in my clan, she actually said, it looked more
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:21.360]   like you're going into a delivery room about to deliver a baby.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:27.040]   I praised the Lord for giving us that supernatural peace.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.400]   It's absolutely supernatural peace.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.000]   Are you afraid at that moment?
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.320]   I wasn't afraid.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.280]   And then he went into the operation theatre.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:43.480]   We went downstairs to wait for the surgery to be done.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:49.000]   A lot of loving brothers and sisters did not sleep that night lifting us up in prayers
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.320]   because the surgery was started like 15 minutes past midnight.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:00.400]   And Bella actually called me and then she said, how come you sounded a lot calmer than
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   I do?
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.640]   So because we are not afraid, we really are not afraid.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.160]   Why am I not afraid?
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:14.120]   When I look at that much blood in the brain, I know that it was God who has sustained him
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.480]   over the past two months.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:21.640]   If God has sustained him over the past two months, why should he not sustain him on this
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:22.640]   day?
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   Why?
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.120]   I cannot think of a reason why.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:28.560]   And if God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.040]   Yeah, thanks.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:35.960]   I feel so thankful for the Lord, not just for everything going so smooth, also for the
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.240]   supernatural peace that we are experiencing.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.760]   Okay, question.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:44.880]   Why did God allow us to wait that long for this scan?
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.240]   We waited for 18 hours before the scan was done.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.880]   Guess what?
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.660]   Next slide, please.
[00:41:54.660 --> 00:42:00.720]   On that very Monday, my son was taking his pre-wedding photo on the beach with the whole
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.980]   crew.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:06.240]   So he kept testing us and asking for results of the scan, and he said he didn't even start
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.900]   to do his scan.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:14.380]   And the scan was only done by the time they finished the shooting.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:16.900]   All things work for good for those who love God.
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.420]   This really amazing grace, we really thank God.
[00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.700]   All the timing, everything were in God's hand.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:22.700]   He's sovereign.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:26.220]   He's totally sovereign, so praise the Lord.
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:36.340]   And the last photo I want to show you is the photo we took as we left the hospital five
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:37.340]   days after the surgery.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.540]   Actually, oh, can I ask you a question?
[00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:45.060]   Do you still remember what time did you send out your first text message after the surgery?
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:52.140]   When I was sent out from the surgery theater, I sent out my first message to my family.
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.220]   It is about half past seven in the morning.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:00.940]   We finished this operation three in the, 3 a.m., and four and a half hours later, this
[00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:03.660]   guy is texting his family.
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:06.860]   And in the morning, in less than 12 hours, he's eating and drinking again.
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:10.140]   He's eating and drinking in the hospital again.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:14.900]   And he could get off his bed, there's any brain damage on you.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.980]   Actually, the doctor explained that the danger of his case was that a lot of people with
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:24.380]   that much blood in their brain would have passed out, and then they never woke up again,
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.180]   they would just pass away.
[00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.020]   And another possibility was that they would probably, even after surgery, they could have
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:35.980]   brain damage because the brain stem is being pressed so much.
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.580]   But this did not happen to us.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:43.620]   And so we took a selfie as we left the hospital because my son said it really felt like a
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.620]   staycation.
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:51.380]   We have great family time over the week, a lot of family time, and I continue to water
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.740]   my plants during that week.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.660]   I bake some scones, I make tea.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.660]   People ask me whether it's a roller coaster week for me, I would say no.
[00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:10.260]   For me, I think it's a joyful week because God has revealed himself to us in our family.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:14.180]   And I think that something great, something exciting is coming our way.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.820]   I praise the Lord for that.
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.100]   And what do you have to say about this vacation?
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:28.380]   Yes, I would like to say that it's my feeling that nothing should be taken for granted.
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.540]   Nothing should be taken for granted.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.660]   So we have to praise God.
[00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:41.820]   And I also like to praise God for his mercy and protection for me and for my family.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:48.380]   And I also like to thank the church members who put me in their prayers.
[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:55.580]   I know that when I was receiving the surgery in the early morning, some of the church members
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.100]   would not sleep.
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.700]   They say prayers for me.
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:44:59.700]   A lot of people were asleep.
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:06.540]   A lot of people just praying for me until my surgery is over.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:13.060]   So here, I'd like to make my friends, I'd like to give my big thanks to them.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:16.300]   We felt very much loved by this community.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:22.900]   And while he was in the operation theater, while I was praying, some words kept popping
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:23.900]   up in my prayer.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:29.820]   And I felt that the operation theater was filled with God's glory.
[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:35.580]   And I think this thing that happened to our family is actually filled, it's actually all
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:38.500]   of us with his grace and his power and everything.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.060]   So I'm very excited.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:47.220]   I thank God that he provides, he sustains.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.860]   Eating and drinking should not be taken for granted.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:54.180]   And eating and drinking in the presence of the Lord is something so joyful.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:57.460]   It was a joyful week for us, actually.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.460]   Praise the Lord.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:03.940]   To him be the glory.
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:04.940]   - Praise the Lord.
[00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:09.220]   What an amazing testimony of just how God has been working.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:18.380]   And yes, indeed, he allows us to eat and to drink and to enjoy the things in life.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:25.580]   And the second thing that the preacher talks about is that God allows us to find contentment
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:29.140]   in our work and in pleasures.
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:40.580]   And I just want us to stand, I just want us to be reminded of three things.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:45.060]   And the first thing is that God is the one that provides for us.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:47.180]   He provides life for us.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.900]   The air we breathe, every moment that we have.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:57.460]   And not only does he provide those, he provides life, he sustains our life.
[00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:59.540]   He sustained Ricky's life.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:01.940]   He's sustaining our breath right now.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:06.260]   Jesus is the author and sustainer of our life.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:13.540]   And the last thing that the preacher talks about is that he is a God that rewards us.
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:17.700]   He rewards those that are his.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:25.740]   If a father can give good gifts to his son, how much greater is our heavenly father who
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.360]   will reward us.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.340]   Be not on this earth, but into the next life to come.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:37.580]   Let us stand and respond in a song called Jesus at the Center of It All.
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:40.160]   (gentle music)
