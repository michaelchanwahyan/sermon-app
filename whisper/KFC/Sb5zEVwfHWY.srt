1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,960
 All right, so for the last few weeks,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,600
 we've gone through 1 Timothy, the first five chapters.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,260
 So if you haven't been with us, it's okay,

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,400
 it's still online, you can go back to it.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,280
 So we've been talking about a few things.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,760
 I don't know if you remember, let's see.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,160
 What have, remember we've been upholding the truth,

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,640
 and then what else?

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,920
 To pray, to serve, to lead,

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,880
 and lastly, we also have to love.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,440
 And this week we have one,

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,400
 it's the final charge from Apostle Paul to Timothy,

14
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,220
 it is to fight.

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,880
 I mean, what are we fighting for?

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,560
 And I love how all the songs today really led us into that.

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,480
 It is fighting the good fight of faith.

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,040
 Now we probably have heard of it every now and then,

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,320
 this saying, fight the good fight of faith.

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,840
 But what is it, what does that really look like?

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,560
 So we're gonna go through that today,

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,840
 1 Timothy, chapter six.

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,560
 Now speaking of fighting, I mean,

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,840
 the most recent movie I saw on fighting was Shang-Chi.

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,000
 So we're gonna show that, put that up.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,740
 How many, how many of you have seen that movie?

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,520
 All right, good, good, good, quite a number of you,

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,320
 so I won't be spoiling it for everybody,

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,720
 I'll just spoil it for a few.

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,080
 And I mean, during, one of the WhatsApps we have seen

31
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,980
 is that a few of our people commented

32
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,900
 that one of our pastors

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,920
 looked kind of like the protagonist here.

34
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,680
 And so we got our, oh, there we go.

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,800
 I mean, we, yeah, a few of you took a few photos, so.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,080
 We got our IT team together,

37
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,000
 which is like just Bonnie, by the way, to help us do this.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
 And we also have a Tony Leung here,

39
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,480
 which is one of our deacons, you know, Tony.

40
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,840
 But, you know, I thought I wanna keep my job,

41
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,700
 so we won't put him on.

42
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,620
 So I mean, when we talk about fighting, right,

43
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,720
 these are the kind of things we're thinking about fighting.

44
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,920
 Fist, but actually from this story,

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,440
 oh, too early, too early, let's not show that yet.

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,940
 So from this, from this story, right,

47
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,200
 we wanna keep Johnny on for as long as possible.

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,280
 So from this story, actually, we see that Tony Leung

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,080
 actually gains these 10 rings,

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,680
 if you know what I'm talking about,

51
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,160
 and he gains this super power,

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,240
 and he almost becomes immortal 'cause he doesn't die.

53
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,340
 But the more power he got, the more he desired for it.

54
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,260
 Until a point when he met his wife,

55
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,420
 that's when he turned into the good guy,

56
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,220
 'cause he put down his rings, he's like,

57
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,900
 all right, I'm all for family.

58
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,180
 But then, of course, as the plot goes,

59
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,540
 his wife is then murdered, and once he's just full of rage,

60
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,380
 he puts these 10 rings back on,

61
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,660
 and he's ready for evil for evil, right?

62
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,980
 And so he has his son, Shang-Chi, now played by Johnny,

63
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,960
 but he's way too happy for this role.

64
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,440
 But I mean, if he were ever to go

65
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,060
 for a Hollywood star position, he would do well.

66
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,060
 So what we find is that he actually trains Shang-Chi,

67
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:11,300
 this Tony Leung, trains him to be an assassin.

68
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,980
 And so what we find is Shang-Chi says,

69
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,920
 no, and I'm gonna flee away from this.

70
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,120
 This kind of evilness is not what I want.

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,420
 He flees away from it, and he goes and pursues his life.

72
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,900
 That's a very different life, his own dreams.

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,820
 But eventually, of course, his dad finds him,

74
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,340
 and they have this big battle,

75
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,920
 and then he takes hold of what's really important to him.

76
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,220
 Now, what does this have to do with 1 Timothy 6?

77
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,620
 There is a lot to it, because we realize fighting

78
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,900
 is not just with our fists, but then there's three points

79
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,780
 that we can really learn from.

80
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,740
 And first, we see that it really is

81
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,060
 to flee away from what's bad.

82
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,460
 Okay, we can go to, yes.

83
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,900
 Flee away from what is bad, and then pursue what is good.

84
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,820
 And we're gonna go through what is bad, what is good.

85
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,620
 And that's to take hold of what is important.

86
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,820
 So let's go to 1 Timothy 6, verse 11 and 12, it says,

87
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,360
 "But you, man of God," this is Apostle Paul

88
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,620
 speaking to Timothy, "Flee from all this,"

89
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,620
 which we'll talk about, "and pursue righteousness,

90
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,660
 "goodness, faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.

91
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,900
 "Fight the good fight of faith.

92
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,580
 "Take hold of eternal life to which you were called."

93
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,900
 Now, all of these words, we're kind of like,

94
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,240
 okay, we get it, but so what are we doing?

95
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,700
 And basically, let's start with flee.

96
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,100
 Okay, flee from what?

97
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,340
 Now, if we look from the previous verses in a moment,

98
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,860
 we're gonna see it's talking about flee

99
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,980
 from the false teaching and love of money.

100
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,260
 Now, Paul's been going through some sort of false teaching,

101
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,520
 but every chapter has been slightly different.

102
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,420
 So what kind of false teaching is he talking about here?

103
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,480
 Now, if we read from verse three, it says,

104
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,200
 "If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree

105
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,600
 "to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ

106
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,200
 "and the godly teaching,

107
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,500
 "they're conceited and understand nothing."

108
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,980
 So we know, okay, there are these false teachers,

109
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,280
 they don't really understand, they're against Jesus, okay.

110
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,580
 So the next verse says, "They have an unhealthy interest

111
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,820
 "in controversies and quarrels about words

112
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,920
 "that result in envy, strive, malicious talk,

113
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,800
 "evil suspicions, and constant friction

114
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,980
 "between people of corrupt mind

115
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,200
 "who have been robbed of the truth

116
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,200
 "and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain."

117
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,240
 So you see, these false teacher we're mentioning here,

118
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,500
 they're against God's doctrine.

119
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,620
 Again, we're not quite sure what they are,

120
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,220
 but if we read between the lines,

121
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,320
 we really see that there are these descriptions, okay.

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
 So they have unhealthy interests,

123
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,200
 and then we see five things that are listed here.

124
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,900
 Envy, strive, malicious talk,

125
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,040
 evil suspicion, and constant friction.

126
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,960
 Now, if you look at this list, okay,

127
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,640
 what is it that this list have in common,

128
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,480
 other than unhealthy interests, which already says,

129
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,720
 what do they have in common?

130
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
 I mean, why would anybody want these?

131
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
 I mean, who wants these?

132
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,760
 Why, what do they have in common?

133
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,200
 Well, you see, all of these things

134
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,360
 are talking about one thing, which is about me.

135
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,760
 Not me, but about the self.

136
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,580
 Every one of these items is talking about for yourself.

137
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,760
 I mean, envy, I mean, why would you envy someone?

138
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,280
 Well, because whatever it is that they have,

139
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,940
 you also want, right?

140
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,080
 Strive, you wanna like cause rivalry, because why?

141
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,160
 You wanna say, I'm better than you.

142
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,760
 So I'm gonna prove that I'm right and you're wrong.

143
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,020
 And malicious talk, why do you wanna talk badly of others?

144
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,640
 Well, you wanna judge them, you wanna say you're better.

145
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,160
 So it's like self lifting, you're lifting yourself up.

146
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,120
 And by saying these evil suspicions,

147
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,880
 like you're saying they have these evil intentions.

148
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,880
 When all of us, all along, you're the one that has it,

149
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,720
 not you, but I mean, the people, the false teacher,

150
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,160
 all the ones that have it.

151
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,480
 And they constantly will fight and argue with other people,

152
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,300
 just for one thing, which is to lift themselves up,

153
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,080
 put others down, and everything, if we read it,

154
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,760
 is actually to a point where they're robbed of the truth

155
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:31,760
 and think that godliness is a means to financial gains.

156
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,440
 So sometimes these people have gone so far

157
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,040
 that they've lost what is most important.

158
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,920
 You see, the difference between sound teaching

159
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,840
 and false teaching is that it's all about you

160
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,000
 and your own benefits rather than other people.

161
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,200
 And they're using money in the wrong way.

162
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,080
 Now, one of the examples we probably have heard before

163
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,440
 is that there might be preachers and leaders

164
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,680
 who misuse money in a way that is so bad

165
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,580
 it's for their own interests.

166
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,440
 Now, one of them, I'm gonna use today an example,

167
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,680
 which is Kong He, he is the founder

168
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,520
 of City Harvest Church in Singapore.

169
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,600
 And he was convicted of fraud

170
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
 after spending millions of Thai

171
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,640
 to fund his wife's music career.

172
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,560
 And this is a classic example of where sometimes

173
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,560
 our heart can be so torn or so dragged into other desires

174
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,920
 that we actually lose the focus of what's important.

175
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,640
 And so that's why in verse six to 10, it says,

176
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,200
 "But godliness with contentment is great.

177
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,360
 For we brought nothing into the world

178
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,800
 and we can take nothing out of it.

179
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,520
 But if we have food and clothing, we'll be content."

180
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,700
 You know, there's something about contentment

181
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,600
 that gives us a great gain.

182
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,560
 Now, we're quite sure that Apostle Paul

183
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,400
 is probably not talking about monetary gain

184
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,960
 'cause he's just said that all these

185
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,320
 are not really that important.

186
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,480
 And so there must be a greater gain.

187
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,840
 And what is that?

188
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,880
 Contentment gives us a greater gain

189
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,280
 than what money could buy us.

190
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,120
 But what gain is that?

191
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
 Now, we read to the next verse, it says,

192
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,800
 "Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap

193
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,480
 and into many foolish and harmful desires

194
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,280
 that plunge people into ruins and destructions."

195
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,560
 So what we see is the flip side.

196
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,680
 If we don't have contentment,

197
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,680
 we're gonna fall into the temptations,

198
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,240
 we're gonna fall into these destructions.

199
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,400
 So what is this greater gain that we could have

200
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,400
 if we have contentment is that we will not fall

201
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,960
 into these temptations, we will not be destroyed.

202
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,480
 And so why?

203
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,500
 For the next verse, it says,

204
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,000
 "For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,360
 Some people eager for money have wandered from their faith

206
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,440
 and pierced themselves with many griefs."

207
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,760
 Which was the example that we've just used earlier.

208
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,520
 Because, okay, so money is not the root

209
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,200
 of all kinds of evil, that's not what the verse says.

210
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,320
 But the love of money is.

211
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,200
 Now, why is because if our heart is already filled

212
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,740
 with all these desires for more things,

213
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,240
 we won't have a space to do what's right.

214
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,280
 I mean, maybe you can say,

215
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,440
 "Well, I'm pretty sure all of us here, we don't love money.

216
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,920
 I mean, we don't hate it definitely,

217
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,240
 but I mean, who hates it?

218
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,600
 Let me know 'cause then, yeah, anyways."

219
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,320
 Anyways, but rather or not you love money or not,

220
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,160
 it actually is a part of our everyday life, right?

221
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,160
 The moment you wake up, the place that you live in,

222
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,040
 well, that costs money.

223
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,040
 The breakfast that you have, well, unless you're fasting,

224
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,140
 you're having breakfast.

225
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,720
 And then the clothes that you wear,

226
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,280
 and then the job that you have,

227
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,640
 whether it's this one or that one

228
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,840
 is gonna be a big difference depending on the pay, right?

229
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,040
 And depending on the spouse you choose,

230
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,040
 you're gonna have a different lifestyle altogether.

231
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,160
 So you see, the reason that it is the root,

232
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,160
 the reason that the love of money

233
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,000
 can be the root of all evil

234
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,480
 is because it's tapped into every single part of our lives.

235
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,840
 And so if we love it so much,

236
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,840
 then how can we choose between what God wants us to do

237
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,820
 and our own personal desires?

238
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,360
 How can we choose that?

239
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,160
 And so that's why we need to see

240
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,560
 that the love of money is the root of all evil.

241
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,920
 And so I still remember a time,

242
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,440
 I mean, this is a pastoral letter,

243
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,780
 which means that it's really meant for leaders.

244
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,880
 And you might be saying to yourself,

245
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,440
 well, I'm not a leader, so all this false teaching,

246
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,320
 I'm not leading church in that direction,

247
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
 what does that have to do with me?

248
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,600
 But the thing is, we need to guard ourselves

249
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,500
 against those teachings,

250
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,620
 as well as to know that we ourselves need to flee from it.

251
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,440
 And so I remember a time when I went to a meeting

252
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,200
 in another church, not this one, not Kung Fu, okay?

253
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,760
 And where the pastor misused a part of the passage

254
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,920
 of Mark 4:20, and he said, you know,

255
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,180
 today, he told us that day,

256
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,180
 God is asking you to put all your money in your purse

257
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,940
 into the offering bag, and he's gonna bless it

258
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,160
 by 30 folds, 60 folds, 100 folds.

259
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,920
 And in that moment, he also told us his testimony.

260
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,500
 He said, when I gave all of my salary to God,

261
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,500
 actually, the following week, my money came back,

262
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,060
 and it was doubled as much.

263
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,140
 Now, hearing what he said, both a little bit fearing,

264
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,000
 because he said, God told us, and also because,

265
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,240
 well, it's also nice to double my money, right?

266
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,220
 So I said, okay, I'll put in all the money

267
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,820
 that I had in my wallet.

268
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,220
 And I have to say, it's a little bit painful for me,

269
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,340
 because that day, I think I just came back from Canada,

270
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,060
 so I had about a few thousand dollars

271
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,020
 of Canadian dollars there.

272
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,720
 So I was like, all of it, okay, all of it.

273
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,740
 I'm glad I had my octopus card so I can go home.

274
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,200
 And so a few weeks later, you know,

275
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,340
 it's kind of like, oh, you know, God,

276
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,340
 no, nothing's coming back, and, you know,

277
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,980
 I don't know where the doubling went,

278
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,740
 and I still vividly remember, you know,

279
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,860
 an impression from God that kind of said,

280
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,020
 well, I never said your money would double.

281
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,100
 And what I wanted to say is, I mean,

282
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,020
 we need to be discerning.

283
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,100
 I'm not saying that everybody, you know,

284
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,420
 sometimes we have hosts who comes up and say,

285
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,500
 okay, it's time for offer.

286
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,440
 I'm not saying that that's not good,

287
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,420
 but if you feel like you're being pushed to give,

288
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,820
 or you feel like that the preacher or the teacher

289
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,340
 is telling you that this is a means

290
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,780
 to gain financial gains, then we gotta be careful.

291
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,940
 And so the second way, the first way is to flee

292
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,220
 from what is false, which is about ourselves,

293
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,660
 and also for the love of money.

294
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,060
 Now, the second thing that we should do

295
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,780
 is to pursue these virtues.

296
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,900
 Now, remember in verse 11, it says,

297
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,780
 we need to pursue righteousness, godliness,

298
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,620
 faith, love, endurance, and gentleness.

299
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,620
 And interestingly enough, when we find this list,

300
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,100
 it's actually the exact opposite of what we heard earlier.

301
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,260
 I mean, righteousness is actually compared

302
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,940
 to foolish and harmful desires.

303
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,940
 And godliness with contentment,

304
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,260
 remember we talked about contentment.

305
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,140
 Once we're content, we no longer need to go

306
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,900
 after these financial gains.

307
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,100
 And again, faith, and then we won't be robbed of the truth.

308
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,300
 We won't be wandering from our faith.

309
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,980
 We need to go after love, endurance, and gentleness.

310
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,100
 So he's asking us, hey, go after these things.

311
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,820
 Flee away from the bad and go after these things.

312
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,500
 But this is one of the harder questions.

313
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,980
 I mean, how can we pursue these things?

314
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,420
 'Cause it's easy to have a list.

315
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,260
 I mean, how do you go about doing that?

316
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,900
 Well, it really is about this contentment

317
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,340
 that we talk about.

318
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,500
 If we are content with what God has given us,

319
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,100
 then why would our hearts be dragged away to somewhere else?

320
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,140
 I mean, imagine, I mean, if you see a nice car zooming by,

321
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,380
 right, don't start to imagine, well, it would be nice

322
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:47,540
 if I'm in that car, start imagining like a pretty girl

323
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,300
 next to you, right?

324
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,700
 Like be content.

325
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,020
 Maybe you go on the bus, like wow,

326
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,980
 what a spacious bus I have, right?

327
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,900
 (audience laughing)

328
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,700
 Look at your wife, beautiful, all the time.

329
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,780
 And, or if you're like scrolling your Facebook, right,

330
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,260
 don't be like, oh wow, that's a big house.

331
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,460
 Look at my apartment.

332
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,780
 But be content.

333
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,140
 We can train ourselves to be content.

334
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:13,780
 Maybe we'll repaint the walls, put some nice light.

335
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,740
 Just be content.

336
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,060
 And when we are, our hearts will not be pulled

337
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,300
 here and there, and we can pursue these goodness.

338
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,940
 And we can do good.

339
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,740
 We can be, we can see the injustice in the world

340
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,220
 and we can go and we can like look after the widows

341
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,500
 and the orphans and we can have faith in God.

342
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,300
 And so this nicely leads us into a third point,

343
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,500
 which is to take hold of the eternal life.

344
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,420
 Now when we hear these, it seems that we know

345
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,980
 all these words, take hold, we know, okay.

346
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,460
 Eternal life, we know.

347
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,340
 Okay, how do we take hold of the eternal life?

348
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,340
 That we don't really know.

349
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,740
 But here it tells us, fight the good five of faith.

350
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:00,860
 Take hold of eternal life to which you were called

351
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,420
 when you were made your good confession

352
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:06,180
 in presence of many witnesses.

353
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,380
 Now the moment that we've received Christ into our lives,

354
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,060
 we have been called to a higher living.

355
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,860
 We're no longer living for materials anymore,

356
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,860
 not for the temporal, but we're living for the eternal,

357
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,460
 something greater.

358
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,140
 And in verse 13 and 14 it says,

359
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,460
 in sight of God who gives life to everything

360
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,880
 and of Jesus Christ, who while testifying

361
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,720
 before pointless Pilate, made the good confession,

362
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,140
 I charge you to keep this command,

363
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,640
 which is to make that good confession,

364
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,740
 without spot or blame until the appearing

365
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,020
 of our Lord Jesus Christ.

366
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,200
 And Paul's really saying this, and he continues by saying,

367
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,720
 which God would bring about in his own time,

368
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,400
 God the blessed and the only ruler,

369
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,320
 the King of kings and Lord of lords,

370
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,120
 who alone is immortal and who lives

371
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,120
 in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see.

372
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,200
 To him be honor and might forever, amen.

373
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,880
 I mean, why does he put all those together?

374
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,160
 He's saying that if we are to take hold

375
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,920
 of this eternal life, we have to think about who God is.

376
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,560
 I mean, a lot of times we think,

377
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,680
 oh, God is this loving father, you know,

378
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,920
 who take care of us wherever we are.

379
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,080
 But look at all these words that he's putting out.

380
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,880
 The blessed one, the only ruler,

381
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,160
 the King of kings and Lord of lords, we say that,

382
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,220
 but do we think about that?

383
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,380
 And who alone is immortal, unapproachable light.

384
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,860
 Wow.

385
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,560
 You know, just like the song we sang earlier,

386
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:50,540
 you know, like glory and holy and how great is he.

387
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:54,580
 That is what our eyes needs to be fixated on.

388
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,340
 And so, I mean, what does that life really look like?

389
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,300
 What is a life that's, you know, it's fleeing away,

390
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,700
 is running away from false teaching and love of money?

391
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
 What does a life look like?

392
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,100
 Who is pursuing all these goodness

393
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,020
 and taking hold of this eternal life?

394
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,660
 What's it like?

395
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,180
 Well, a few days ago, I saw a post online

396
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,900
 by my friend who shared about her mother.

397
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,700
 They're both from Korea, but now my friends in Hong Kong.

398
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,380
 And with her permission, I'm gonna share this with you.

399
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,460
 It reads like this.

400
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,300
 It's a Facebook post.

401
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,380
 "Winter is approaching.

402
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,060
 "Got my mother a white sweater.

403
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,340
 "She's someone who finds hard to buy anything for herself.

404
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,540
 "Her whole life was for others.

405
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,480
 "How can a person be so other-centered?

406
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,480
 "Her DNA and heart is twinned so differently and beautifully.

407
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,060
 "I've tried to educate her to spend some money on herself,

408
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,840
 "but realized her whole life pattern wasn't like that.

409
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,660
 "It's easier for me just to observe what she needs

410
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,160
 "and gets it for her.

411
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,660
 "That's it.

412
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,360
 "When she left, temporarily, she says,

413
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,920
 "Africa, after 28 years of pouring her heart,

414
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,040
 "all her belongings were able to be packed

415
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,860
 "in a small luggage.

416
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:27,820
 "Even inside that, half was filled with her medical stuff,

417
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,280
 "goodbye cards from orphanage,

418
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,360
 "and special needs children she had been loving so dear.

419
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,460
 "Her bank account had dollars,

420
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,280
 "just enough to buy a plane ticket.

421
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,840
 "Nothing was invested.

422
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,940
 "Three of us, my sister, brother, and I, had meetings.

423
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:49,040
 "How to support her continually.

424
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:54,040
 "I must say it was a burden, but a very thankful burden.

425
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,380
 "I cannot understand how one's life can be so simple

426
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,300
 "and not attached to this world at all.

427
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,460
 "Someone whose perspective, dreams, and treasures

428
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,820
 "are always on the things above.

429
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,600
 "She is special.

430
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,760
 "Her name is Sun Hee Lim.

431
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,620
 "The kids of the orphanage call her Sunny."

432
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:23,120
 And so a few days ago, she just arrived to Hong Kong.

433
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,200
 And now she's actually being quarantined,

434
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,520
 and I've sent her the link,

435
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,560
 so she's most likely online with us.

436
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,680
 So she just wanted to say hi, Sunny,

437
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,840
 and you can all wave to her at the back.

438
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,480
 Hi, Sunny, hi, Ara.

439
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,820
 I mean, what a beautiful life this is.

440
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,120
 This is an extraordinary woman.

441
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,120
 And she went to Namibia, Africa, for 28 years.

442
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,800
 Now, early in her life, she was trying to find fundings

443
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,760
 from over 50 churches in Korea.

444
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:59,200
 And each church would give her around $100 to $200,

445
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,200
 Hong Kong dollars, to support her.

446
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,360
 Now, most of the missionaries would find at least 150%

447
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,400
 of what they need before they would leave the country.

448
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,960
 But just with 70% of what she had, she already left.

449
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,040
 And before she left, she gave everything that she had away,

450
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,280
 especially the clothes that needed dry cleaning.

451
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,280
 Apparently, she knows that there's no dry cleaning in Africa.

452
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,760
 And when she was there, she focused on evangelizing,

453
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:35,480
 Bible study, and supporting her husband's missions work.

454
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,840
 In her later years, she focused on the special needs children.

455
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,620
 But in 2003, she was diagnosed with cancer.

456
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,360
 And in the same year, her husband passed away.

457
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,160
 But that did not stop her from doing her missionary work.

458
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,160
 Actually, over the next 10 years, she had over 10 surgeries.

459
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,200
 And each of those surgeries,

460
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,880
 she had to remove an organ after an organ,

461
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,020
 because the cancer has spread to different places.

462
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,600
 And yet each time, right after she finished her surgery,

463
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,560
 when she could just barely stand,

464
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,760
 she would go back to Africa.

465
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,080
 Because she remembered the children, like all these photos,

466
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,440
 she remembered her, she remembered them in her hands,

467
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,480
 and she said she had to go back.

468
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,520
 I mean, there were moments when she wanted to give up,

469
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,360
 because it was so painful.

470
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,240
 Imagine going through all those.

471
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,480
 And there was so much difficulties in front of her.

472
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,400
 Do you know what she did in those times?

473
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,220
 She said she would read the Bible

474
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,320
 from Genesis to Revelation,

475
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,340
 day and night until it was finished.

476
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,120
 And she said that kept her going.

477
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,120
 It comforted her and gave her the strength to press on.

478
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:09,400
 And so she didn't stop until 2009.

479
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,920
 She came back, she went back to Korea,

480
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,440
 in which COVID limited her to go back again for now.

481
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,880
 All the finances, all the funds,

482
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,180
 100%, she said, went to all the people.

483
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,300
 She did not have any investment of her own.

484
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,720
 No retirement plans, no NPF.

485
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,440
 And yet she always looked above,

486
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,560
 trusting daily all that she has in need.

487
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,220
 I'm very moved by her story,

488
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,160
 because I think, what are we doing?

489
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:48,120
 My question to you, to me also,

490
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,080
 what are we doing here?

491
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,280
 I mean, how many luggages of things

492
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,880
 do you and I have at home?

493
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,280
 I don't think I can pack all my shoes in one luggage.

494
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,480
 I mean, how much of our resources

495
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,960
 do we do for the good of others?

496
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,700
 And how much hardship are we willing to endure for the Lord?

497
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,360
 I mean, are we equal to the glory of the Lord

498
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,320
 that we just talked about?

499
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,200
 The Lord of Lords, the King of Kings.

500
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,920
 Are we thinking about ourselves most of the time?

501
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,560
 When we look at our internet search

502
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:33,400
 and see what we've been searching up the last few days,

503
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,200
 we can look at the bills that we pay

504
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,060
 and look at where it all went to.

505
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,420
 We'll have a better idea, a fact check.

506
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,240
 And maybe to some extent, I think,

507
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,720
 we're not very different from the false teachers.

508
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,280
 You know, sure, I mean, we don't go around

509
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,400
 using our Christian stand to try to sell you anything.

510
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,820
 But maybe in our hearts somewhere,

511
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:03,920
 we actually think that God is for our own benefit

512
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:08,600
 to prosper us, to bless us.

513
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,880
 And Paul does say, you know,

514
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,880
 he is there but for greater gain, an eternal one.

515
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,880
 Except, I don't know, how often do we see that?

516
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,560
 How often do we take hold of this eternal life?

517
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,140
 Or are we still living for the temporal?

518
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,840
 Now, I'm not saying that Paul's telling us,

519
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,840
 you know, don't enjoy anything.

520
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,480
 That's not what he's saying.

521
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,520
 We should enjoy the toils of our work.

522
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,780
 But what I am saying, and I believe that Paul is saying,

523
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,080
 is that, and later in the few verses which we won't get to,

524
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,420
 is to remind those, especially the wealthy ones,

525
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,360
 to do good, to do good, good deeds,

526
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,900
 to serve those, the orphans, the widows, the ones in need.

527
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,480
 And so what may that look like to us?

528
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,600
 Maybe we'll support a kid if we can't go there.

529
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,720
 And I don't think we should all

530
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,840
 fly out to Africa tomorrow.

531
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,740
 But maybe we'll support a kid in the third world country.

532
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,220
 Maybe we have widows around us.

533
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,820
 Maybe we'll visit them.

534
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,360
 Orphans, let's buy them some gifts

535
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,340
 and share the time together.

536
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,380
 Maybe we'll volunteer for an organization

537
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,620
 that we believe is worthwhile.

538
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,540
 Maybe instead of buying new clothes,

539
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,380
 next time we pick it up, like, do I really need this?

540
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,620
 What can I do with this money?

541
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,100
 What can I do with my time?

542
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,580
 The love of money is the root of all evil.

543
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,920
 May we be content.

544
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,500
 May we pursue all the goodness.

545
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,780
 I mean, look at these photos.

546
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,480
 I think it says and it tells us

547
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,620
 what it means to uphold that eternal life.

548
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,360
 So I charge you today, and also myself,

549
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
 fight the good fight of faith.

550
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,760
 Flee from those false teaching.

551
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,220
 And the love of money is not about us.

552
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:23,020
 And for us to pursue what is good,

553
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,240
 when our heart is wide, when we're content, we can.

554
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,240
 And so always look and take hold of that eternal life

555
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,460
 which we are called to, because God is good

556
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:40,460
 and he's worthy of every ounce of our offering.

557
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,100
 May he have all the glory.

558
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,320
 Let us pray together.

559
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,100
 Dear heavenly Father,

560
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,740
 you are the King of kings and Lord of lords.

561
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:56,780
 You are the immortal, the unapproachable light.

562
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,780
 Oh, Father, help us to fix our eyes on you

563
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,220
 and to know that you've given us a greater gain

564
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,460
 than the materialistic world that we see.

565
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,140
 Father, help us to live a life

566
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,720
 that is worthy of the calling that you have for us.

567
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:18,260
 Father, help us each day to live just the way

568
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,520
 that you want us to.

569
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,140
 May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

570
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,040
 May you have all the honor and glory.

571
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,800
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

572
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:40,800
