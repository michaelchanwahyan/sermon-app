1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 (audience applauding)

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:08,200
 Good.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,440
 While the cats away,

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,440
 the mice play.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:29,320
 We live in interesting times.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,520
 I think in the last few months

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,000
 and even the last few days,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,280
 we have all been through a plethora of emotions.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:51,320
 Now, I need you to read my lips

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,640
 and please do not quote me out of context here.

11
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,560
 Democracy is a good thing,

12
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:10,440
 but it is not a God thing.

13
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,640
 On the other hand,

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,600
 what is both a good thing and a God thing is theocracy.

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,600
 What is both a good thing and a God thing is theocracy.

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:39,600
 And this described Israel in the time of Joshua.

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:48,240
 At the end of the life of Joshua, reread this.

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,160
 "We will serve the Lord our God and obey Him."

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,040
 I'll repeat that.

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,680
 "We will serve the Lord our God and obey Him."

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:17,680
 But what happened in the next generation

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,680
 next generation is a different matter

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,720
 and is sadly summed up in the book of Judges.

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,520
 And these two verses from chapter two set the scene.

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:45,080
 Verse seven, "The people served the Lord

26
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,960
 throughout the lifetime of Joshua

27
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,200
 and of the elders who outlived him

28
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,120
 and who had seen all the great things

29
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,780
 that God had done for Israel.

30
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,360
 Then Joshua died."

31
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,700
 And in verse 10, we read this.

32
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,960
 "After that, the whole generation

33
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,880
 had been gathered to their ancestors

34
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,760
 another generation grew up

35
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,280
 who knew neither the Lord

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,340
 nor what he had done for Israel."

37
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,480
 And Pastor Johnny, that's why we've got to all be 100%

38
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,680
 behind what we're doing for Titus, SCP

39
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,280
 and the various programs.

40
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,160
 So instead of exhibiting spiritual further,

41
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,260
 Israel sank into apathy.

42
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,640
 Instead of obeying the Lord,

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,220
 the people moved into apostasy.

44
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,320
 Now I'm looking for words with S, apost word,

45
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,480
 it means abandonment, that's another A.

46
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:10,060
 Instead of enjoying Lord and order,

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,060
 the land was filled with anarchy,

48
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:23,200
 apathy, abandoning God, anarchy.

49
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:35,440
 My friends, look at CNN, look at BBC,

50
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,560
 look at SCMP.

51
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,000
 This could be 2020.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,800
 And so we're beginning a new 10 week sermon series

53
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,900
 through the book of Judges.

54
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,140
 We are not going to go through it verse by verse,

55
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,320
 but we will look at it from an overview perspective,

56
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,560
 starting today with Judges one and two.

57
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,320
 (pages rustling)

58
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,880
 The name of the book of Judges comes from the title

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,880
 given to 12 leaders known as Judges of Israel

60
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,260
 in the period between Joshua and Samuel.

61
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,940
 Now the book of Judges is made up of poetry,

62
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,940
 riddles, but mainly narrative history.

63
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:44,900
 Its author is anonymous, but it's normally assumed

64
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,700
 that Samuel the prophet wrote it between 1086 and 1004 BC.

65
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:58,620
 And over the next few weeks,

66
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,200
 we're gonna be looking at judges like Othniel,

67
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,200
 Ehud, Deborah, Gideon, Abimelech, Jephthah,

68
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,600
 Samson and Delilah.

69
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:17,780
 But what is the purpose of the book?

70
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:25,340
 The book's purpose was to teach Israel that God is faithful

71
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:33,020
 and he will punish people for their sin

72
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,940
 if they don't remain loyal and devoted to him.

73
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,740
 (pages rustling)

74
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:44,740
 Let me give you a short outline of the book.

75
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,780
 In the first three chapters up to Judges 3, 6,

76
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,220
 we find that the Israelites have failed to keep

77
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,500
 their part of the covenant with God.

78
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,020
 And they didn't entirely conquer and take control

79
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,220
 of the land that they were promised.

80
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,380
 And as we will see through this sermon series,

81
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,460
 the problem unfortunately goes wildly out of control

82
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,720
 as time goes on.

83
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,200
 In Judges 3, 7 up to chapter 16,

84
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,860
 the biggest chunk of the book,

85
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,200
 we see God raising up judges to rescue Israel several times.

86
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,780
 And what we will see that this is a vicious cycle

87
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,580
 that's appearing where the Israelites sin,

88
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,680
 then God rescues them.

89
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,040
 They worship God for a while

90
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,640
 and the sin starts all over again and so forth.

91
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,200
 We will see that these rescues were temporary

92
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,200
 because we find that the nation's obedience only lasted

93
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,500
 for the lifetime of that particular judge.

94
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,640
 In Judges 17 to 21,

95
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:16,340
 we see Israel sinking into a horrible state

96
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,160
 of demise and ruin.

97
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:26,540
 And it's during this time that we find the sad words

98
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,480
 of Judges 21, 25, the title for our series.

99
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,840
 In those days, Israel had no king.

100
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,920
 Everyone did as they saw fit.

101
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:47,000
 Everyone did as they saw fit.

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,820
 Do you sort of recognize that?

103
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,940
 We are living in times of political correctness

104
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:03,060
 where people are afraid to say anything against anyone

105
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,480
 just in case they get sued

106
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,860
 or just in case they think they are being too judgmental.

107
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:16,200
 And that's because people don't like being told

108
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,840
 that what they're doing is wrong.

109
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,960
 Yet God has spoken.

110
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,080
 His rules are clear.

111
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,880
 He didn't give the Israelites 10 suggestions.

112
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,920
 He gave them 10 commandments.

113
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,140
 And so it's important that they and even us

114
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:50,600
 know the blessings of obedience

115
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,480
 and the consequences of disobedience.

116
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,540
 And as we go through this really sad book,

117
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,300
 we're gonna see the consequences of a people

118
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,420
 who refuse to be obedient to God.

119
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,940
 This truly what we're gonna be looking at

120
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,540
 for the next 10 weeks is the most evil

121
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,540
 and darkest time in the history of Israel as a nation.

122
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,240
 Look at this, Judges 2, 16.

123
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,240
 "Then the Lord raised up judges

124
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,300
 who saved them out of the hands of these raiders.

125
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:42,260
 Yet they would not listen to their judges,

126
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,680
 but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them.

127
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:54,420
 They quickly turned from the ways of their ancestors

128
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,420
 who had been obedient to the Lord's commands."

129
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,140
 This was a time of disaster on a colossal scale

130
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,560
 for the nation of Israel.

131
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,860
 Now we all know, don't we, that God's people,

132
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,340
 the Israelites were led into Canaan to conquer the land.

133
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:22,220
 But instead they become infected

134
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,400
 with the idolatry of the Canaanites.

135
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:32,300
 "They were told to make no treaties with the inhabitants.

136
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,640
 They were not to marry any foreigners,

137
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,620
 but they were happy to settle amongst the Canaanites."

138
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,900
 To the point is, the point is,

139
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,380
 you don't know who the Israelites were

140
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,860
 and who the Canaanites were.

141
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:52,180
 Instead of driving out the Canaanites,

142
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,860
 they just became like them

143
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,900
 and practiced what they practiced.

144
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:05,020
 Right from the very first few verses in Judges,

145
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:11,460
 we can see Israel only partially obeying God.

146
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,160
 Judges 1 verse 6,

147
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,160
 "Adonai Bezek fled, but they chased him

148
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,740
 and they caught him.

149
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,900
 And then what did they do?

150
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,580
 They cut off his thumbs and big toes."

151
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,060
 Now, what were they supposed to do?

152
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,540
 They were supposed to kill off the Canaanites.

153
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,320
 And what did they do?

154
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,160
 They mutilated the captured king,

155
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,240
 which was the very practice of the Canaanites.

156
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,680
 There's more.

157
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,520
 Verse 28, "When Israel became strong,

158
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,300
 they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor,

159
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,360
 but never drove them out completely."

160
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,280
 What were they supposed to do?

161
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,560
 They were supposed to drive the Canaanites out of the land.

162
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,860
 But what did they do?

163
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,820
 They kept them and forced them to work for them.

164
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:19,500
 I say to you tonight, KFCI,

165
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:26,220
 do you see how easy it is

166
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,220
 to allow the world around us to influence us?

167
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:39,020
 The world is trying to conform us to its standards

168
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,180
 and its ways, but God doesn't want us to think

169
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,840
 the way the world thinks.

170
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:50,820
 God has called us to a higher standard

171
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,780
 and we have to answer to a higher authority.

172
00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:01,340
 Israel was happy to compromise with the world around them

173
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,440
 during this time.

174
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,260
 And that compromise,

175
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,180
 the compromise with the Canaanites

176
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,740
 led them into idolatry, into marriage,

177
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,880
 and eventually to having no rules.

178
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,620
 Judges 17, six, "In those days, Israel had no king.

179
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,580
 Everyone did as they saw fit."

180
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,980
 What a sad picture this is

181
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,160
 of God's chosen people.

182
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,160
 Now you might be forgiven for thinking,

183
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,120
 we don't fall down on worship idols today.

184
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,360
 But I need to tell you

185
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,280
 that the old gods are still with us today.

186
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,000
 They've simply updated their appearance

187
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,080
 and they've updated their accommodating times.

188
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,880
 They still claim to provide the meaning to life

189
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,480
 and they still promise to provide for our personal desires.

190
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,740
 They still demand wholehearted commitment

191
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,580
 from their worshippers.

192
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,120
 And what are those idols called?

193
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,300
 Materialism,

194
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,940
 comfort,

195
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,160
 power,

196
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,180
 and sensual immorality.

197
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,420
 Let me say it again.

198
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,400
 Materialism,

199
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,980
 comfort,

200
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,520
 power,

201
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,260
 and sensual immorality.

202
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:58,620
 And so the outcome of Israel's compromise

203
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,180
 was the shocking reality

204
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,180
 that the real enemy

205
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,460
 became God himself.

206
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,120
 I need to tell you that if you're picking which side

207
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,220
 to be in, don't have God on the other side.

208
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:19,320
 And he ensured that when they went out to battle,

209
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,960
 the outcome was defeat.

210
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:28,980
 But God, who is rich in mercy,

211
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,440
 in his grace, raised up leaders

212
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,420
 to bring Israel back into line.

213
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,840
 You see, the judges were deliverers.

214
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,760
 They were charged with restoring the peace.

215
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,400
 They were spiritual as well as political leaders.

216
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,460
 And there are 12 judges listed.

217
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:57,260
 Now we're given a lot of information about some of them.

218
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,320
 And whilst other judges are simply just mentioned,

219
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,560
 and I've put the series up here,

220
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,280
 we will be covering the major ones.

221
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:13,320
 And as we go through this sad, almost depressing book,

222
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:19,280
 we will see that everything rises and falls on leadership.

223
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,600
 I think I better say that again

224
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,200
 'cause it still applies today.

225
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,200
 Everything rises and falls on leadership.

226
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,420
 But we will also see that God uses weak, imperfect people,

227
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,480
 like you and me, to accomplish his work.

228
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,300
 And he uses the most unlikely leaders

229
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,360
 to demonstrate his grace and power.

230
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,720
 You see, for Israel during the period of judges,

231
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,300
 it was a time of war.

232
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,740
 Like I mentioned earlier,

233
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,520
 the Jewish nation were charged

234
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,540
 with driving out the Canaanites.

235
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,080
 But you've got to ask yourself,

236
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:15,720
 why would God send them to a land that was already occupied?

237
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,640
 Why couldn't he send them to a place where no one lived

238
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,520
 so they could settle there

239
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,720
 and they didn't have to have any influence around them?

240
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,640
 After all, they spent 40 years of hardship

241
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,320
 in the wilderness.

242
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,460
 And now they were gonna have to deal

243
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,820
 with internal and external conflict.

244
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,680
 Judges chapter three tells us this.

245
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,580
 James will be covering it next week, but please follow this.

246
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,480
 These are the nations the Lord left

247
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,160
 to test all those Israelites

248
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,580
 who had not experienced any of the wars in Canaan.

249
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,920
 He did this only to teach warfare

250
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
 to the descendants of the Israelites

251
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,040
 who had not had previous battle experience.

252
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,920
 The five rulers of the Philistines, the Canaanites,

253
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,120
 the Sidonians, the Hivites,

254
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,840
 living in the Lebanon mountains

255
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,000
 from Mount Balhamun to Lebohama.

256
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,740
 They were left to test the Israelites,

257
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,200
 to see whether they would obey the Lord's command,

258
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,920
 which he had given to their ancestors through Moses.

259
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:37,480
 God led them to Canaan to test them.

260
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,780
 He wanted to know if they would be obedient to him.

261
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,020
 He wanted his people to trust him,

262
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,960
 to trust in his mighty power,

263
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,920
 to trust that he would help them

264
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,820
 take hold of the promised land.

265
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,640
 He wanted them to remember that they were holy,

266
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,940
 chosen and his treasured possession.

267
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,680
 He wanted them to remember who they were as a people

268
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,000
 and that they needed to know how holy they were to be.

269
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,140
 They needed to remember why, why they were chosen

270
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:16,040
 and just how treasured they were to God.

271
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:22,080
 Now, remember, we are dealing with a new generation

272
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,000
 of Israelites from those who had wandered in the desert.

273
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,720
 Judges 2, verse 10,

274
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,760
 after that whole generation

275
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,320
 had been gathered to their ancestors,

276
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,320
 another generation grew up who knew neither the Lord

277
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,520
 nor what he had done for Israel.

278
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,700
 But this second generation was responsible

279
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,140
 for their own spiritual failings.

280
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,220
 The text says they didn't know God.

281
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,220
 It doesn't mean they weren't aware of God.

282
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,100
 It means they did not regard or acknowledge God

283
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,180
 as their Lord.

284
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,660
 Things haven't changed very much today, have they?

285
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,920
 Most people in the world are aware of the God of the Bible,

286
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,480
 but they refuse to have any regard for him

287
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,600
 or acknowledge him as their God.

288
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,840
 Now, when we go through this book,

289
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,960
 you will see that Israel are acting

290
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,960
 almost like children in classroom.

291
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,380
 Do you remember that?

292
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,240
 For some of us, it's a long time ago.

293
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,540
 (audience laughing)

294
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,380
 You know what happened

295
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,340
 when the teacher leaves the room, right?

296
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,480
 Teacher leaves the room for a while, at least in my day.

297
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,160
 You can almost guarantee that the kids

298
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,460
 will get up to all sorts of mischief.

299
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,360
 When the cat's away, the mice play.

300
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,840
 Pitches up again, as the saying goes.

301
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,120
 And that was what it was like for the judges.

302
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,360
 When they appeared, God appeared,

303
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,840
 and everyone went back to their best behaviour.

304
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,560
 But as soon as a judge dies,

305
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,400
 the children of Israel got involved

306
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,720
 in all kinds of sinful practices.

307
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,480
 You see, whenever people are left to themselves,

308
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,400
 you can almost guarantee it won't be long

309
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,640
 before we find ourselves in deep trouble.

310
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,760
 God had delivered them from the terrible slavery in Egypt,

311
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,840
 and He led them through the wilderness,

312
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,840
 giving them blessing after blessing.

313
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,960
 They were His favoured people.

314
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,220
 They were the chosen ones of the Lord God Almighty.

315
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:58,680
 And so He led them, He fed them, He protected them,

316
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,160
 and eventually He led them into the land of Canaan,

317
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,720
 which was their promised land.

318
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,440
 It was a land flowing with milk and honey,

319
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,840
 and it was given to them, not because they were so great,

320
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,620
 but because God had promised this land to their ancestors.

321
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:23,800
 What other ways were they blessed?

322
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,300
 They were blessed with God's protection.

323
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,540
 Judges 1:19 says,

324
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,980
 The man of Judah.

325
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,860
 This shows us that God was actively involved

326
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:40,500
 in helping Israel conquer the nation of Canaan.

327
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,180
 And so He not only prepared the way,

328
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,900
 He also protected them along the way.

329
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:55,780
 They also had the blessing of God's power.

330
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,740
 Judges 1 verse 4,

331
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:11,900
 This tells us who the real power on the battlefield was.

332
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,660
 It was God.

333
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,360
 He is the God of all power.

334
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,820
 And we too, as Christians,

335
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:24,480
 have the same power available today and at work in us.

336
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,120
 What other blessing did they have?

337
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,560
 Well, they had the blessing of God's promises.

338
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,460
 For hundreds of years,

339
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,740
 beginning with Abraham in Genesis chapter 12,

340
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,460
 God had been promising to give the nation of Israel

341
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,980
 a homeland, and so they were blessed

342
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:47,500
 beyond their wildest dreams.

343
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,580
 The blessing of God's protection,

344
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,140
 of God's power, and of God's promises.

345
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,140
 But as we've already seen,

346
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:06,500
 all those blessings were quickly gonna be removed

347
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,140
 by God Himself.

348
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:14,340
 This new generation of Israelites forgot their heritage

349
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,420
 and denied the very God who made them who they were.

350
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,660
 And so slowly, but surely,

351
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,100
 they went down the compromising route.

352
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,500
 God had warned them before they entered the land,

353
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,000
 back in Numbers 33,

354
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,560
 that they must destroy the people of Canaan.

355
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,440
 But they also had another warning.

356
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,860
 He said this,

357
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,540
 "But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land,

358
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,100
 those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes

359
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,060
 and thorns in your sights.

360
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,740
 They will give you trouble in the land where you live.

361
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,600
 And then I will do to you what I plan to do to them."

362
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,700
 So as we will see over the next few weeks,

363
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,700
 sadly, this was gonna become a harsh reality for Israel.

364
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:22,060
 Here the text tells us there were some Canaanites

365
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:26,260
 they didn't fear, and so they forced them to work for them.

366
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,980
 But again, they didn't drive them out of the land.

367
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,060
 Judges 1.32, the Asherites lived amongst

368
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,740
 the Canaanite inhabitants of the land

369
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,100
 because they did not drive them out.

370
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,260
 Neither did Nathali, drive out those

371
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,940
 who were living in Beth Shemesh or Beth-anath.

372
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,260
 But the Nathalites too lived amongst

373
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,220
 the Canaanite inhabitants of the land,

374
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,060
 and those living in Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath

375
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,200
 became forced laborers for them.

376
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,380
 My question,

377
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,500
 isn't there a danger

378
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,620
 of history repeating itself

379
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:11,640
 with God's children today?

380
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,660
 I mean,

381
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,420
 we spend a lot of time surrounded by sin,

382
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,620
 and sometimes we become desensitized to it.

383
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:33,340
 Now, I enjoy chilling out watching Netflix,

384
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,180
 particularly during COVID-19.

385
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,900
 I've gotta be honest with you guys,

386
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,740
 I didn't realize how desensitized

387
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,980
 I had become.

388
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:54,380
 The amount of swearing, the amount of using

389
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,900
 the Lord's name in vain in films,

390
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:02,580
 naked bodies on films that are rated for 13-year-olds.

391
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,740
 It's unbelievable.

392
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:12,100
 You see, instead of maintaining

393
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,100
 our spiritual purity as Christians,

394
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,460
 we begin to adopt the ways of the world.

395
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:26,260
 Church, there are times

396
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:32,260
 when we talk like them, we walk like them,

397
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,620
 we do what they do, we go where they go,

398
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,380
 we watch what they watch,

399
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,300
 we like what they like and behave like they behave.

400
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,580
 And if we're not careful,

401
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,980
 we will become like Israel during the time of the judges.

402
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:54,580
 We can very easily adopt the attitude

403
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:58,140
 that sin isn't all that bad anyway.

404
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,380
 We can very easily allow the walls of separation

405
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,500
 that existed between the church and the world

406
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,780
 to erode to a point where it's hard to tell

407
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,100
 the difference between the two any longer.

408
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:22,300
 In other words, do we really feel

409
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,500
 that we can play around with sin

410
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,180
 and avoid getting burnt?

411
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,180
 Do we really believe that God is gonna allow His people

412
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,420
 to sin without being punished?

413
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:44,740
 Because of their sin, Israel faced the Lord's judgment

414
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,380
 and as we will see, they were gonna have to endure

415
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,620
 a divine sentence from God.

416
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,500
 Now I know this has been a tough message today,

417
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:06,260
 but it's not all doom and gloom.

418
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:13,060
 Let's turn our Bibles to Judges 2.60.

419
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,420
 I'm gonna ring from the King James Version.

420
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:23,340
 Nevertheless, the Lord raised up judges

421
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,540
 which delivered them out of the hand

422
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:31,500
 to those that spoiled them.

423
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:37,100
 Isn't that amazing?

424
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:43,460
 In spite of their failures, God still sent them,

425
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,380
 men and women, to lead them and speak to them.

426
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,740
 And as we're gonna see over the next few weeks,

427
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,620
 sometimes God's people listened

428
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,940
 and sometimes they didn't.

429
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,940
 But, and this is important, church,

430
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,660
 despite all their sin, despite all their hard-heartedness,

431
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:09,660
 God still loves them and God is patient with them,

432
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:16,060
 giving them every chance to set things right.

433
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:22,540
 Oh, how we need to hear that kind of message, don't we?

434
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,260
 If only we can be as loving and patient with each other

435
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,100
 as we expect God to be with us.

436
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:41,460
 We say, "God, I've let you down so many times this week.

437
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,820
 "I'm so sorry."

438
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,060
 God says, "I know you have.

439
00:31:54,060 --> 00:32:00,460
 "Nevertheless, I still love you."

440
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:07,140
 We say, "God, I'm really struggling with sin in my life.

441
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:11,140
 "I'm so sorry, please forgive me."

442
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,700
 And God says, "I know you are.

443
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,420
 "Nevertheless, I'm being patient with you.

444
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,900
 "And if you repent, I will forgive you."

445
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,460
 Or maybe you're here tonight and you're not yet a Christian

446
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,900
 and you're thinking, "Hey, I've done too many bad things

447
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,400
 "in my life for God to have any interest in me."

448
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,900
 And God says to you tonight, "And if that's you here,

449
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,560
 "I know you have.

450
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:51,100
 "Nevertheless, I love you so much

451
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,480
 "and I sent my son to die for you."

452
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:01,540
 Although the book of Judges is a record

453
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,460
 of Israel's very dark history,

454
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,840
 which can be very challenging to read and apply today.

455
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,620
 And yes, there are blessings for being obedient to God.

456
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,340
 And yes, we can see there are consequences to be paid

457
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,140
 when we're disobedient to God.

458
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,140
 But as we take the next 10 weeks

459
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:32,940
 to read very carefully between the lines,

460
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:40,420
 I believe that each one of us will see the love

461
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,900
 and the grace of God like we've never seen before.

462
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:54,420
 And I don't know about you, I'm excited about that.

463
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,820
 Can I ask the band to come up?

464
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,380
 I know tonight hasn't been an easy word to receive.

465
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:18,200
 It's not been jolly John at the front tonight.

466
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,460
 This is a very important word for us

467
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,580
 because there is good news at the end of it.

468
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:34,500
 If you will throw yourself upon God and God's mercy,

469
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,940
 He says, "I know what you've done,

470
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,580
 but nevertheless, I love you.

471
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,740
 I bless you. I will guide you."

472
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:54,820
 The book of Judges is the story of our God's grace and mercy.

473
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:02,300
 I wanna use this time that we have left tonight

474
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:07,820
 for us to throw ourselves upon God's grace and mercy.

475
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,780
 Can you close your eyes, please?

476
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:19,900
 I realise this has not been an evangelistic sermon tonight,

477
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:25,980
 but I wanna give an opportunity for anyone here tonight

478
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,540
 who is currently not following Jesus Christ.

479
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:33,900
 We just wanna say we are so grateful

480
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,780
 that you're here with us this evening.

481
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,360
 (gentle music)

482
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,900
 This is not all bad news

483
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,900
 because if you will come before God tonight

484
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:51,340
 and admit that you've done things wrong,

485
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:55,380
 admit that you need His forgiveness,

486
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,540
 and that you'll come to the cross of Jesus.

487
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,460
 There is forgiveness.

488
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,300
 There's the grace that we sang about.

489
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,660
 And I wanna give an opportunity now for anyone who's here

490
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:13,220
 to receive Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour.

491
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:15,940
 This is not about the person sitting next to you.

492
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,980
 It's not about your family or your friends.

493
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,620
 This is about you.

494
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:27,660
 You say, "Pastor John,

495
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,580
 you've painted a pretty tough picture of God tonight."

496
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,980
 Remember, this was the same God

497
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:39,740
 who sent His Son to die for you

498
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,420
 and die for me upon the cross.

499
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,740
 And if you will accept that tonight,

500
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,740
 you can receive His grace and mercy.

501
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,340
 Just while every eye is closed, and please respect this,

502
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,700
 if you'd like to avail yourself

503
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,940
 of this free gift of salvation tonight,

504
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,980
 to receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour,

505
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,340
 I'd love to pray for you.

506
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:14,180
 If you'd like to be included in that prayer,

507
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,020
 I'm gonna ask you to do one very, very simple thing,

508
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,020
 just while every eye is closed.

509
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,580
 If you could put your hand up,

510
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,140
 and I know who I'm praying for.

511
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,900
 If you would like tonight to give your life to Jesus Christ,

512
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,020
 I'm gonna give you a few moments.

513
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,860
 Just put your hand up, and I would love to pray for you.

514
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,940
 Thank you, thank you for, thank you.

515
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,820
 See hands across the place.

516
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,740
 We have a number of hands that are going up.

517
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,420
 Now, I never know why somebody has responded

518
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,660
 in an article like this,

519
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,420
 but what I wanna say is God sees this.

520
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,580
 One, two, three, are there any more

521
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,700
 that you wanna give your life to Jesus Christ?

522
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,340
 Just put your hand up.

523
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,820
 Thank you, I see that hand as well.

524
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,260
 We'll just wait for a moment.

525
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:09,260
 Let's all pray together,

526
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,380
 shall we, just for the benefit

527
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,220
 of those that are raising their hands.

528
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,820
 Repeat after me, Father God,

529
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,300
 I come to you tonight,

530
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,860
 and surrender my life.

531
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:23,780
 I realize I've done things wrong,

532
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,940
 but I know you as a God of mercy and grace.

533
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,380
 You sent your Son, Jesus Christ,

534
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,780
 to die for my sins.

535
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,420
 Jesus, I believe you're the Son of God.

536
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,220
 I believe you died for my sins.

537
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,260
 Come into my life.

538
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,780
 Forgive me.

539
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,580
 Fill me with your Holy Spirit.

540
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:51,980
 And help me to live a life that pleases you.

541
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:56,020
 In Jesus' name, amen.

542
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,580
 In Jesus' name, amen.

543
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,780
 Shall we welcome those people who've prayed that prayer.

544
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:07,940
 And if you prayed that prayer,

545
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,660
 please see somebody afterwards,

546
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,300
 whoever friends, or come to the well afterwards

547
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,180
 and someone will pray for you.

548
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,140
 Now our response song tonight

549
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,140
 is a song of reflection.

550
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,580
 It's not a jolly jolly,

551
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,220
 oh praise the name of the Lord our God.

552
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,140
 We're gonna sing that song

553
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,300
 we've been singing for a couple of weeks,

554
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,660
 that lovely song,

555
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,860
 Lord, you're sovereign over us.

556
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:35,460
 And I want you to at least start off

557
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,820
 by staying in your seats

558
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,780
 and allowing this.

559
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,900
 If you want to kneel, kneel.

560
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,500
 If you want to sit, sit.

561
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,540
 But this is time for you to do business with God.

562
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:53,540
 There's one thing we've all got in common in this room.

563
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,580
 We're all sinners.

564
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,620
 Actually the Bible calls us wretched sinners.

565
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,540
 But the thing we've all got in common

566
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,700
 is the blood of Jesus Christ which saves us.

567
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,500
 We are saved by grace.

568
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,340
 You cannot be saved by your good works.

569
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,300
 You cannot be saved by what you do.

570
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,300
 You can only be saved by faith in Jesus Christ.

571
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,820
 So I just invite you to use this time.

572
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,500
 It's your time with God.

573
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,700
 Don't worry about what the person next to you is doing.

574
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,060
 Either listen to these words,

575
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,780
 allow Paul to sing them over you.

576
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:36,660
 But whether you've been a Christian for two minutes

577
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,180
 or whether you've been a Christian for 50 years,

578
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,660
 I beg you tonight,

579
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:46,940
 just throw yourself upon God.

580
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,220
 Throw yourself upon His mercy and grace

581
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,660
 because He is there ready to receive us.

582
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,620
 He is more ready to give than we are to ask.

583
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:02,500
 Let's finish this service by doing business

584
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:10,620
 with a God of mercy, a God of grace,

585
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,020
 a God of forgiveness,

586
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:17,580
 and a God who will give you and I life.

587
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,860
 Let's worship together.

588
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,440
 (gentle music)
