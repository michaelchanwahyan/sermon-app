00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Hi KFC, so awesome to be with you today. And today we're going to be talking

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,960
 about the King's resurrection. John last week did a great job of explaining to us

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,840
 the King's ransom. He went through Palm Sunday in which Jesus was celebrated as

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,920
 he went in and entered into Jerusalem. He talked about the Lord's Supper and

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,120
 shortly after that the King was betrayed by his own disciple. The King was then

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,920
 denied by his friend when he was in trial. The King was rejected by his

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:44,440
 people. Barnabas was chosen over this King. The King was stripped,

8
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:53,040
 beaten and mocked. And then on Good Friday the King was crucified. The King

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:03,240
 was crucified on the cross. And so the mood is very sad. The disciples

10
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,280
 dispersed like a sheep, like a shepherd, like sheep without a shepherd. They hid.

11
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:19,040
 But on that morning, Easter Sunday, the women came out. And we read in Matthew

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,080
 chapter 28, "After the Sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,840
 and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. There was a violent earthquake for

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,560
 an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back

15
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,640
 the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,120
 white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like

17
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,000
 dead men. The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid for I know that you are

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:04,200
 looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here. He has risen just as he said.

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,240
 Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples he has

20
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,480
 risen from the dead and going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,960
 now I have told you." We're going to talk about three things here today. The first

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:29,000
 thing that we notice is that the angel says, "He is risen. Jesus is king over

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,480
 death. Jesus is king over death." In these times, we've seen so much death. The latest

24
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:45,000
 tolls tallies are there is over 130,000 deaths because of this coronavirus.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,520
 People are fearing death. People are afraid to die. But Jesus conquers over

26
00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:00,640
 death. Jesus is the only person that has died and rose again.

27
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,800
 Muhammad the Prophet died and did not rise. Buddha died. Confucius died. But

28
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,720
 Jesus is the only one that died and rose again. He is the ultimate sacrifice for

29
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,920
 us. In the olden days, you know, in the Old Testament, they had to bring a lamb to

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,680
 sacrifice to represent their sin. But Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice. We no

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,480
 longer have to bring a sacrifice because Jesus died once and for all. And now we

32
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:42,040
 no longer have to fear death as well because Jesus has conquered death on the

33
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:50,520
 cross. The second thing we notice is that he is risen, that the King is king over

34
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:59,520
 life. Jesus is king over life. The virus makes us reflect upon life, what life

35
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:10,160
 really is about. Life is short. Life is so fragile. Life on earth is finite. We

36
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,280
 treasure the important things. We start to treasure the important things during

37
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:21,800
 these times. The family that we have, the friends that we've met, we start to

38
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,120
 question what is the purpose of our life, the goals that we have, and the

39
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:36,640
 accomplishments that we've made. The first thing that Jesus really proposes

40
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,920
 to us is that he came so that we could have life and have it to the fullest,

41
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,880
 have it abundantly. He says that in John chapter 10 verse 10. So many people are

42
00:04:49,880 --> 00:05:00,080
 alive but yet do not truly live. Jesus is king of life. Jesus says, "What good is it

43
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,920
 for a man to gain the whole world, all the riches, yet forfeit his soul?

44
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:12,040
 Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?" Jesus is

45
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:19,880
 king over life, life to the fullest. And in John it also says that now this is

46
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,360
 eternal life, that we may know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have

47
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:34,680
 sent. Jesus is not only king over this life, but eternal life, the eternal life.

48
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:43,320
 If we know Jesus Christ, we have eternal life. And the last thing it says, the

49
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:52,320
 angel said, "He is risen just as he said, just as he said." Jesus is the king of

50
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:04,600
 truth. His words are truth. Jesus claimed that in three days he would rise, tear

51
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,360
 down the temple, and in three days I will raise it again, that he would go away for

52
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,760
 a little while and then he will appear again. He is the truth. His words are

53
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:24,000
 truth. They tried to even suppress this truth, right? They, Rome tried to put Roman

54
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,720
 guards to have a Roman seal of this tomb so that nobody could get this body, so

55
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,200
 that Jesus' words would not be true. But yet the angel came and opened the tomb

56
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:46,600
 and Jesus rose from the dead. The Jews also tried to suppress the truth. They

57
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:54,400
 paid the soldiers to say the disciples came and stole the body. But we know that

58
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,240
 the testimony of the disciples is that Jesus rose, he appeared and rose from the

59
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:11,160
 dead. Jesus also fulfills more than 300 prophecies in the Old Testament. His

60
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,760
 birth, his life, his miracles, the suffering that he had, the death, and his

61
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:23,760
 resurrection was all prophesied in the Old Testament, and it has become true. He

62
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:32,640
 is the promise, the promise fulfilled as it was written in the Old Testament. So

63
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,640
 Jesus is king over death. He is our ultimate sacrifice. Jesus is the king of

64
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:49,320
 life. He is our Messiah. Jesus is king of truth. He is the promise, the promise

65
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,480
 fulfilled. We're gonna continue to read verse 8 to 10. So the women hurried away

66
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:01,480
 from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly

67
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:07,760
 Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, collapsed at their feet, and

68
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:16,400
 worshipped him. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go

69
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:26,080
 to Galilee. There they will see me." Jesus met these women, and what happened? They

70
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:35,920
 collapsed at his feet and worshipped him. Muhammad was never worshipped, right?

71
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,080
 Muhammad was never worshipped. He just said, you know, "I am a prophet."

72
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,360
 Confucius was never worshipped. He never claimed that he was God, but Jesus

73
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:53,360
 claimed that he is the I Am. He is the Messiah. He is the Alpha and the Omega,

74
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,680
 the second person of the Trinity. He was there in creation. All things were made

75
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:06,040
 in and through him. Jesus accepted this worship. He didn't say, "Oh no, don't

76
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,480
 worship me." No, he accepted this worship as they collapsed at their feet and

77
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:21,160
 worshipped him. He is the Lord. He is our God. This is the King of the universe.

78
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:30,240
 Jesus is King of our universe. And lastly, we see that Jesus is a personal King.

79
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,040
 Usually kings are in their castles. They're protected by their secret

80
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:45,840
 security, but no, this King is a personal King. In the passage earlier, we saw that

81
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,320
 the angel instructed the woman to go tell the disciples that he's gonna come

82
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,160
 to them. Jesus himself says, "Tell my brothers in Galilee. There they will see

83
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:04,400
 me." Jesus was in the tomb for three days, and the first thing he wanted to do when

84
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,680
 he came out of the tomb was to see his people, to see his disciples. He could

85
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,400
 have gone for a nice steak or another Passover dinner. No, no, he didn't do that.

86
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:25,600
 He wanted to go to see his people, and we know that Jesus appeared to more than

87
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,760
 500 people, his disciples and over 500 people, and that is one of the reasons we

88
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,440
 know that Jesus did rise from the dead because of the testimony of these

89
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,160
 disciples, and later their changed lives, that they were willing to die for this

90
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,240
 truth, even to death on the cross. Some of them martyrs as well, right? Peter

91
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:59,400
 upside down on the cross. So Jesus is our personal King. He is a King that

92
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,480
 understands the things that we've gone through. In Hebrews, it says that we have

93
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,400
 a high priest who is able to empathize with our weaknesses. He understands the

94
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:18,440
 things that we've gone through, yet he has overcome those things. Jesus is also a

95
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,960
 personal King that wants to know each one of you. He says in Revelation chapter

96
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:34,720
 3 verse 20, "Here I stand. I stand at the door and knock. If anyone opens, hears my

97
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,160
 voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person and they with

98
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,200
 me." Jesus wants to be in your life. Are you willing to open the door of your

99
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:56,280
 heart to let Jesus in to your life, to be your Lord and Savior? So today we talked

100
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:02,680
 about five things. That Jesus is King over death. He is our ultimate sacrifice.

101
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:09,280
 He is the bridge that allows us to be restored with the Lord. He is the wrath

102
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:15,120
 of God was taken upon him. He is the King of life. He allows us to live life to the

103
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:23,400
 fullest and abundantly. He is eternal life. If we know Jesus Christ, we have

104
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:33,280
 eternal life. He is our Messiah. Jesus is King of truth. Every word he says is true.

105
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,840
 He is our promise, the promises that were fulfilled in the Old Testament. He is the

106
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,800
 King of the universe, the women worshipped at his feet. He is our God.

107
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,040
 And lastly, he's a personal King. He's a King that understands the things that

108
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:59,160
 we've gone through. He is our High Priest and he wants to be the King over your

109
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:11,120
 life. Is Jesus King in your life? Is Jesus King in your life? I think as I've grown

110
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,480
 up throughout the teenage years, I've started to logically understand more and

111
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,960
 more that all the religions of the world teach that you can do something, right? In

112
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,000
 Islam, you have to pray five times a day. You have to go to the pilgrimage,

113
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,440
 you know, in order for Allah to accept you. In Hinduism, you got to, you know,

114
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,040
 worship all these gods and fulfill all their things so that they will save you.

115
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,720
 But only in Christianity is it that we cannot save ourselves, that we need a

116
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:54,880
 Savior. We need Jesus Christ. And I logically began to understand that more

117
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,240
 and more. And when I understood that logically, Jesus became the King over my

118
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,280
 life. Recently, my friend, you know, just became more and more serious about

119
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,680
 Jesus. And as he was having dinner with his father, his father was like, "This is

120
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,680
 the golden age of your life. You're in your 30s. Now is the time to make money

121
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,640
 and prosper." And he's like, "I now have a new perspective of life." This new

122
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:27,920
 perspective is that life is more than just this world. There is eternal life.

123
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,480
 Jesus has become King over his life. And now I'm going to invite Paul, and he's

124
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,680
 going to share a little bit about how Jesus has become King over his own life.

125
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,320
 So Jesus being King over my personal life has really been something that's

126
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,600
 been happening over time as he's been weeding out different aspects. But one

127
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:57,440
 clear moment to me in my life was really when I was 18, and God was

128
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,600
 really talking to me about taking my faith more seriously. And part of that

129
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,440
 was actually just giving up getting drunk and going out drinking. And at

130
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,640
 that time, it was really difficult for me. It didn't even make sense.

131
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:17,600
 It was something I could hide my insecurities behind, such as, you know, fear of not

132
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,480
 being able to relate to people. And even as a Christian, then I just found it hard

133
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,920
 to reconcile that and make sense of it. But it was what I needed to do, and so I

134
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:35,000
 had to do it. And then from reflecting, at that time I was allowing

135
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,120
 drinking to actually guide my actions and my thoughts more than what I

136
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,920
 was allowing God to, and allowing Jesus to. And so I was actually giving that

137
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,320
 drinking more authority than I was giving Jesus. So that authority needed to

138
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,640
 go back, whether or not it made sense to me at that time. And so I'm not sure if

139
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,360
 that's the most significant, but it was definitely the most significant to me in

140
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,600
 feeling, as it was quite difficult. And since then, really, it's just

141
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,680
 been a process of God showing different areas to me where I need to hand that

142
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,900
 authority back to Him, whether that's how I spend my time, the words that come

143
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,280
 out of my mouth, and just different areas like that where I've

144
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,900
 wanted to have my own rule, and just on each of those areas God's pressed me

145
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:32,040
 just to allow Him to be king in that. Thanks so much, Paul. And I'm hoping

146
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,740
 today that if you have not allowed Jesus to be in your life, to be king over your

147
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:44,480
 life, that you can make a decision today. And I would love to pray with you, and

148
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,600
 you can make this decision as we pray to God. Prayer is our communication with God.

149
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,320
 God is not as concerned with the words of your mouth as He is with the attitude

150
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,560
 of your heart. And so if you would like to invite Jesus to be king over your

151
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:07,720
 life, we can pray now. Pray with me. Dear Father, we thank you for Jesus Christ and

152
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,920
 what He did on the cross, His death and His resurrection. And in three days He

153
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:22,440
 proved that He is king over death, He's king over life, He is king of truth, the

154
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:31,280
 king of this universe, our God, and He is a personal king. And now, Lord, I want to

155
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:39,080
 invite you into my life to be my Lord and Savior. Would you come into my life

156
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:47,000
 and make me the person you want me to be. Forgive me of my sins. In Christ's name I

157
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,680
 pray. Amen.

158
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:57,320
 Bless you, KFC. And I pray that, Lord, you would take this message of our Lord's

159
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:03,720
 resurrection to your friends and your family as well. God bless you.
