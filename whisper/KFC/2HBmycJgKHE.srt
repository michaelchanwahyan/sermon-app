00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,420
 Good evening and welcome to KFC Online.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,080
 So pleased to have your company this evening.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,960
 We can't wait to get back together to see each other face to face.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,800
 But in the meantime, please feel free to join in the service as we worship together as we

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,600
 sing this song about Jesus Christ, our cornerstone.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:53,000
 [Music]

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:06,600
 My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:24,200
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.

9
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:38,200
 My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.

10
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:53,000
 I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Christ our Lord, cornerstone, weak but strong.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 In the Savior's love, through the storm, He is the Lord of all.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 While darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace.

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 In every high and stormy vale, my anchor holds within the veil.

15
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Christ our Lord, cornerstone, weak but strong.

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 In the Savior's love, through the storm, He is the Lord of all.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 He is the Lord of all.

18
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:54,600
 When He shall come with trumpet sound, oh, may I then in Him be found.

19
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:09,800
 Dressed in His righteousness alone, faultless stand before the throne.

20
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:20,200
 Christ our Lord, cornerstone, weak but strong.

21
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:38,200
 In the Savior's love, through the storm, He is the Lord of all.

22
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:48,200
 Christ our Lord, cornerstone, weak but strong.

23
00:04:48,200 --> 00:05:04,200
 In the Savior's love, through the storm, He is the Lord of all.

24
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:18,200
 He is the Lord of all.

25
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:42,200
 [Piano interlude]

26
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:56,200
 There was a moment when the lights went out, when death had claimed its victory.

27
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:11,200
 The King of love had given up His life, the darkest day of history.

28
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:26,200
 There on a cross they made for sinners, for every curse His blood atoned.

29
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:39,200
 One final breath and it was finished, but not the end we could have known.

30
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:50,200
 For the earth began to shake and the veil was torn.

31
00:06:50,200 --> 00:07:05,200
 But sacrifice was made as the heavens roared.

32
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:20,200
 All hail King Jesus, all hail the Lord of heaven and earth.

33
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:41,200
 All hail King Jesus, all hail the Savior of the world.

34
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:55,200
 There was a moment when the sky lit up, a flash of light that came through.

35
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:02,200
 When all was lost, He crossed eternity.

36
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:13,200
 The King of life was on the move, for in a dark cold tomb,

37
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 where our Lord was laid, a miraculous birth, a forever change.

38
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:47,200
 All hail King Jesus, all hail the Lord of heaven and earth.

39
00:08:47,200 --> 00:09:01,200
 All hail King Jesus, all hail the Savior of the world.

40
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:14,200
 All hail King Jesus, all hail the Lord of heaven and earth.

41
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:37,200
 All hail King Jesus, all hail the Savior of the world.

42
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:46,200
 Let every knee, let every knee come bow before the King of kings.

43
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,200
 Let every tongue confess that He is Lord.

44
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,200
 Lift up your shout, let us join with all of heaven singing.

45
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:12,200
 Holy, singing holy.

46
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:20,200
 Cloud holy, singing holy.

47
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:31,200
 All hail.

48
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:46,200
 All hail King Jesus, all hail the Lord of heaven and earth.

49
00:10:46,200 --> 00:11:15,200
 All hail King Jesus, all hail the Savior of the world.

50
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
 Thank you, worship team.

51
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,200
 I just wanted to say a few words about the next few weeks.

52
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,200
 Obviously at the moment, we're so keen to get back face to face,

53
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,200
 but at the moment government restrictions don't allow that to happen.

54
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,200
 Just to say that we're going to be back together as soon as we possibly can.

55
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,200
 But I just want to share with you a couple of things that we're doing.

56
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,200
 We're planning on the 2nd of May for all the churches,

57
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,200
 the international churches of Hong Kong, to gather together for an online service.

58
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
 We're going to be part of that.

59
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
 I want you to put that date in your diary now, 2nd of May,

60
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,200
 as we join with all of our colleagues in the different churches across this city

61
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,200
 to worship our God together.

62
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,200
 Then we'll be starting a sermon series in Esther.

63
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,200
 Because I want to tell you that you were born for such a time as this.

64
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:23,200
 The Esther story is one of the most realistic biblical accounts of God's providence,

65
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,200
 precisely because God seems absent.

66
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,200
 It shows how the unseen God often works through human history,

67
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:44,200
 not by miraculous intervention, but through completely ordinary events.

68
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,200
 In the book of Esther, a string of coincidences occur

69
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,200
 in order for the Jewish nation to be saved.

70
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:58,200
 A drunken and boastful king, a self-respecting queen, a beauty pageant,

71
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:04,200
 a sensuous girl, an overheard plot, and a timely insomnia.

72
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,200
 God even uses morally questionable decisions

73
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,200
 to work all things together for the good of his people.

74
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,200
 And through these inscrutable and seemingly insignificant means,

75
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,200
 he advances his purpose in the Esther story.

76
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:32,200
 God cares less about appearances and more about his sovereignty.

77
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,200
 Today, as we go through the coronavirus,

78
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,200
 if we can't see God at work in political decisions in Washington,

79
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,200
 or in medical ethics or healthcare, or in events in our daily life,

80
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,200
 we must not conclude he is not working.

81
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
 Esther teaches that in the providence of his people,

82
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,200
 he's working out salvation for his people.

83
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,200
 The Esther story is a reversal of the expected.

84
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
 What appears inevitable is not.

85
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
 Who appears powerful is not.

86
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,200
 Appearances are not what they seem.

87
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,200
 The author teaches us to make fun of the very forces that once threatened

88
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
 and will again threaten our existence,

89
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:24,200
 and thereby makes us recognise their triviality as well as their power.

90
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,200
 Today isn't the end of the story either.

91
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,200
 The powers that seem in control are not in control.

92
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,200
 The trajectory that seems inevitable is not inevitable.

93
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,200
 You were born for such a time as this.

94
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
 Welcome to the Esther story.

95
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,200
 We have this exciting opportunity happening in May.

96
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,200
 We're going to try and do Alpha online.

97
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,200
 So if you have friends or family that are interested in exploring life questions

98
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:04,200
 and basics about Christianity, you can invite them to join.

99
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:11,200
 And now I'm going to ask Bonnie and James to come and to pray for us.

100
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
 Lord, just thank you so much for giving us this time, Lord.

101
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 Thank you so much for technology, Lord, that allows us to, yeah,

102
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,200
 to be really able to still come together to worship your word,

103
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
 to listen to your worship online,

104
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,200
 and to just hear Pastor Johnny preach the sermon on Jesus' resurrection.

105
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
 Lord, today I just want to pray for Hong Kong.

106
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,200
 I pray that in the midst of the economy, Lord,

107
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
 I just pray that you would continue to provide.

108
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,200
 I just pray that you would continue to give people hope, Lord,

109
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
 especially when we're in such a time of darkness, Lord.

110
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,200
 And I pray that where people are unable to find their life and hope, Lord,

111
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,200
 I just pray that you would reach out and touch them, that you would also, yeah, Lord,

112
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
 just allow us to comply with government regulations,

113
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,200
 but also find ways to care and love for our brothers and sisters in need.

114
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,200
 Lord, I just pray that you would send us out while we are able to still respect our authorities, Lord.

115
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:18,200
 Send us out to also share resources with people, to just care for them and to just love them.

116
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:24,200
 And yeah, Lord, I just pray that while you would also help those who are financially struggling, Lord,

117
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:31,200
 I also pray that you would, yeah, Lord, allow us to be your hands and feet.

118
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,200
 And Father, Lord, we also lift up this whole world in prayer.

119
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,200
 We truly believe that you have the whole world in your hands.

120
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:46,200
 And as the virus continues to spread around the world, we pray that your good news will also spread.

121
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,200
 And we pray that your kingdom will continue to move and work in the hearts of many.

122
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,200
 We pray for the church as a whole, your body, that you will guide,

123
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:03,200
 your spirit will guide us in how to respond and how to love and how to serve the communities that you've placed us in.

124
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,200
 We pray for the leaders in the world who have tough decisions to make every single day.

125
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:16,200
 We pray that you will grant them wisdom and love as they navigate these uncharted waters.

126
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:21,200
 So we thank you again for you, God, because you are faithful and you are good.

127
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,200
 We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.

128
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,200
 Amen.

129
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,200
 So I'll pray again.

130
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
 I'll just introduce him.

131
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
 Introduce him.

132
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
 Okay.

133
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,200
 And now I'll pass the time over to Pastor Johnny, who's going to be delivering us the Word today.

134
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:47,200
 Hi KFC.

135
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
 So awesome to be with you today.

136
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
 And today we're going to be talking about the King's resurrection.

137
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,200
 John last week did a great job of explaining to us the King's ransom.

138
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:07,200
 He went through Palm Sunday in which Jesus was celebrated as he went in and entered into Jerusalem.

139
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,200
 He talked about the Lord's Supper.

140
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,200
 And shortly after that, the King was betrayed by his own disciple.

141
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,200
 The King was then denied by his friend when he was in trial.

142
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
 The King was rejected by his people.

143
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,200
 Barnabas was chosen over this King.

144
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,200
 The King was stripped, beaten, and mocked.

145
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,200
 And then on Good Friday, the King was crucified.

146
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,200
 The King was crucified on the cross.

147
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,200
 And so the mood is very sad.

148
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,200
 The disciples dispersed like a sheep, like a shepherd, like sheep without a shepherd.

149
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,200
 They hid.

150
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,200
 And on that morning, Easter Sunday, the women came out.

151
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,200
 And we read in Matthew chapter 28.

152
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:14,200
 After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.

153
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:20,200
 There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven

154
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,200
 and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it.

155
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,200
 His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow.

156
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,200
 The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

157
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:42,200
 The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.

158
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,200
 He is not here. He has risen.

159
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,200
 Just as he said, 'Come and see the place where he lay.'

160
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:59,200
 Then go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and going ahead of you into Galilee.

161
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,200
 There you will see him. Now I have told you.'"

162
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
 We're going to talk about three things here today.

163
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,200
 The first thing that we notice is that the angel says, "He is risen.

164
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,200
 Jesus is king over death. Jesus is king over death."

165
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,200
 In these times, we've seen so much death.

166
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,200
 The latest tolls, tallies are there is over 130,000 deaths because of this coronavirus.

167
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:37,200
 People are fearing death. People are afraid to die.

168
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,200
 But Jesus conquers over death.

169
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:46,200
 Jesus is the only person that has died and rose again.

170
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,200
 Mohammed the prophet died and did not rise.

171
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,200
 Buddha died. Confucius died.

172
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,200
 But Jesus is the only one that died and rose again.

173
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,200
 He is the ultimate sacrifice for us.

174
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:09,200
 In the olden days, in the Old Testament, they had to bring a lamb to sacrifice to represent their sin.

175
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
 But Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice.

176
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,200
 We no longer have to bring a sacrifice because Jesus died once and for all.

177
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:29,200
 And now we no longer have to fear death as well because Jesus has conquered death on the cross.

178
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,200
 The second thing we notice is that he is risen, that the king is king over life.

179
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,200
 Jesus is king over life.

180
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:46,200
 The virus makes us reflect upon life, what life really is about.

181
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,200
 Life is short. Life is so fragile.

182
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
 Life on earth is finite.

183
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,200
 We treasure the important things. We start to treasure the important things during these times.

184
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,200
 The family that we have, the friends that we've met.

185
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:15,200
 We start to question what is the purpose of our life, the goals that we have and the accomplishments that we've made.

186
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:28,200
 The first thing that Jesus really proposes to us is that he came so that we could have life and have it to the fullest.

187
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,200
 Have it abundantly. He says that in John chapter 10, verse 10.

188
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,200
 So many people are alive but yet do not truly live.

189
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,200
 Jesus is king of life.

190
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:52,200
 Jesus says, "What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, all the riches, yet forfeit his soul?

191
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,200
 Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"

192
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
 Jesus is king over life, life to the fullest.

193
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:12,200
 And in John it also says that now this is eternal life, that we may know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.

194
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:20,200
 Jesus is not only king over this life but eternal life, the eternal life.

195
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:26,200
 If we know Jesus Christ, we have eternal life.

196
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:32,200
 And the last thing it says, the angel said, "He is risen just as he said."

197
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,200
 Just as he said.

198
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:42,200
 Jesus is the king of truth. His words are truth.

199
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:49,200
 Jesus claimed that in three days he would rise.

200
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:58,200
 Tear down the temple and in three days I will raise it again. That he would go away for a little while and then he will appear again.

201
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,200
 He is the truth. His words are truth.

202
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
 They tried to even suppress this truth.

203
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:14,200
 They, Rome, tried to put Roman guards to have a Roman seal of this tomb so that nobody could get this body.

204
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,200
 So that Jesus' words would not be true.

205
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:27,200
 But yet the angel came and opened the tomb and Jesus rose from the dead.

206
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,200
 The Jews also tried to suppress the truth.

207
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,200
 They paid the soldiers to say the disciples came and stole the body.

208
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:48,200
 But we know that the testimony of the disciples is that Jesus rose, he appeared and rose from the dead.

209
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,200
 Jesus also fulfills more than 300 prophecies in the Old Testament.

210
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:05,200
 His birth, his life, his miracles, the suffering that he had, the death and his resurrection was all prophesied in the Old Testament.

211
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:16,200
 And it has become true. He is the promise. The promise fulfilled as it was written in the Old Testament.

212
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,200
 So Jesus is king over death. He is our ultimate sacrifice.

213
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,200
 Jesus is the king of life. He is our Messiah.

214
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:35,200
 Jesus is king of truth. He is the promise. The promise fulfilled.

215
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
 We're going to continue to read verse 8 to 10.

216
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:45,200
 So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.

217
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,200
 Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings!" he said.

218
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,200
 They came to him, collapsed at their feet, and worshipped him.

219
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:05,200
 Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me."

220
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:16,200
 Jesus met these women. And what happened? They collapsed at his feet and worshipped him.

221
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:23,200
 Muhammad was never worshipped. Right? Muhammad was never worshipped.

222
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,200
 He never said, "I am a prophet." Confucius was never worshipped.

223
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,200
 He never claimed that he was God. But Jesus claimed that he is the I Am.

224
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,200
 He is the Messiah. He is the Alpha and the Omega. The second person of the Trinity.

225
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,200
 He was there in creation. All things were made in and through him.

226
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:52,200
 Jesus accepted this worship. He didn't say, "Oh no, don't worship me."

227
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,200
 He accepted this worship as they collapsed at their feet and worshipped him.

228
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:06,200
 He is the Lord. He is our God. This is the King of the Universe.

229
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,200
 Jesus is King of our Universe.

230
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,200
 And lastly, we see that Jesus is a personal King.

231
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,200
 Usually kings are in their castles. They're protected by their secret security.

232
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,200
 But no, this king is a personal king.

233
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:36,200
 In the passage earlier, we saw that the angel instructed the woman to go tell the disciples that he's going to come to them.

234
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,200
 Jesus himself says, "Tell my brothers in Galilee. There they will see me."

235
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,200
 Jesus was in the tomb for three days.

236
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:54,200
 And the first thing he wanted to do when he came out of the tomb was to see his people.

237
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,200
 To see his disciples.

238
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,200
 He could have gone for a nice steak or another Passover dinner.

239
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,200
 No, no, he didn't do that. He wanted to go to see his people.

240
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,200
 And we know that Jesus appeared to more than 500 people.

241
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,200
 His disciples and over 500 people.

242
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,200
 And that is one of the reasons we know that Jesus did rise from the dead.

243
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,200
 Because of the testimony of these disciples.

244
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
 And later, their changed lives.

245
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,200
 That they were willing to die for this truth.

246
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
 Even to death on the cross.

247
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
 Some of them martyrs as well.

248
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,200
 Peter upside down on the cross.

249
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,200
 So Jesus is our personal king.

250
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,200
 He is a king that understands the things that we've gone through.

251
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:55,200
 In Hebrews, it says that we have a high priest who is able to empathize with our weaknesses.

252
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
 He understands the things that we've gone through.

253
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,200
 Yet he has overcome those things.

254
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,200
 Jesus is also a personal king that wants to know each one of you.

255
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:15,200
 He says in Revelation chapter 3 verse 20, "Here I stand. I stand at the door and knock.

256
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:25,200
 If anyone opens, hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person and they with me."

257
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,200
 Jesus wants to be in your life.

258
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,200
 Are you willing to open the door of your heart to let Jesus in to your life?

259
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,200
 To be your Lord and Savior?

260
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,200
 So today we talked about five things.

261
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,200
 That Jesus is king over death.

262
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
 He is our ultimate sacrifice.

263
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,200
 He is the bridge that allows us to be restored with the Lord.

264
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,200
 He is the wrath of God was taken upon him.

265
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
 He is the king of life.

266
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,200
 He allows us to live life to the fullest and abundantly.

267
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,200
 He is eternal life.

268
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,200
 If we know Jesus Christ, we have eternal life.

269
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
 He is our Messiah.

270
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,200
 Jesus is king of truth.

271
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,200
 Every word he says is true.

272
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,200
 He is our promise.

273
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,200
 The promises that were fulfilled in the Old Testament.

274
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
 He is the king of the universe.

275
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,200
 The women worshipped at his feet.

276
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,200
 He is our God.

277
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,200
 And lastly, he is a personal king.

278
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,200
 He is a king that understands the things that we've gone through.

279
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
 He is our high priest.

280
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,200
 And he wants to be the king over your life.

281
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,200
 Is Jesus king in your life?

282
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,200
 Is Jesus king in your life?

283
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,200
 I think as I've grown up throughout the teenage years,

284
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:08,200
 I've started to logically understand more and more that all the religions of the world teach that you can do something.

285
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,200
 In Islam, you have to pray five times a day.

286
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:18,200
 You have to go to the pilgrimage in order for Allah to accept you.

287
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:26,200
 In Hinduism, you have to worship all these gods and fulfill all their things so that they will save you.

288
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,200
 But only in Christianity is it that we cannot save ourselves.

289
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
 That we need a savior.

290
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
 We need Jesus Christ.

291
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,200
 And I logically began to understand that more and more.

292
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,200
 And when I understood that logically, Jesus became the king over my life.

293
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,200
 Recently, my friend just became more and more serious about Jesus.

294
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:57,200
 And as he was having dinner with his father, his father was like, "This is the golden age of your life.

295
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,200
 You're in your 30s. Now is the time to make money and prosper."

296
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,200
 And he's like, "I now have a new perspective of life."

297
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,200
 This new perspective is that life is more than just this world.

298
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
 There is eternal life.

299
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,200
 Jesus has become king over his life.

300
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
 And now I'm going to invite Paul.

301
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,200
 And he's going to share a little bit about how Jesus has become king over his own life.

302
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,200
 So, Jesus being king over my personal life has really been something that's been happening over time

303
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,200
 as He's been weeding out different aspects.

304
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,200
 But one clear moment to me in my life was really when I was 18.

305
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,200
 God was really talking to me about taking my faith more seriously.

306
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,200
 And part of that was actually just giving up getting drunk and going out drinking.

307
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,200
 At that time, it was really difficult for me.

308
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
 It didn't even make sense.

309
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:04,200
 It was something I could hide my insecurities behind, such as fear of not being able to relate to people.

310
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,200
 And even as a Christian, I just found it hard to reconcile that and make sense of it.

311
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,200
 But it was what I needed to do, and so I had to do it.

312
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:24,200
 And then, I'm reflecting, at that time I was allowing drinking to actually guide my actions and my thoughts

313
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,200
 more than what I was allowing God to and allowing Jesus to.

314
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,200
 And so, I was actually drinking more authority than I was giving Jesus.

315
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:40,200
 So, that authority needed to go back, whether or not it made sense to me at that time.

316
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,200
 And so, I'm not sure if that's the most significant, but it was definitely the most significant to me in feeling

317
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,200
 as it was quite difficult.

318
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:57,200
 Since then, really, it's just been a process of God showing different areas to me where I need to hand that authority back to Him,

319
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:04,200
 whether that's how I spend my time, the words that come out of my mouth, and just different areas like that

320
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:13,200
 where I've wanted to have my own rule, and just on each of those areas, God's pressed me just to allow Him to be king in that.

321
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
 Thanks so much, Paul.

322
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:23,200
 And I'm hoping today that if you have not allowed Jesus to be in your life, to be king over your life,

323
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,200
 that you could make a decision today.

324
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,200
 And I would love to pray with you.

325
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,200
 And you can make this decision as we pray to God.

326
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
 Prayer is our communication with God.

327
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,200
 God is not as concerned with the words of your mouth as He is with the attitude of your heart.

328
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,200
 And so, if you would like to invite Jesus to be king over your life, we can pray now.

329
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
 Pray with me.

330
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,200
 Dear Father, we thank you for Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross.

331
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,200
 His death and His resurrection.

332
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,200
 And in three days, He proved that He is king over death.

333
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,200
 He is king over life.

334
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
 He is king of truth.

335
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,200
 The king of this universe, our God.

336
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
 And He is a personal king.

337
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:22,200
 And now, Lord, I want to invite you into my life to be my Lord and Savior.

338
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,200
 Would you come into my life and make me the person you want me to be?

339
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,200
 Forgive me of my sins.

340
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,200
 In Christ's name I pray. Amen.

341
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,200
 Bless you, KFC.

342
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:45,200
 And I pray that, Lord, you would take this message of our Lord's resurrection to your friends and your family as well.

343
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
 God bless you.

345
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,200
 [Music]

346
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,200
 The moon and stars, they wept.

347
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,200
 The morning sun was dead.

348
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:34,200
 The Savior of the world was fallen.

349
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,200
 His body on the cross.

350
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,200
 His blood poured out for us.

351
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,200
 The weight of every curse upon Him.

352
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,200
 [Music]

353
00:36:52,200 --> 00:37:06,200
 One final breath He gave.

354
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,200
 As heaven looked to Him.

355
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:17,200
 The Son of God was laid in darkness.

356
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,200
 A battle in the ground.

357
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,200
 The war on death was raised.

358
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:31,200
 The power of hell's scepter broken.

359
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,200
 The ground began to shake.

360
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,200
 The stone was rolled away.

361
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:45,200
 His perfect love could not be overcome.

362
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,200
 Now death, where is your sting?

363
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:57,200
 Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated.

364
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,200
 Forever He is glorified.

365
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:10,200
 Forever He is lifted high.

366
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,200
 Forever He is risen.

367
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,200
 He is alive.

368
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,200
 He is alive.

369
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,200
 The ground.

370
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,200
 The ground began to shake.

371
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:32,200
 The stone was rolled away.

372
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:38,200
 His perfect love could not be overcome.

373
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,200
 Now death, where is your sting?

374
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:50,200
 Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated.

375
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:57,200
 Forever He is glorified.

376
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:04,200
 Forever He is lifted high.

377
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,200
 Forever He is risen.

378
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,200
 He is alive.

379
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,200
 He is alive.

380
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:27,200
 Forever He is lifted high.

381
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,200
 Lifted high.

382
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:47,200
 We sing.

383
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,200
 We sing hallelujah.

384
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,200
 We sing hallelujah.

385
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,200
 We sing hallelujah.

386
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,200
 The Lamb is overcome.

387
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,200
 We sing hallelujah.

388
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:08,200
 We sing hallelujah.

389
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,200
 We sing hallelujah.

390
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:15,200
 The Lamb is overcome.

391
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,200
 We sing hallelujah.

392
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,200
 We sing hallelujah.

393

 We sing hallelujah.

394
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,200
 The Lamb is overcome.

 We sing hallelujah.

396
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,200
 We sing hallelujah.

 We sing hallelujah.

398

 The Lamb is overcome.

399
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:53,200
 You've overcome.

400
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,200
 Now forever He is glorified.

401
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:07,200
 Forever He is lifted high.

402
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,200

 He is alive.

411
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,200
 Down the road of bliss you will stand.

412
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:05,200
 Your eyes are on Ted Kemp.

413
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,200
 He's overcome.

 He's overcome.

418
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,200
 Thank you Pastor Johnny for that message.

 We'd love to get in contact with you

423
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,200

424

 Also there's a worksheet attached to this sermon.

425
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,200
 Please take time afterwards to reflect,

426
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,200
 to go through this worksheet and complete it.

427
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,200
 Have a great week and we look forward to seeing you next week

428
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,200
 as we look at the Great Commission.

429
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
 Let's just pray together.

430
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,200
 Father God, we thank you for this service tonight.

431
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,200
 We thank you Lord for what you have done

432
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,200
 in the lives of the people watching it.

433
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,200
 And we pray your blessing on each one of us.

434
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,200
 Lord, guard us and guide us and keep us safe

435
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,200
 until we meet again.

436
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
 In Jesus name. Amen.
