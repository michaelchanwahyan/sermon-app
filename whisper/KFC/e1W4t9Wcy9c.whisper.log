[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.840]   (soft music)
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.260]   (soft music)
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:18.420]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:38.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:49.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:10.680]   - Oh, even watching that bumper just totally fires me up.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.900]   How are you today?
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.900]   KFC, what an absolute privilege and honor
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.660]   to be standing here on a stage in Kansas City
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.660]   in the United States and 12,500 plus kilometers away you are
[00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.020]   and we are together as one.
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.540]   I just think that is phenomenal.
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.480]   My name is Dan Diebel and seriously,
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.380]   I'm just pumped to be with you today
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.380]   and to be united around this one singular passion
[00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.760]   that you have and that we have.
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.860]   Basketball.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.580]   Yeah, I've done a little research on you
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.500]   and I know that's one of your passions.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.020]   We're going crazy right now.
[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.180]   This is a series of time for us called March Madness
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.700]   where everyone is just watching basketball all day long
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.960]   and I've got this friend, his name is Ryan Hoover.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.860]   We've been friends for over a decade now
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.100]   and Ryan was a standout basketball player
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.340]   at one of our premier universities here called Notre Dame
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.300]   and then he went on and played for 13 years
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.300]   in mostly in Italy and as he and I have been kind of,
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.980]   you know, talking throughout the years,
[00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.220]   he told me this story once.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.940]   He said this, he said, "What was really odd
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.860]   "and sometimes challenging playing in Italy,
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.380]   "one is nobody quite knew how to pronounce his name."
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.820]   They didn't quite have a frame of reference for Ryan.
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.340]   The only frame of reference they had
[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.220]   was the movie "Saving Private Ryan"
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.100]   which was translated in Italian as "Il Soldato."
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.840]   So that's what they called him.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.340]   They called him Il Soldato for his kind of sweet J
[00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.940]   and his fiery tenacious spirit
[00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.620]   and that's what we've started to call them too, Il Soldato.
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.980]   But here's what he said.
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.060]   He said, "Playing in Italy, particularly in this one league
[00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.060]   "in this one town, the media after every single game
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.280]   "would score him on their own scorecard.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.260]   "They would give him a grade on various kind of things
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.500]   "and then they'd publish it in the paper the next day."
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.300]   And here, I want you to just see,
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.980]   here's an actual scorecard for the team
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.060]   that he was playing on and if you can see at the very bottom
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.220]   is my friend Il Soldato, Ryan Hoover.
[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.820]   If you look at the top, top right-hand corner,
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.820]   the guy there, Buzzi Thornton, he got a score of 41.
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.060]   That's pretty high.
[00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.060]   And my friend Ryan Hoover, Il Soldato, got only a four.
[00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.880]   Now what the media didn't know
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.440]   was that he had a defensive assignment that night.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.320]   He was supposed to shut down their top scorer
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.760]   but they didn't know that.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.440]   They're just scoring against their scorecard,
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.520]   giving him a four when actually in the locker room,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.260]   the coach is probably giving him
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.880]   something higher than Buzzi.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.420]   Do you see the challenge of what's going on here?
[00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.160]   Number one, as Ryan told me, he goes,
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.720]   "Look, like the media really had never played
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.960]   "much basketball, at least professionally."
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.300]   So that's a problem, right?
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.380]   To give a scorecard as if you're the judge and jury
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.800]   when you'd never actually played.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.240]   But secondly, the media wasn't in the locker room
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.000]   to know what the assignments were,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.880]   to know what the game plan was,
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.860]   to know what the scorecard of the coach was.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.440]   So just imagine the tension
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.000]   that that would create among the team.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.940]   Am I going to play for myself
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.560]   to get the media scorecard grade,
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.680]   which is gonna be published
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.200]   to receive the public kind of affection and approval?
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.040]   Or am I gonna seek to please my coach and his scorecard?
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.040]   And am I gonna be a team player
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.540]   and go after what is really winning?
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.360]   Does that sound familiar to you?
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.560]   Do you feel actually as a human being,
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.000]   and perhaps as, or most particularly as a Jesus follower,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.440]   the tension of asking this question,
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.320]   what scorecard am I really using in my life?
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.080]   'Cause the fact of the matter is,
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.760]   you and I, at birth, we are handed a scorecard in life.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.520]   And we're rated by the world,
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.400]   we're rated on where you live,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.900]   what kind of job you have,
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.760]   the kind of possessions you own,
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.340]   the size of the diamond on your finger,
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.920]   the things that you have the freedom to do.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.760]   Basically, no matter what continent you're on,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.980]   every culture has kind of different status symbols,
[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.880]   different kind of rating systems,
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.120]   but it always seems to come down to possessions,
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.640]   to maybe your investments portfolio,
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.320]   it might come down to your resources, your connections,
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.480]   and we are scored every single day.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.000]   And if we're honest about it,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   it can drive us crazy inside.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.720]   The constant comparing, the wondering if I'm failing,
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.280]   the wondering if I'm measuring up,
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.520]   am I getting far enough in life?
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.440]   I mean, it can just wreak havoc in your mind
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.440]   if we rate ourselves according to the scorecard of the world
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.740]   and here's what I love.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.680]   What I love about being a Jesus follower,
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.920]   and every time I open the scriptures
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.200]   and every time I listen to the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.240]   you know what I hear?
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.080]   I hear our Father in Heaven saying,
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.960]   I keep a different score.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   I keep a different score.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.960]   So we're in this series called the One Campaign,
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.080]   sharing in it together, and what we're really doing
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.100]   is we're looking at the life of Jesus
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.520]   through the Gospel of Mark,
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.900]   and we're looking at all these different moments
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.120]   and encounters where he just flips everything upside down.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.800]   He basically says to his disciples over and over,
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.280]   give me your scorecard, come here, give it to me, all right.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.200]   And he just rips it to shreds and says,
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.560]   now, let me give you the new game plan.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.040]   Let me give you your new assignment.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.400]   Let me give you your new scorecard.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.040]   So here's what I wanna do.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.240]   I want us to kind of go through the section of Mark
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.280]   that we're all in together,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.400]   and I want us just to look at how Jesus
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.520]   begins to give a new scorecard to his disciples.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.880]   And it takes a little time for them
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.500]   to kind of like figure it out,
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.840]   but we're gonna look at seven different moments,
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.220]   and we're gonna actually compare and contrast
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.600]   via whiteboard here the scorecard of the world
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.840]   with the scorecard of Jesus.
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.760]   And it starts in Mark chapter nine,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.400]   so go ahead, grab your Bibles if you have 'em.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.800]   Otherwise, we'll have 'em here right on the screen for you.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.800]   But right, in Mark chapter nine, here's what's going on.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.960]   The disciples are having an argument, all right?
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.720]   And they're jockeying for power.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.600]   This is probably a succession moment.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.000]   Jesus just described that he's not gonna be around forever,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.880]   and then it's all of a sudden, hmm,
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.400]   well, who will be in charge then?
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.280]   And so here we come in verse 33, chapter nine.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.320]   They came to Capernaum.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.580]   When he was in the house, he asked them,
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:22.480]   what were you arguing about on the road?
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.600]   But they kept quiet.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.360]   I love this, because on the way,
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.920]   they had argued about who was the greatest.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.360]   Sitting down, which is a sign of,
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.440]   this is the coach coming out onto the court,
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:36.160]   bringing his stool, and everyone huddles up,
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.440]   huddle up, all right?
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.000]   Sitting down, Jesus called the 12 and said this.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.840]   Anyone who wants to be first must be the very last
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.400]   and the servant of all.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.380]   We're building the scorecard, right?
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.480]   The scorecard, the scorecard of the world, right?
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.600]   And by the way, we love the world.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.840]   God loves the world, but it's just we contrast
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.880]   the systems, the ethos, the values of the world
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.520]   compared to the scorecard of Jesus.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.440]   What do we say?
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.080]   Well, we see that according to the ways of the world,
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.480]   winning comes by being first.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.200]   And Jesus goes, uh-uh, uh-uh.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:20.800]   Winning comes through being last.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.960]   Now, I don't know about you in Hong Kong,
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.400]   but I can tell you for us in America, this is really hard.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:32.160]   This grates against our individualistic, right,
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.080]   just go for it spirit.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.040]   What's Jesus saying here?
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.480]   He's going, this is the path of self-absorption.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.000]   Now I'm calling you to not be about yourselves,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.800]   but to give yourself away.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.040]   That's what he's saying.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.800]   Scorecard item number one, winning comes,
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.360]   Jesus says, through being last.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.640]   Let's look at another moment.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.160]   Let's just move to verse 38.
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.840]   Now, John and the other disciples,
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.960]   they see something going down and they don't like it.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.880]   They go to Jesus, teacher, we saw someone
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.720]   driving out demons in your name.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.440]   And we told them to stop because, and get this,
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.280]   he was not one of us.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.880]   Oh man, there are places in our life and in our world
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.480]   to have really strong convictions,
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.600]   to say, here's just because of,
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.200]   I'm trying to be grounded in the scriptures,
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.280]   and I go, I can't join you in this,
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.560]   but there's also this danger of us versus them, right?
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.000]   And that's what's going on.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.520]   And so what does Jesus do?
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.600]   He says, don't stop 'em, right?
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.200]   And then he goes on, verse 40,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   for whoever is not against us is for us.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.640]   I can just guarantee, this is not what the disciples,
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.120]   they've just been handed this whole scorecard,
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.320]   all their life, right?
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.960]   Which says, you win by competition.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.600]   And I might add division, right?
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.440]   Dividing us versus them.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.240]   And Jesus is like, no, actually,
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.780]   if they're not against you, they're for you.
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.780]   You win by commonality, commonality, right?
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.160]   Let's meet people where they are.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.240]   And where they're doing good stuff,
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.400]   let's not constantly just divide and sequester,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.240]   let's join 'em.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.280]   Where the king was breaking in, let's join 'em.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.560]   It's beautiful.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.520]   Jesus is just already ripping
[00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.760]   their old scorecard to shreds.
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.600]   Why?
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.280]   Because he says, I keep a different score than you,
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.920]   and the ways of the world.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.160]   Let's jump to a third movement.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.440]   This gets really dicey, because at that time,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.800]   even still like today, there's all these cultural issues,
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.280]   and this one is about divorce.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.200]   And there was a big kind of debate
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.040]   between two different rabbinical lines of thought.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.160]   One is that it was pretty hard to divorce your wife,
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.880]   and the other is, it's really easy to divorce your wife.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.720]   Why?
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:06.280]   Because if you go back, Moses gave us
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.720]   this certificate of dismissal,
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.520]   and so we should be able to divorce our wives
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.740]   for about anything.
[00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.600]   So they bring this question to Jesus.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.800]   And I love what he does.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.640]   He does this, I mean, he just does this
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.440]   like beautiful coach move.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.760]   He doesn't really answer their question.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.120]   He goes beyond their question
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.160]   to the origin of design and creation.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.880]   Look with me, verse six, chapter 10.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.320]   But at the beginning of creation,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.520]   God made them male and female,
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.520]   and he goes on to just ground marriage
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.760]   in God's deep heart.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.640]   And so there's this cultural scorecard, right,
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   that says, well, marriage can end in dismissal.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.840]   And Jesus flips it all around and says,
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.560]   marriage begins in dignity.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.680]   And I'm just gonna share, I'm having cognitive dissonance
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.280]   whether I've, oh, dismiss, dismissal,
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.520]   that dismal, dismiss, ah, I know what I did wrong.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.600]   Dismiss, oh, and I still don't know
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.760]   if I'm spelling that right.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.960]   Having major issues right now in my brain.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.760]   Oh, but for the grace of God, go I.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.360]   Do you see what Jesus is doing here, though?
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:34.000]   He is absolutely ripping up the scorecard,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.740]   saying, I keep a different score, let's keep going.
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:41.980]   People were bringing little children to Jesus
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.760]   for him to place his hands on, right?
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.980]   But the disciples rebuked them.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.680]   They're like, man, kids, until they can be
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.040]   like working on the farm or working in the kitchen,
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.560]   until they can be productive,
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.000]   they really have no sense of value to us,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.240]   so don't hassle the rabbi with the kids.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.200]   And Jesus rebukes them, and he says,
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.400]   let the little children come to me,
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.560]   and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.760]   belongs to such as these.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:15.900]   What is Jesus saying?
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:18.040]   He says, I keep a different score.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.520]   How does status and access come?
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.520]   Well, the world would say it comes through hierarchy, right?
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.840]   What does Jesus say?
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.900]   Status and access to all these important things
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.900]   comes through humility, humility.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.600]   Let's keep going, let's keep going.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.660]   The next one, this rich, this guy who's got tons of doubt,
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.920]   he comes up to Jesus, but you can tell
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.220]   he's got rattle in his soul.
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.280]   He's got all these things,
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.540]   but something feels really unsettled for him,
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.540]   and he's hoping to assuage that vacuous thing
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.140]   that he's feeling in his spirit.
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.380]   So he comes to Jesus very respectfully,
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.180]   falls to his knees, and says,
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:07.380]   what must I do to inherit eternal life?
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.180]   And they have this interesting conversation
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:11.860]   about, well, have you fulfilled the 10 commandments?
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.660]   He said, yes, since birth, since I was a little kid,
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:15.780]   I've done all these things,
[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:19.780]   and that's when Jesus looks at him, and I love this,
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.420]   and loved him, one thing you lack, he said.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:30.860]   Go sell everything you have and give to the poor.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.260]   He goes on to say, and you will have treasure in heaven.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.780]   Jesus is gonna look, I keep a different score.
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.300]   You could have all the riches in the world
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.740]   and be impoverished, or you can empty yourself
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:46.380]   on behalf of the poor and be rich.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:47.860]   And what is he saying in this moment?
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.020]   The goal, according to the world, is prosperity.
[00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:58.180]   But the goal, according to the kingdom of God
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.520]   and the heart of the Father, is generosity.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.500]   Let's keep moving.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.340]   This is just so good.
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.060]   I mean, the contrast is just so thick.
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.740]   The sixth movement.
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.180]   Now, there's another argument by the disciples.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:17.500]   Surprise, surprise.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.060]   We all have, we can be really,
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.200]   what we say here in America, dense sometimes.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.260]   It takes us a while to really reorient ourselves.
[00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.140]   So there's another argument, right?
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:29.880]   There's two brothers, James and John.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:32.940]   They wanna sit at the right hand and the left hand of Jesus.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.460]   When he enters into their kingdom, they pull him aside.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.100]   They have this private conversation
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.380]   in a different gospel.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.420]   They actually invoke their mom to do their bidding.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.380]   It's really a mess.
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.420]   And the other 10 hear about it.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.340]   And they get really upset, indignant, the scriptures say.
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.540]   And that's when Jesus calls another timeout,
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:53.700]   timeout, timeout, grabs a stool, brings it on the court.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.660]   Everyone has to huddle up here.
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.820]   And then he says, "You know that those who are regarded
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.420]   "as rulers of the Gentiles, lord it over them.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.340]   "And their high officials exercise authority over them.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.400]   "Not so with you.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.600]   "Instead, whoever wants to become great among you
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.780]   "must be your servant.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:19.480]   "And whoever wants to be first must be slave of all.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.100]   "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served,
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:27.100]   "but to serve and to give his life as ransom for many."
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:32.320]   And Jesus says, look, we lead, not positionally.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   With our titles and our thrones and our corner offices,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.860]   we lead sacrificially, he says.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.580]   We give ourselves away.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.840]   The last moment we might be familiar with
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.040]   because we saw it in the opening sermon
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.680]   of this entire series.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.320]   They're entering into Jericho.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.280]   There's a loud buzz because Jesus is there.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.760]   There's a blind man who's the son of Timaeus.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.280]   His name is Bartimaeus.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.280]   And he's sitting by the road and he hears the buzz
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   and he starts crying out 'cause he hears that it's because
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:13.080]   of this rabbi named Jesus who has the power to heal.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.560]   And he just starts crying out,
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.620]   Son of David, have mercy on me.
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.560]   Son of David, have mercy on me.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:19.920]   And everyone starts telling him,
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.160]   be quiet, be quiet, be quiet.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.060]   We would say here in America, shut up, shut up, shut up.
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.680]   And they're pushing him away.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.380]   And Jesus says, bring him to me.
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:37.880]   And then the disciples go to him and say this powerful,
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.800]   three little words, it's just so beautiful.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.800]   It's actually framed our entire one campaign series together.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.640]   Cheer up, on your feet, he's calling you.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.800]   And this man gets healed.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.320]   Jesus says, what do you want me to do for you?
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:55.960]   He says, I wanna receive sight.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.760]   And he's healed in that moment.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.660]   But think about that moment.
[00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:03.840]   This man is so desperate.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.440]   He's off to the side.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.120]   He's probably just inhaling the dust that's being kicked up
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.180]   from all the feet that are just trampling
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.040]   to jockey themselves to Jesus by access, by power,
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.320]   by all these things.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.000]   And he's just crying out and he refuses to stop.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.760]   And Jesus, just like he saw the rich young ruler,
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.420]   he hears this man.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.000]   And what do we learn about this?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.600]   In this very moment, we learn that in the world scorecard,
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.660]   some people are expendable.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:40.280]   But in the scorecard of Jesus,
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.320]   here's a word we've been using a lot.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:46.200]   Everyone is essential.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:52.040]   Born with the image of God, made with the dignity of God.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   Now I want you just to look for a moment at this list.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.120]   The world says it's gotta be about you.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.180]   You gotta be on top.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.360]   It's about dividing and conquering through competition.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.680]   It's about dismissing others in marriage
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.340]   or any other relationship.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.520]   It's about hierarchy.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.480]   Where are you in the pecking order
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.260]   and on the rungs of the ladder?
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.360]   It's about prosperity, right?
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.540]   Just gain, gain more, right?
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.960]   As if you think it's gonna fill yourself up.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.080]   It's about positional power
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.880]   and it's about seeing other people
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:35.780]   through a value rubric of some are more valuable
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.700]   all the way to others are expendable.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.680]   This is the scorecard that you and I,
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.720]   that we're handed every single day in our lives.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:47.960]   And we have a decision to make.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.760]   Are we gonna live by that scorecard?
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:55.260]   And I bet if you thought through your work life,
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.000]   if you thought through your government system,
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.480]   like we do here,
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.680]   basically pick your sector, pick your industry,
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.320]   pick your habitat, pick even in your home.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.040]   And frankly, it's very sad,
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.480]   but we can even see this played out in the church, can't we?
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.600]   And where does this lead?
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.320]   Where's the scorecard lead?
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.900]   On a playground, it leads to bullying.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:28.900]   In a boardroom, politicking, power plays.
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.740]   Geopolitically, war.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.580]   Socially, injustice.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:40.380]   If left to its own devices, to its furthest extreme,
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.420]   genocide.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.920]   Because the scorecard is based on power.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:58.340]   Richard Foster, the great Quaker writer in his book
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.860]   that was at least once titled Money, Sex, and Power
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.820]   writes this about power.
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.740]   He says this.
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:11.160]   "Power can destroy or it can create.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.140]   "The power that destroys demands ascendancy,
[00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.100]   "it demands total control.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.340]   "It destroys relationships, it destroys trust,
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.020]   "it destroys dialogue, it destroys integrity.
[00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.420]   "And this is true whether you look through the macrocosm
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.520]   "of human history or the microcosm
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.300]   "of our own personal histories of you and me,
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.140]   "and even what happens in a marriage,
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.380]   "and even what happens between siblings,
[00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:41.260]   "and even what happens in a home or in a heart."
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.100]   What scorecard are you using for your life?
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:53.300]   Because I look at the scorecard of Jesus,
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.180]   and would you look with me here?
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.260]   It's like, would you like to live in a world
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.740]   where everyone says, how can I give myself away
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.860]   to the service of others today?
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.300]   Would you like to live in a world where everyone says,
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.300]   hey, if they're not against you, then let 'em be for you.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.780]   Like, let's seek out commonality with conviction.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.820]   Would you like to live in a world where everyone
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.740]   was just seen as a baseline of dignity,
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:21.260]   and if every marriage stayed that way and lived that way?
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:22.780]   Would you love to live in a world
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.620]   where in the corporate space, there was a sense of humility
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:31.040]   versus what we describe as the smartest guys in the room?
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.640]   Would you like to live in a world
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:33.920]   where people weren't just trying
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.900]   to accumulate wealth for themselves,
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:39.140]   but they felt this sense of beautiful responsibility
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:43.880]   to give what they have away to others, a generous world?
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.540]   Would you like to live in a world
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.720]   where leaders lead sacrificially,
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.100]   and they don't lord it over you?
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.820]   They go, how do I serve, how do I give myself away?
[00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.100]   Would you like to live in a world
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.700]   where everyone is essential?
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.980]   I do, and that's the invitation of Jesus for you and for me.
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.740]   When he rips up your old scorecard, he says,
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:07.740]   here, take this, and as we live this way,
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.180]   what happens as the spirit of God
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.100]   who forms and shapes this in you and me,
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.020]   well, what happens?
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:17.900]   Well, there's more love, the Bible says.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.980]   There's more joy, there's more peace.
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.700]   There's greater patience, there's self-control,
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.780]   there's gentleness, forbearance.
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:29.420]   All the beautiful things that exist in heaven
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:33.340]   all the time today break into your life and my life,
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:35.500]   and if we look over,
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.180]   history, human history, particularly the last 2,000 years,
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.900]   and say, who's led this way?
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.020]   Who's led this way?
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.940]   The early church led this way.
[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.660]   They'd go through trash heaps to find babies
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.860]   that had been abandoned,
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.300]   and they'd bring them, nurse them back to life,
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.040]   and take them in as their own.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.980]   They were advocates for the outcasts,
[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.820]   for the disenfranchised, the women, poor.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.500]   They broke through hierarchy and status,
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.780]   hierarchy and status and layers to care.
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.060]   More modern examples as we go throughout history,
[00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:15.980]   Father Damien, who literally went to the lepers
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.420]   and brought the love of Jesus.
[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:22.160]   Hudson Taylor, who brought the love of Christ to Asia.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.940]   Jackie Pollinger, who with $10 in her pocket
[00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.380]   arrived in the walled city in Hong Kong
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:31.740]   to care for opium addicts.
[00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:34.660]   Martin Luther King, who all the pressure
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:36.780]   was to just like fight, fight, fight,
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.460]   and he's like, no, nonviolence,
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.220]   and bring the love of Jesus.
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.760]   Nelson Mandela, after years and years of apartheid,
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.740]   when everyone's crying for revenge,
[00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:48.860]   says, no, we're gonna seek reconciliation.
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.660]   William Wilberforce leveraged his status
[00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:58.140]   and his power to see the abolishment of slavery.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:03.140]   Mother Teresa in the slums of Calcutta,
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:06.300]   saying, Jesus, how can I bring your scorecard
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:12.300]   to the expendable, to those who have been dismissed?
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:18.840]   Dave, a business partner here in Kansas City,
[00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.620]   a business friend of mine, who has a lot of money,
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.480]   a lot of status, and a lot of employees,
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.060]   and he says to them, let me be your assistant.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:26.880]   What do you need?
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.940]   I wanna serve you.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:31.420]   April, who came alongside quietly,
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.940]   without telling anyone, she's a mom,
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.620]   she lives in a very nice part of town here in Kansas City,
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.840]   but there was a man in our church named Steve
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.420]   who's confined to a wheelchair,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.140]   can barely even lift himself up with his arms,
[00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.620]   can barely even shower, take care of himself,
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:47.540]   and lives alone.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:52.540]   And so every other week, she just quietly goes across town
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:57.580]   to his apartment, cleans it, cooks me a meal,
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:02.460]   cooks meals, helps him with the things that he needs.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.580]   See, that's winning.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.360]   That's living by a different scorecard.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.860]   I just wanna ask you, I just wanna say this.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:19.360]   What from this scorecard of the world
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.960]   do you just need to see eradicated from your life?
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.220]   And I'll share with you for me right now.
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.840]   I have the privilege of being
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.520]   one of the teaching pastors here,
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   but I also have started a business in the last year.
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.720]   And I'm being challenged right here.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:43.040]   I'm being challenged, but okay,
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.220]   what scorecard am I gonna live by?
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.920]   What is the challenge for you?
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:54.080]   And conversely, what do you want to experience more of
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.800]   from the scorecard of Jesus?
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.080]   And we would just simply say, Holy Spirit,
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.320]   whatever that is, Holy Spirit,
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.760]   would you gift me with more of your humility?
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.520]   Would you gift me with more of the ability
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.960]   to see commonality?
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.920]   Jesus, would you gift me with a generous spirit
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.920]   by your spirit?
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   Whatever that is, we just simply ask him for it.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.880]   And maybe, maybe you're going,
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.000]   maybe you're going, aren't we skipping a step?
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.400]   Maybe you thought that this was the only scorecard
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.160]   available to you in your life.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:39.280]   You didn't even know this whole other world
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.640]   and opportunity exists.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:44.840]   You didn't know that Jesus actually wants to be your coach.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.080]   And if that's the case,
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.960]   and if when we describe this kind of world,
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.520]   and then I asked you, would you like to live in that world?
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.920]   Would you like to experience those things?
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.320]   Would you like to have this true in your home,
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.320]   in your marriage, at your place of work?
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.480]   And if something rose up in you,
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   then I would just tell you this,
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.200]   it's time to change teams.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.520]   It's time to have a new coach.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.160]   His name is Jesus.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:12.120]   And he looks at you and he goes, you're not a four.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.560]   Like on every single mark, he goes, because of me,
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.560]   my life, my death, my resurrection, you're a 10.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.440]   You're a 10.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.840]   That's my scorecard for you.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.120]   I've already pre-scored you at the cross.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.840]   And man, there's so much beauty there.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:30.840]   So much freedom there.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:36.880]   And actually, I want you to hear from my friend Ryan Hoover,
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.760]   who also lives here in Kansas City.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.040]   We get to hang out in our small group.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.920]   We call it an A2 community.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.840]   We meet every Wednesday morning for prayer together.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.720]   And graciously, he's decided to join me.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.080]   So I wanna bring out Il Soldato.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:57.080]   So KFCI, would you please just give him a warm welcome?
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:05.360]   Well, Ryan Hoover, thank you so much
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.000]   for joining us here today.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:07.840]   - Yeah, Dave.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.760]   - Yeah.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.200]   Well, so man, there's so much we could talk about,
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.600]   but what I haven't yet shared
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.680]   is that right before you switched your scorecard,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.240]   you went to Hong Kong to play in an All-Star game.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.400]   And just for fun,
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.760]   what was the level of talent out there in Hong Kong?
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.400]   - Well, I don't really remember much
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.680]   about what led up to that time,
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.120]   but I think in my mind,
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.480]   I thought America was the best in basketball,
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.360]   which I think we are,
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.360]   but I was really surprised by the level of talent
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.600]   and the competition that we faced when we got to Hong Kong.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.800]   - So you kind of just lackadaisically entered the court
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.640]   and all of a sudden you're like,
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.360]   "Oh, I better bring my A game."
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.600]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.600]   - Well, what's also interesting to me about that time,
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.200]   this is 1997, it's the summer of 1997,
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.480]   and it was just months before
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.740]   you ripped up your old scorecard
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.080]   and you took the scorecard of Jesus.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.520]   You gave your life to Jesus.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.040]   Describe that moment,
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:10.520]   and maybe even what was leading up to that for you?
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:15.400]   Like the time of living by this old world scorecard,
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.440]   what was that like?
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.980]   - Yeah, I think just growing up,
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.840]   I had the dream and I had goals that I was going after
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.720]   in terms of getting a college scholarship
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.040]   and playing basketball.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.080]   It was based around that,
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.160]   and it was about just being the best at what I was,
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:32.680]   and I was obsessed with being the best shooter in the world,
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.840]   and every day I approached it like that,
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.400]   but it was about me,
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.000]   and it was about me reaching my goals,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.720]   and that's really all I cared about.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.160]   I didn't really have an awareness of what else was there,
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.560]   so I kind of just went in with every opportunity
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.080]   just going after it like that.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.760]   - And for all of us in our lives,
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.840]   whether it's basketball or business
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.880]   or whatever our pursuits,
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.560]   at some point we kind of come to,
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.600]   we get in touch with that emptiness maybe,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.120]   or we come up against to the limit of ourselves,
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.940]   and we don't quite have the answers
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:09.800]   that we thought that we did,
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:12.680]   and we go, "Is there something more?
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.520]   "Am I missing something?"
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.840]   Did that happen for you?
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.480]   - Yeah, interestingly enough,
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.940]   that's how God grew me and drew me to himself,
[00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.520]   was through the game of basketball.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.680]   So what had become my God and my idol,
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.560]   he used it to draw me to himself,
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.120]   and then I experienced him in a real way,
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.240]   and his authority and his availability
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.220]   became an experience for me,
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.020]   not that I heard stories about other people
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.340]   or that I read in the book or the Bible
[00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.940]   that I was taught, but it became real to me,
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.300]   and it was interesting that it was
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:49.320]   through the game of basketball,
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:51.820]   and it was around the time that I was in Hong Kong.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.620]   - Well, and you grew up in a church,
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:56.500]   so you knew Bible stories and things like that,
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.220]   but you were invited into something more,
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.740]   and can you describe that?
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.080]   I know you were with a group called Athletes in Action,
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.820]   which was kind of a professional ministry
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:10.260]   of professional basketball players who loved Jesus,
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.700]   and it was actually, you said yes,
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.740]   but not even quite knowing what you were signing up for
[00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:15.940]   at the time, right?
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.300]   - Yeah, I just wanted to play basketball.
[00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.860]   It was another opportunity for me
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:23.340]   to play against good competition and hone my skills.
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.460]   So yeah, it was just interesting how God used
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.540]   that opportunity with Athletes in Action.
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.660]   I went to Shanghai a couple months later
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.620]   after my experience in Hong Kong,
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.580]   so I got another Asian experience,
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:40.060]   and it was another one that kind of helped me to grow,
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.260]   not only on the court, but off the court,
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.260]   and then I joined a tour with Athletes in Action
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.300]   back in the US where we played the college teams,
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.540]   and that was when I came to the Lord,
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:55.500]   and I was with a group that helped me process
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.660]   what I was going through as I was still going after my goals.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:00.820]   I was still going after my dreams,
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.500]   but now in a new way with a new scorecard.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.860]   - Yeah, I love it, 'cause you were in between contracts.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.920]   Sure, I'll go play, and if we talk about Jesus
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:11.180]   with folks during halftime, that's fine, right?
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:13.580]   But then it was the relationships of the guys on this team
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.020]   that just started asking you questions
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.060]   you couldn't quite answer, right?
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:21.820]   - Yeah, and I just, I had to ask myself the hard questions,
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.660]   and then finally I just went to the Lord,
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:25.420]   and I said, "What's going on?"
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.820]   And I wrote a letter and everything,
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.620]   and I experienced Him in a real way,
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.900]   and my path took a whole new route after that,
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.660]   and as you talk about the scorecard, it was the same thing.
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:41.020]   A lot of these things on this side started popping up,
[00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:44.560]   and I became aware of my selfishness and my pride
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.020]   and my, a little bit of arrogance, you know,
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:52.020]   that started to shift, and it's still shifting.
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.940]   - Yes. - Still in my life today.
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.740]   You know, as I transitioned out of basketball
[00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.140]   into the business world, I still deal with these things,
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.560]   you know, in terms of that, and God continues
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.380]   to make me aware of my weaknesses
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.980]   and His power through my weakness,
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.980]   and so, yeah, it's a consistent work in progress,
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.460]   you know, it's ongoing.
[00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.900]   - Well, and what I love now is that you're giving
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.740]   your life to others, and yes,
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.580]   this is why we need the Holy Spirit, right,
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.940]   just to say, would you continue to purge
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.500]   the old world scorecard from us
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.900]   and empower us to live in a new way?
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.660]   But bro, I see that in you every day as your close friend,
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.780]   and I see how you're giving yourself away,
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:42.140]   and you today are working with professional athletes
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:46.980]   on basically this very thing.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.100]   You had shared a story about a very famous athlete
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.180]   within the NBA named Wayne Simian,
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.300]   and we have his permission to share the story,
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.660]   but can you just kind of share,
[00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:01.740]   as you're working with a player today in Spain,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.260]   a story that Wayne told you that really connects here?
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.740]   - Yeah, I think it resonates with a lot of us
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:10.420]   like high-pressure athletes, you know, like goal-driven,
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.140]   so what happened was what you showed earlier
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:16.980]   on the scorecard was what the media does,
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.100]   but in the game, there's an actual stat sheet
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.980]   that tells rebounds, assists, turnovers,
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.180]   steals, points, all the stats of the game,
[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.780]   and a lot of times, what us players do
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.260]   is we go right in the locker room,
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.020]   and the first thing we grab
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.460]   is we wanna see the score sheet.
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.700]   We wanna see the stat sheet.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:37.820]   We wanna see how we did.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.860]   - How did you do?
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:43.220]   - Yeah, exactly, so our eyes go right to us, right?
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.620]   And I think that's natural.
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:49.300]   If you ask any pro athlete, that's probably how did I do?
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:54.220]   And so what that causes is if you have a bad game,
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.180]   if you have a good game, there's good feelings,
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.240]   and you're happy, and you win, and all that,
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.060]   but if there's a bad game, you can kinda go in the dumps,
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.780]   and what one of my friends, Wayne Simeon, said was,
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.740]   "I stopped going into my locker when I sat down.
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.540]   "I didn't grab the stat sheet.
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.840]   "I grabbed a note card that had all the truth
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.540]   "in the scripture about who I am in God's view."
[00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.380]   - Wow.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.620]   - And so he changed the stat,
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.860]   like literally changed the stat sheet.
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.740]   - Scorecard switch. - And he picked up
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.540]   this scorecard and started going to the truth.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.060]   I am the light of the world.
[00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.660]   I am God's child.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.540]   I am his son.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.420]   I am a heir.
[00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.100]   I'm a co-heir with Jesus,
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.300]   and he started just going down the scripture
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.860]   of this scorecard and the truth in the scriptures,
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.580]   and I think that kinda raised my awareness
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:49.340]   to what I was doing as a player, and I'm still doing,
[00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:51.180]   and how I can shift into that,
[00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.860]   and I think a lot of players,
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.860]   that would resonate, that story, and it has,
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:57.780]   as I've been talking to other pro players.
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.460]   - Yeah, and I think whether you're a business leader,
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.460]   whether you work at home, wherever we are, we can relate.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.260]   We all have a scorecard,
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.460]   and that's the first thing that we go to,
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:14.140]   and that's the invitation for all of us.
[00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:15.980]   I love that you wrote a letter, you said.
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.820]   Did you write that to God?
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:19.140]   I know you got baptized later.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.540]   Was that letter written to God?
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.500]   - Mm-hmm, yeah.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.220]   I wish I still had it, but I think it was just empty,
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.740]   basically just the confession
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:27.420]   of how I'd been living my life,
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.740]   and what I wanted.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:33.100]   I wanted more of him, and less of what I'd been going after,
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:37.540]   and so, yeah, that relationship took on a whole new meaning,
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.580]   and it continues to grow day by day.
[00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:42.820]   - Well, I know God still has that letter.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.340]   We'll get to see it in the kingdom one day, my brother.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.980]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.420]   Hey, would you just join me in saying thank you to Ryan
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.180]   for sharing his story?
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.700]   So, thank you so much, Ryan.
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.540]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.940]   It was a pleasure to be here.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.700]   - Awesome.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.980]   Well, as Ryan transitions,
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.300]   let me just go ahead and give his email out
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.740]   so that you can send your complaint
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.220]   about his preference for American basketball.
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.700]   I really wanna say sorry for that, Hong Kong,
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:16.500]   but isn't that a beautiful thing, though?
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:21.260]   A real-life story of someone who has learned
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:23.780]   and is learning how to say,
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.660]   "Jesus, you keep a different score,
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:31.660]   "and it's a radical score, and it's filled with grace,
[00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.880]   "and where I might feel like a two in my life,
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.600]   "you say I'm a 10,
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.120]   "where I might feel like I'm a negative 18,
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:42.040]   "you say, hey, listen, you can't score any higher
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:44.200]   "because of my love for you."
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.720]   Jesus looks at you,
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:49.140]   just like he looked at the rich young ruler.
[00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:52.860]   Jesus hears you if you're feeling trampled
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.580]   by all those passing by,
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.240]   and he says, "You're essential.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.420]   "You were born with the dignity
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.360]   "since before the foundations of the world.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.420]   "You're a 10 in my heart."
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.740]   And that's why I went to this place called Planet Earth,
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.280]   that's why I surrendered my life.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.240]   All the things that Jesus did are right here.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.280]   He said, "I'm gonna go last.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:22.500]   "I'm gonna seek solidarity and commonality with you
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:26.120]   "as human beings, being fully God and fully human,
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.620]   "and I'm gonna give my life away,
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.900]   "and I'm gonna abandon the grave on the third day."
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:31.740]   Why?
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:32.800]   Because you are essential.
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.560]   All that I have created and called good and very good
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.840]   is essential, and I'm taking it back for good.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.220]   That's the invitation.
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.720]   The call of Jesus, I'm keeping a different score,
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.800]   and it's time to change teams.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.040]   So cheer up, O church.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.040]   On your feet, he's calling you to a new scorecard,
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.020]   because that's the new way that we win.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.720]   In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.160]   we say and pray together, amen.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:16.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
