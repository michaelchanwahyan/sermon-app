[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.760]   I wish I was talking to you face to face, but hey, I offer technology.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.760]   I want to start at the very beginning.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:23.920]   I want to look at the very first book of the Bible, in fact, the second chapter.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:32.880]   And look at this verse, the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.520]   it and take care of it.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.800]   Yes, work was God's idea.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.120]   Work was God's idea.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.640]   God created mankind to work and are created in his image.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.320]   Work should be considered a blessing.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.160]   But what you might not appreciate is just how much I am excited by the whole subject
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.280]   of workplace and faith.
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:21.080]   One caveat, my heart is so full, I will not be able to do it justice in one sermon.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:30.280]   And I'm so excited that Anthony will be speaking to us next week without a TA, hopefully.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.800]   That picture tells a million stories.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.240]   It's a businessman, a businessman turned pastor.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.520]   I came to Hong Kong as a businessman.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.800]   I loved my job.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.560]   I was general manager for the Hong Kong operation of AXA, one of the world's largest insurance
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.680]   companies.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.480]   I was a businessman longer than I have been a pastor.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.960]   Thirty three years, three months and three days.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.880]   Well, not exactly, but it sounds good, doesn't it?
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.920]   And I'm often asked the question.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.800]   How long have you been in full time ministry?
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.680]   And my answer.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.520]   Is I have always been in full time ministry.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.880]   The truth is, I reached more people for Christ.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.880]   In the insurance industry, as the guy on the left of your screen.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.760]   Then I do as a pastor.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.560]   I spend far too much of my time now as a pastor with Christians.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:11.200]   And I want to start off this evening by destroying the sort of myths that had me one day working
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.000]   for Mammon.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.600]   And the next day having a permanent halo on my head.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:35.960]   Church history has consistently been ready to put everything into two boxes.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.520]   Sacred and sacred.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.280]   Church was a building you went to.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.720]   Communities were the things you did there.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.880]   Clergy were the people who delivered them.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.720]   For much of church history, they were male.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.600]   And perhaps just a little bit boring.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.320]   I just want to put it there.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.480]   This has not been my experience.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:20.120]   And as I reread the Bible, we have no authority to do so.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:28.080]   In the early 80s, I was a successful sales manager of a UK insurance company, a subsidiary
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.840]   of a merchant bank.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:39.760]   When in my late 20s, I realized I got practically everything the world could throw at me.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:48.440]   But yet had a gaping chasm in my heart, a Christ-shaped hole, to be precise.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.640]   I first saw this in other people who had clearly found something I didn't have and something
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.440]   I was looking for.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:07.000]   So I recommitted my life, manifested in taking adult confirmation classes in my suburban
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.040]   Anglican church in the UK.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:19.720]   But what happened was that the workplace became my mission field from day one.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   As everyone was curious what had happened to me.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:32.040]   Although I was the company's leading sales manager, my lifestyle had become decidedly
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.720]   self-absorbed.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:41.600]   To be honest, a foul-mouthed, driven workaholic.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:51.560]   But now I had a new boss and was willing to follow him to the ends of the earth.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:06:01.920]   Literally, in 1987, I was asked to consider taking my family, my wife, Sandra, my two
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:10.960]   sons, Paul and Matt, even my sheepdog, Bella, to Hong Kong for three years to start an investment
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.120]   services company for National Mutual, our new parent company.
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.120]   Now our only previous visit to Hong Kong was in 1981.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.960]   We were staying at the Regent Hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.680]   We walked down Nathan Road and saw the people and my wife, Sandra, said, "You'll never get
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.520]   me to live here a million years."
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:46.320]   Now our arrival was actually coincident with the famous stock market crash of 1987.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.040]   It was called Black Monday.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:56.160]   I ended up with what I describe as trying to sell ice creams to Eskimos here.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.900]   It was the toughest period of my whole business life.
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.600]   It was humbling.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.880]   Now I wish I could tell you the whole story, but suffice to say, in that time, God gave
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:19.480]   me a vision for Hong Kong, a love for Hong Kong, and a vision for his church, and particular
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.360]   for evangelism.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:29.160]   And 35 years later, I'm still here.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:38.360]   And I can give testimony to 35 years of God's grace and him using this insurance man turned
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.480]   pastor to help build his kingdom here.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:54.240]   I want to give credit here to the Union Church, who in 1995 allowed an insurance man with
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:05.240]   no pastoral experience to deliver live talks on their new course at the time.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   It was a course called Alpha.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:16.360]   Alpha, something I am still doing by God's grace today.
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:29.600]   It was there that I first gained experience of delivering messages in church.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:38.920]   My thinking on this topic has been heavily shaped by Ed Silvozo's book, Anointed for
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.440]   Jesus.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:48.440]   Actually, I always secretly wanted to be a pastor.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:54.840]   Now this book and the group of people that I gathered around me to study it, we were
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:02.000]   called FISH, F-I-S-H, Fellowship of Insurance Staff in Hong Kong.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:13.240]   It told me that I already was a pastor, that all work was worship, and every Christian
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.720]   is a minister.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.880]   I was in reality a marketplace pastor.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:30.720]   I learned through this book and through this time that every business is God's business.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:38.400]   The notion that labor for profit and worship of God are now and have always been God's
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.680]   a part is absolutely false.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.160]   There is no sacred and secular divide.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:59.480]   Look at this, the early church founders, mostly community leaders and highly successful business
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:09.320]   people, the writing of the Gospels was entrusted to Luke, a doctor, Matthew, a retired tax
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:17.800]   collector, Mark, the manager of a family trust, and John, a food supplier, FISH actually.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:27.600]   In the book of Acts, Lydia was a dealer of purple cloth and Dorcas was a clothes designer.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:35.680]   I want to share a quote from Ken Costa, who was actually a speaker at a church at KFC.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.120]   He spoke one Saturday night.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.720]   He said this, "God loves you.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:47.400]   God loves the work he has called you to."
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.680]   Now I want to push this a bit further.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:59.320]   Ed Silvozo talks about what he calls four lethal misbeliefs.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:05.160]   What I want to do is I want to put my own slant on this.
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:12.080]   I've already hinted at this, that the first misbelief that there is a God-ordained division
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:17.500]   between clergy and laity.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:23.480]   As part of my doctoral studies, I had the privilege to study theology of work under
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:30.760]   visiting professor Paul Stevens from the Regent Seminary in Vancouver.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:39.640]   One of the things he said was this, "For Christians, the problem is that on one side of the line,
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:47.500]   there are Sunday things, I guess for us Saturday things, other worldly things, supernatural
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:53.060]   things, holy things, and spiritual things.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:12:03.140]   On the other side, there are unspiritual things, human things, natural things, this world things,
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.740]   and the things of everyday life."
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:16.820]   He said this, "This is the problem of dualism, that some things are sacred and some things
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.820]   are secular."
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:25.780]   He said this, "It is possibly the worst heresy in the Christian church worldwide."
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.500]   I mean, answer this question.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:35.060]   In the 1950s, missionaries came to the South part of Korea.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.500]   They did good work.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:44.780]   At the end of the war, the percentage of people who are Christians in South Korea had risen
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.620]   from 2% to 30%.
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:54.860]   Today there are 20,000 plus churches there, including some of the world's biggest.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.220]   I visited one of them.
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:02.140]   Won-yong Joido has 750,000 people attending.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:07.220]   At the same time, an author by the name of J.R.R.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:14.700]   Tolkien wrote the famous book, Lord of the Rings, and the children's story, The Hobbit.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:22.500]   The question is, which one is sacred and which one is secular?
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:31.020]   Which work would the Lord have called worthier and more sacred than the others?
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:37.020]   Here we have the sacred, secular dualism.
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.260]   Church services are sacred.
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:43.380]   Company offices are not.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:51.100]   Quiet times are sacred, but eating, sleeping, and resting are secular.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:59.740]   Prayer meetings, of course, are sacred, but political action is secular.
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:12.700]   Reading the Bible or witnessing is sacred, but reading the newspaper is secular.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:22.980]   The problem is the tragic separation of Sunday, or in this case, Saturday, and Monday to Friday.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:28.180]   Church life is separated from ordinary life.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:32.220]   State life is separated from public life.
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.100]   Inner life is separated from outer life.
[00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.780]   And belief is separated from behavior.
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:51.140]   The apostle Paul, in his writings, never said that people go to church to worship.
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:57.500]   Paul believed that we are worshipping God all the time.
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:05.380]   I don't think there is a part-time option for followers of Jesus.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:13.260]   One thing people always ask me is, how was I able to make the transition between working
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:18.540]   for an insurance company and a church?
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:24.580]   And the truth is, I don't actually know how to answer it.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:30.020]   You might call me naive, but to me, there was no difference.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:38.380]   Both were primarily about people, and most importantly, both were about serving and glorifying
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:39.380]   God.
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:44.260]   I love this quote from famous inventor Thomas Edison.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:52.860]   He said, "We often miss opportunity because it's dressed in overalls and looks like work."
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:57.540]   So let me move on to the second lethal belief.
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:04.460]   And it's this, that the church is called to operate primarily inside a building, often
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:08.100]   referred to as a temple.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:17.460]   Now the old cliche, Christians don't go to church, they are the church, is arguably trite,
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.460]   but it's true.
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:24.140]   And we've just spent six weeks on a series talking about it.
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:30.620]   It's unoriginal, but it is far from unimportant.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:37.940]   When people are not sleeping, most of their time is spent working.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.940]   Think about it.
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:46.540]   The average Christian spends less than 2% of their waking time at church.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:55.020]   Yet the church puts most of its energy and resources into that 2%, and very little into
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.060]   the world of daily work.
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:10.540]   I want to show you a Bible verse that we probably, all of us, read incorrectly.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:16.420]   This is the NIV, Matthew 16, 18.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:23.260]   And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church, and the
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:28.860]   gates of Hades, or the gates of hell, will not overcome it.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.860]   Now some background here.
[00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:36.020]   Jesus had asked his disciples who people were saying he was.
[00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:42.060]   And while with others waffling about John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, or one of the
[00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:48.380]   prophets, Simon Peter has a gift of faith and declares, "You are the Messiah, the Son
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.100]   of the living God."
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:18:02.420]   Then Jesus says, "I will build my church."
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.220]   Or does he?
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.260]   Maybe he does in English.
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:12.820]   Maybe he does in the NIV.
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:19.500]   And every other translation, to be honest, I looked at more than 20 translations to see
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.500]   this.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.420]   But watch this.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:34.500]   The Greek word, "ekklesia," means an assembly of people convened at the public place of
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.220]   counsel for the purpose of the liberating.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.700]   I guess it's like a town hall today.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:46.220]   It's a term that comes from the marketplace.
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.940]   Jesus did not say, "I will build my temple.
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.380]   I will build my synagogue."
[00:18:53.380 --> 00:19:02.380]   There were specific Greek words for them, and Jesus chose not to use them.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:11.580]   We have embraced and perpetuated a culture around this single word, a word that was never
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:17.580]   spoken by Jesus.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.900]   Let me look at it another way.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.020]   I started off by talking about Alpha.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.340]   I've got a confession to make to you.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:32.020]   I am a complete alphaholic.
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:41.180]   In his talk about "What About the Church," Nicky Gumbel describes five images and metaphors
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.780]   to describe the church.
[00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:52.220]   They are the people of God, the family of God, the body of Christ, a holy temple, the
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.540]   bride of Christ.
[00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:59.020]   Now, if you want to find out more, you'll need to come on the next KFCI Alpha in the
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.020]   autumn.
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:11.980]   But I can tell you that none of these refer to what we commonly call church.
[00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.940]   I want to look once again, without apology, at the passage we've been studying for the
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.180]   past two months.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.620]   It's in Acts 2.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:27.060]   They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship and to the breaking of bread
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.820]   and to prayer.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:34.420]   Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.900]   All the believers were together and had everything in common.
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.660]   They sold property and possessions to give to anyone who had need.
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.140]   Every day, they continued to meet together in the temple courts.
[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:48.740]   They broke bread in their homes.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:54.780]   They ate together with glad and sincere hearts, praising God and enjoying the favor of all
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:55.780]   the people.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:04.340]   And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.020]   Numbers were added daily.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.740]   And where do we go daily?
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:17.780]   I guarantee it is not the first floor of the Far East Finance Center.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:23.740]   My friends, the church has left the building.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:29.140]   Ed Silvozo says this, "As long as we believe that the church was born within four walls,
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:36.320]   we will always need four walls to have a church."
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.460]   My third lethal misbelief is this.
[00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:47.780]   People involved in business cannot be as spiritual as those serving in traditional
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.900]   church ministry.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:58.500]   One of my favorite all-time Christian books is The Call.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.380]   It's written by a guy called Oz Guinness, whom I had the pleasure to meet on a number
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:06.460]   of occasions, most recently, about a year ago on Zoom.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:15.300]   He says this, "No idea short of God's call can ground and fulfill the truest human desire
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.940]   for purpose and fulfillment."
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:29.900]   Now the Christian world often mistakes the word "call" from being called to what we all
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.300]   call full-time ministry.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.460]   That is wrong.
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:42.940]   My friends, I need to tell you something.
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:47.220]   You are called.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:49.500]   Let me say that again.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.380]   You are called.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:23:01.660]   Whether you're a preacher or people call you a super apostle or you're a bank manager,
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:10.780]   a school teacher or a full-time mom, whether you minister to drug addicts and street sleepers,
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:18.700]   or you wash dishes in a cha-chang tank, you are called.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:27.500]   The fear of repeating myself, when people ask, "When was I called to the ministry?"
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:35.220]   I do not see my transfer from my office in AXA in Wanchai to my office in the Vine in
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.220]   Lankwai Fong.
[00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.820]   Yeah, yeah, we had our office in Lankwai Fong.
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:47.860]   A flash of lightning in the sky or a spiritual awakening, but rather a working out of a calling
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.540]   that was already there.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.420]   I'll go further.
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:58.420]   We not only have a general calling, which is represented by the Great Commission, we
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:02.100]   each have a specific calling.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:09.980]   Even when I became a pastor, God gave me a specific call to church unity and a specific
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:16.220]   call to raise up the next generation, which I hold to this day.
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.860]   Ken Costa again wrote this.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:25.240]   The God who created and sustains the world is also the God of the workplace.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:34.340]   If the Christian faith is not relevant in the workplace, it is not relevant at all.
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.900]   Now think about it.
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:44.340]   Jesus lived on the earth 33 years.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:50.260]   Only three of them were in what we call ministry.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:56.180]   He was the carpenter's son.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.660]   He was born in the marketplace.
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:05.060]   It wasn't difficult for Jesus' neighbors to see him as a businessman, as many would have
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.340]   purchased his products.
[00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:16.660]   Most of Jesus' followers remain in full-time business while simultaneously conducting full-time
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.380]   ministry.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:25.020]   This was possible because they saw the marketplace as their parish and their business as their
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.020]   pulpit.
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:33.740]   To them, witnessing was not an occasional activity, but a lifestyle.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:40.260]   The book of Acts unfolds the story of believers who did more than tell people about Jesus
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:42.140]   in the marketplace.
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:47.700]   They witnessed a steady stream of signs and wonders.
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:57.700]   In fact, only one of the 40 extraordinary manifestations of God's power recorded in
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:04.220]   the book of Acts actually occurred in a religious venue, the healing of the lame man at the
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.460]   temple gate called Beautiful.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:14.740]   Most of these spiritual wonders were facilitated by people such as Paul, Priscilla, and Aquila,
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:22.260]   who as ministry and business partners are classic examples of marketplace Christians.
[00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:30.540]   Today, millions of people, millions of men and women are similarly called to full-time
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:39.220]   ministry in business, education, and government, the marketplace.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:46.900]   Unfortunately, many of these marketplace Christians feel like second-class citizens when compared
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:51.900]   to people who serve full-time in the church or in a ministry context.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.500]   This should not be the case.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:03.140]   It is imperative that they realize that it's not only okay to do ministry in the marketplace,
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:09.940]   but that God has explicitly called them and anointed them for it.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:16.620]   By anointed, I mean they have been chosen and empowered by the Holy Spirit for a divinely
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:18.280]   sanctioned assignment.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.740]   By ministry, I mean they can do more than just witness.
[00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:29.380]   They can bring transformation to their jobs and then to their cities as happened in the
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:33.660]   first century.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:40.140]   Most marketplace Christians already know that their ministry and their occupation are somehow
[00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:48.020]   connected, but they do not comprehend exactly how.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:54.060]   American author Jean E. Veith says this, "The priesthood of all believers did not make everybody
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.060]   into church workers.
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:04.260]   Rather, it turned every kind of work into a sacred calling."
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.380]   My friends, put that on your fridge.
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:12.660]   I guess we all grew up thinking that the primary, sorry, I want to give you the fourth misconception
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:13.660]   first.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:19.380]   The fourth misconception is the primary role of marketplace Christians is to make money
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:25.700]   to support the vision of those in the ministry.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.700]   So let's go back one.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:34.340]   I guess we all grew up thinking that the primary purpose of business people in the church was
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:39.740]   to earn the money to pay their tithes so that the pastor could do the ministry stuff.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.420]   In particular, the Sunday church service and the sermon.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.260]   One prays, the other pays, right?
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:55.500]   I want to use this last section to encourage the church to take seriously its role of equipping
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   the marketplace.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:05.100]   It is, I believe, the key to the transformation of our city, the transformation of Hong Kong,
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:11.660]   and the events of the last two to three years have, I believe, prepared our hearts and churches
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.660]   for this.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.220]   I remember a Hong Kong Sunday school teacher saying this to me.
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:25.660]   I spend 45 minutes a week teaching Sunday school, and they call me up to the front of
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:29.100]   the church and they pray for me.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:40.580]   The rest of the week, I'm a full-time teacher, and the church has never prayed for me.
[00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.860]   My friends, that breaks my heart.
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:55.260]   Church, we desperately need a rethink.
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:02.340]   Green churches are churches that have a vision of God at work where their people work, that
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:09.580]   connect daily work to worship, that address the opportunities and challenges that people
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:16.460]   face at work, that invest resources in equipping people for their work, that create structures
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:23.040]   to sustain workplace ministry, release and support their people for work outside the
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:31.820]   church building, and they encourage everyone to take responsibility.
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:38.500]   I want to share with you a story that only came to me this week, but it's such an encouragement
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:44.580]   to me as I prepared to pray this.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:48.380]   This lady is called Andrea.
[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:58.540]   Andrea, I used to work at the same company with 35 years ago.
[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.180]   I haven't seen her since.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.300]   In fact, actually, as I told you, I was in the sales office.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.220]   She was an executive secretary.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.860]   I didn't know her very well.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.660]   We were connected through Facebook, I think mainly because her and her husband actually
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.100]   moved to Spain and we moved to Hong Kong.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:23.900]   She wrote to me this week, "Hi, John, just a quick message to ask if you could include
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.860]   me in your prayers.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:34.820]   I have terminal cancer and I have been told I haven't much time left.
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:40.660]   A prayer for me would be such a comfort.
[00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.900]   Bless you."
[00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:47.620]   Somebody I haven't seen for 35 years.
[00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.900]   Of course, I got straight back to her and said, "I need to pray some bold prayers, but
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:58.100]   I need to be bold with you that this life is not all that it's about."
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:05.540]   I shared about Jesus and in coming to die for us and the gift of eternal life.
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:10.300]   As suggested, she prayed this prayer, it was a sinner's prayer.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:15.860]   She wrote back to me a few hours later to say, "I've prayed that prayer.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.100]   I feel so much better now."
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.620]   Then we prayed for her to receive the Holy Spirit as well.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.100]   She said this, "Bless you, John.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:33.140]   Your kindness has made me quite emotional, but I know I will be going to a wonderful
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.220]   place and talking to you each day."
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.060]   I promised to contact her every day.
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:44.580]   "It will make me stronger.
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:52.700]   Please none of you underestimate what you might do in your workplace or the people you
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.300]   contact.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:33:01.100]   The mom at the school gate, the person you see on the bus, the person at lunchtime.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:09.660]   Thirty-five years after I last worked at the same company of this lady, she this week has
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:18.780]   received Jesus as her Lord and Savior and knows that she has an eternal destiny."
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:26.460]   Would you take just one minute now, just in silence, to pray for Andrea?
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:32.180]   I told her tonight that our church was going to be praying for her.
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.140]   So pray in whatever way you like.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:41.700]   We're going to pray for Andrea, who is in a hospice in Watford in the UK, suffering
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:46.180]   from what the doctors have said is terminal cancer.
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:53.020]   Let's pray.
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.980]   I always finish my sermons with a challenge.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:05.940]   I want to finish today with a challenge for every one of you to be part of what I call
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.940]   a new breed.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:12.940]   Now, what do I mean by that?
[00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:23.460]   On the 28th of February 2006 at the Vine Centre in Central, Sandra and I received a prophecy
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:30.820]   from a preacher called Dr. Kingsley Fletcher that will shape our future ministry.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.700]   Part of it, I won't give it all to you.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.500]   He said that John and Sandra are part of a new breed that God is raising up around the
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.500]   world.
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.500]   Let go so that he becomes God.
[00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.060]   God will be teaching you things that some things God will ask you to do that you won't
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:52.060]   find in any textbook or anyone else doing.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.320]   This is not strange.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.840]   God will use your uniqueness and will make you to be stronger.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:05.660]   You will chase lasting impact in his kingdom.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:08.300]   Two months later, I was in New York City.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.380]   I woke early on the 21st of April.
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:13.260]   I was still jet lagged.
[00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.740]   And I sense God say this to me for the church in the marketplace.
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.060]   Please test it.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:26.540]   I say to you, church of the 21st century arise for you are a new breed.
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.500]   Have I not said, behold, I'm doing a new thing.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.460]   Have I not said, do not dwell on the past.
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.020]   Now is the time to take me for my word.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:41.180]   It will be manifested in you and will be a light for the whole world to see.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:44.500]   Business people, you are a new breed.
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.220]   I will teach you things you did not learn at business school.
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:54.020]   Your anointing, your new anointing has nothing to do with your ability, but has everything
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.020]   to do with your availability.
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.920]   Remember I am the Potter.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.480]   You are the clay.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.060]   You have nothing to fear from the potter's kiln.
[00:36:03.060 --> 00:36:08.100]   I am the expert craftsman and will mold you into the unique design I have for you.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.620]   I will give you a new heart and a new love for my church.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:16.140]   I will give you a supernatural love for your pastors and church leaders.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:20.700]   Do not try and mold your church leaders into the things you are expecting them to be.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.780]   Allow me to do this.
[00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:29.060]   They will not be persuaded by words, by formula or by clever persuasion, by the love that
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.860]   you show them.
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:36.220]   As you show them my love, they will gradually link arms with you and you will be able to
[00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:44.660]   approach the commission I have given you in the way that I have intended, hand in hand.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:50.100]   People will be attracted to this by the love you have for one another.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:53.860]   I will use this to change the world.
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:37:01.340]   This new breed will become world changers, but only to the extent that they have received
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:06.340]   and given manifested my love.
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:11.080]   The new breed does not construct walls.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.940]   It tears them down.
[00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:16.140]   The new breed does not fight for territory.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.620]   It opens its borders.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:30.700]   The new breed has no agenda except for that one who has ordained this new season.
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:40.540]   I say to you, arise, men and women of God, your time has come.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:50.500]   My friends, will you join me and be part of this new breed?
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.780]   I'd like you just to close your eyes now.
[00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.100]   I want to give you a blessing.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:06.620]   If you feel comfortable wherever you are, just hold your hands out in front of you.
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:14.940]   The blessing is this, may the love of God sustain us in our working.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:20.500]   May the light of Jesus radiate our thinking and speaking.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:26.980]   May the power of the spirit penetrate all our deliberating.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:37.420]   And may all that is done witness to your presence in our lives.
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.020]   Amen.
