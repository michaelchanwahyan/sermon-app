1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 Thank you, Pastor Johnny.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,360
 Good evening, everyone.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,720
 It's so great to be able to worship God with you.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,400
 And today I'll be speaking on the topic, belief.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,680
 Now you know, one of the hardest things sometimes is to have faith.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,920
 I mean, it's easy to have faith when everything is smooth sailing, but it's so much harder

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,600
 when things go south and things are rough.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:39,280
 And how can we still believe when our circumstances or situation seems to be crumbling down?

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,000
 And this is what we're going to be talking about tonight.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,760
 Because usually at that time, what will we feel?

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:53,400
 We'll feel anxious, worried, or we're not quite sure actually how to pray at that time.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,800
 So should we pray optimistically, but then at the same time, we might get disappointed.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,000
 Now how many people have experienced that?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,480
 Can you put it in the chat box if you have experienced a hard time having faith in God

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,280
 when the circumstances are against you?

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,480
 If you do, you can just say yes in the chat box.

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,800
 All right, we've got one.

18
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,480
 And two, maybe a few more.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,480
 Yes, often someone says.

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,920
 Yes, yes.

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,400
 So yes, and that's the thing.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:40,720
 It just seems like the truth be told, sometimes it is easier to believe and depend on God

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,480
 than other times.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,400
 And no, I'm not talking about like not believing that God has sent Jesus to die on the cross

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,200
 for us and to die for our sins and resurrect.

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,280
 We're not talking about that.

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:59,280
 But it's the kind of faith where we can continue to depend on him and trust him in all of our

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,560
 circumstances.

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,680
 Now maybe you might be anxious about which school you should go to, which job you should

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:13,080
 take, or maybe you're worried about your finances and not having enough to go by for another

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,680
 few months.

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,480
 Or you might be anxious about whether or not you ever find yourself a wife or husband or

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,800
 be able to have children.

34
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,600
 And some of us might be worried about going old and having to be by ourselves.

35
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,960
 And I mean, I could just go on and on.

36
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,840
 But our faith in God seems to shrink when God doesn't seem to be acting out as we expect

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,040
 or hope when times are rough.

38
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,040
 And we might lose our peace as well as we constantly think about those problems.

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,680
 So what is it about our problems that make it so scary?

40
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,720
 Is it because it seems to be out of control and impossible to handle?

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,640
 Or is it because the consequences seems to be too unbearable?

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,160
 Well, you see, as we focus on the problem, and the more we look at it, the more scared

43
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,160
 we are.

44
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,000
 But if we look towards someone who can save us, and someone who has that power, then we're

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,760
 going to have faith.

46
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:24,680
 Now one of the imageries that I like a lot is when a baby rests really peacefully in

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,280
 the caretaker's arms.

48
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,420
 And we might even have a few here on screen, but we probably can't put them on.

49
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,800
 And it just looks like this, right?

50
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:41,080
 It almost seems like whatever is happening, COVID, no job, anything, nothing seems to

51
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,600
 be bothered, or the baby doesn't seem to be bothered by it.

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,800
 And today we're actually going to look into the scripture.

53
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,760
 Mark chapter 4, verse 35 to 41.

54
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,680
 And we're very glad because as we are going to listen to the scripture today, we actually

55
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,000
 have a video to go with it.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,680
 And so we're going to play that, and that will be the exact scripture that we need to

57
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,040
 read today.

58
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,120
 That day when evening came, he said to his disciples, "Let us go over to the other side."

59
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,960
 Leaving the crowd behind, they took him along just as he was in the boat.

60
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,760
 There were also other boats with him.

61
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:42,720
 A furious squall came up, and the waves broke over the boat so that it was nearly swamped.

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
 Jesus was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,680
 The disciples woke him and said to him, "Teacher, don't you care if we drown?"

64
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:15,040
 He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the waves, "Quiet, be still."

65
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:23,520
 Then the wind died down, and it was completely calm.

66
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,280
 He said to his disciples, "Why are you so afraid?

67
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,600
 Do you still have no faith?"

68
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,080
 They were terrified and asked each other, "Who is this?"

69
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,360
 Even the wind and the waves obey him.

70
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,640
 So in this account, it might be quite familiar to many of you, because it has been recorded

71
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:58,080
 in three out of the four Gospels, except this time we'll look at it specifically as how

72
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,280
 the Gospel of Mark has recorded it.

73
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,640
 And as you saw, there was a great storm, and the waves were actually breaking the boat.

74
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,200
 The boat was already filled with water, and Jesus was sleeping on the boat.

75
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,120
 Of course, we always wonder, how is it possible that Jesus sleeps like this?

76
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,680
 But that's what is recorded.

77
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,520
 And they went to wake him up, saying, "Teacher, don't you care that we are perishing?"

78
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:33,120
 And this is one of the lines that always fascinates us, because right now, the disciples have

79
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,640
 already been with Jesus for numerous times.

80
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,720
 They've seen him heal the sick and open the eyes of the blind.

81
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,800
 And yet, what we still notice is that they're still calling him what?

82
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,640
 "Teacher."

83
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,920
 And that's actually the very first point that I want to get at, which is, in order for us

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:03,960
 to have that peace in our heart, we actually need to know Jesus as God.

85
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,480
 But they actually only know him as a teacher.

86
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,200
 Now we might wonder, where did this concept of a teacher come from?

87
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:21,760
 Now we look more closely in Mark chapter 1, verse 27, when Jesus first casted out demons,

88
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,560
 they were all amazed.

89
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,520
 And that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this?

90
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,400
 A new teaching with authority?

91
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,120
 He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obeyed him."

92
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,800
 And so they knew that he was a teacher, but this teacher was very different.

93
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,040
 He had authority, even over demons, even over the sick.

94
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,560
 But in this vision was actually quite limited of what Jesus was, because they could only

95
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,200
 see that Jesus was a teacher, and hence, it really limited their faith.

96
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,520
 And it probably looked like this chart below, that their faith was limited because they

97
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,560
 saw him probably more than a teacher, and you can see it in that box, maybe somewhere

98
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,200
 between a teacher and God, but they're not quite sure.

99
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:27,920
 And you know, the more unsure we are of who Jesus is, the more we cannot trust him or

100
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,720
 rely on him, especially during hardships.

101
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,280
 And here we realize that their faith was limited because they didn't really know who Jesus

102
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,120
 was.

103
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,440
 And so this brings us to our first point, and that is, we need to recognize that Jesus

104
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:56,680
 is way more than a teacher, he is God, and that we need to believe that he is God.

105
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,920
 And you see, in this story, it first shows us that it's almost like us, when we first

106
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,120
 hear about Jesus, we might be like the disciples too.

107
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,160
 We might think that he's a great teacher, someone powerful, maybe someone with even

108
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,520
 great philosophy, and maybe even authorities over demons.

109
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:24,200
 But maybe we don't really see him as God.

110
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,840
 And that we can't see him as someone who's able to save us in our situation.

111
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,800
 And so we must begin to tell ourselves the truth from the Bible, that he is God, and

112
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,480
 he is savior.

113
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,440
 And until we recognize that, Jesus will just be a teacher, and our faith will be wavering

114
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,880
 all the time.

115
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:53,200
 And this revelation of Jesus being God will be slowly revealed to the disciples.

116
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,240
 And as he see, as they saw him go up to the cross, they slowly realize who he was.

117
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,720
 And when he resurrected, that's when they really know that he is God.

118
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,360
 And so the same for us, we need to recognize that he is God, so that we can trust him with

119
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,200
 all our problems.

120
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,240
 And the second thing that we notice is that the disciple says, "Do you not care that

121
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,240
 we perish?"

122
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:28,180
 Now, really, the second problem with the disciple is that they questioned if Jesus really cared

123
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,180
 for them.

124
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,120
 Now, if you're with some people, and you don't think that they actually care about

125
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,080
 you, but there's no way you can trust them or to believe them.

126
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,840
 Yeah, sure, they can be all powerful, they can do all these wonderful and great things.

127
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:50,360
 But really, it's got nothing to do with you, because, well, he doesn't care about you.

128
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,520
 So the second thing that we must also believe is that we must believe he cares about us.

129
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,840
 Now, one of the crucial part about having faith in God and a peaceful mind is to know

130
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,440
 how much Jesus deeply cares about you.

131
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,360
 And just like when we have communion just now, it was a remembrance that he loved us

132
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:21,440
 so much that he went on to the cross for us to die for all of our sins.

133
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,240
 And so as the Bible tells us how much he loves us, that's the truth that we need to believe

134
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,960
 in, but not the circumstances that we see.

135
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,280
 But in here, we actually see the disciples' emotions.

136
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,480
 What were their emotions in this verse?

137
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,760
 Well, actually, to me, it seemed like they were more irritated and frustrated and grumbling

138
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,160
 and even blaming Jesus than they were scared.

139
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,080
 So we might think, how come?

140
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:58,560
 Well, I mean, if we think about it, I mean, after all, didn't all their disciples just

141
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,200
 left their home?

142
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:07,520
 They left everything to follow him, but they didn't expect him to be, what, sleeping while

143
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,280
 they were dying and drowning.

144
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,760
 And too often, we too hold the greatest grudges against God.

145
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,280
 When we see that, he has the ability, but he's not helping us in our situation.

146
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,400
 And you know what's even worse?

147
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,720
 It's worse when we think we're a dedicated Christian.

148
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,560
 Like if you have been going to church for many years or if you've been reading the Bible

149
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,840
 or if you're on the worship team, not picking on you guys, worship team, or like a church

150
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:46,160
 staff or even a pastor or attending Bible school, you know, the more we think we have

151
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:56,000
 invested in Jesus and in God and the more delay or it seemed like if Jesus is sleeping

152
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,840
 during your problem, we start to actually be grumbling like the disciples too.

153
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:10,560
 And I just wanted to say as much as we feel these emotions, the fact is the Bible tells

154
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,160
 us that Jesus does care about us because he came for us and he would never forsake us

155
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,400
 and he even gave us eternal life.

156
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,480
 And that's the truth.

157
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:30,800
 And so it's a battle for us to trust God when the situation seems to be really bad.

158
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,400
 And or even the delay of his help, we need to trust him and his words.

159
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,640
 And the fact is the Bible tells us that Jesus cares about us.

160
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:47,440
 It's written all over the Bible in the Old Testament, in the New Testament.

161
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:56,140
 And so much, this cannot just stay as a head knowledge, but it must speak to our heart.

162
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:04,720
 And when we forget, we need to remind ourselves in the midst of our troubles that Jesus cares.

163
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,240
 Now as we read on, we see that Jesus calmed the wind and the sea and actually he turned

164
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,860
 to them and he asked them, why are you afraid?

165
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,160
 Have you still no faith?

166
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,560
 Now the Greek word here for afraid is actually Delos.

167
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,000
 It's a different kind of afraid, it's not really that fear because it's appeared only

168
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,720
 three times in the Bible.

169
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,640
 And this word actually means little faith.

170
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,640
 So he's literally saying, why are you having so little faith?

171
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,640
 Have you got no faith?

172
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,240
 And this is one of the questions where we're going like, Jesus, how come you're asking

173
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
 this question?

174
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,880
 Well, let's see why I have no faith.

175
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,540
 Well, the boat is breaking and we're drowning and dying and you're asking this question.

176
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,400
 It's almost seemed like if it weren't Jesus asking, we'll be a little bit annoyed.

177
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,600
 But we know that Jesus doesn't ask questions without a good reason.

178
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,360
 There's something more that Jesus is asking.

179
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,400
 Now we've already established in the first point that they didn't really see Jesus as

180
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,360
 God, and that's part of the reason why they're having so much trouble in having faith in

181
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
 him.

182
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,240
 But what else is hindering them from having faith?

183
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,360
 Now Jesus could well be asking you the same question.

184
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,520
 How come when you've read the Bible, you believe in God and now we even know he is resurrected,

185
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,840
 so we have more information than the disciples.

186
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:47,240
 But when we are faced with really tough situations, why do you not have faith?

187
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:57,080
 And can you type in the chat box, why is it that we have no faith during that time?

188
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,640
 It's quite a profound question.

189
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,480
 I actually asked myself this and I tried to answer it.

190
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,040
 It's quite hard.

191
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:13,040
 Okay, so far I've seen no answers come in yet.

192
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:23,400
 But what I think that Jesus is trying to get at, oh yes, we underestimate God, good.

193
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,760
 And we overestimate man.

194
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,200
 These are the answers I'm seeing in our chat box.

195
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,560
 And because we only see our circumstances, great.

196
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,600
 No close relationship with God.

197
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,000
 And it's easy to look at our circumstances and forget about Jesus.

198
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,360
 Yes, and these are great answers.

199
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,680
 And I do think so too.

200
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:58,640
 And there is one where I think Jesus is trying to get at, which is for them, they didn't

201
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,240
 have a personal encounter with God.

202
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,040
 And I think somebody here also said no personal relationship with God.

203
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,280
 Now as it is narrated in the later part, they said that they were terrified and they asked

204
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,760
 each other, who is this?

205
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,880
 Even the wind and the waves obey him.

206
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:24,460
 And they were just beginning to have more revelation of who Jesus is.

207
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:34,960
 So this comes to our third point, which is we need to personally encounter God.

208
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,280
 Now think about this, who is this miracle for?

209
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
 Well it was for the disciples.

210
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,160
 And what was the purpose of this miracle?

211
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:52,000
 Because Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee and he was away from the crowd.

212
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,120
 He was only with his disciples and they could have just crossed smoothly across to the other

213
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,480
 side.

214
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,680
 What was the purpose of this miracle?

215
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:10,440
 It was actually to allow the disciples to know who he is through a very personal encounter.

216
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,120
 Now because at the end of the miracle, the disciples had new revelation and they also

217
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,980
 have experienced God and they were no longer seeing him as someone who healed other people.

218
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,040
 He was no longer seeing Jesus as someone who cast out demons for others, but they were

219
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:37,480
 seeing him as the one right before their eyes, able to calm down the wind and the sea and

220
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,620
 the wind and the sea obeyed him.

221
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,700
 He was able to save them.

222
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,420
 So they were able to experience all of that, God's timing and helping them.

223
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:55,900
 It wasn't immediate, but when they called him, he, they, when they called him, he answered

224
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,120
 and they were able to experience his care and his power.

225
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,320
 They were able to be challenged by Jesus right there about their faith.

226
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:12,580
 They were able to come to a personal revelation and this they wouldn't have done if they haven't

227
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,660
 had a personal encounter with God.

228
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,200
 They would have just crossed without anything happening.

229
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,040
 And are we like that too?

230
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
 We've heard about Jesus.

231
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:30,000
 We might have even read a lot about him, but sometimes he might not be a personal God to

232
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 us.

233
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 He is God.

234
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:40,480
 He is good, but he seems to be somewhere far helping others, but not necessarily you.

235
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,820
 And until we have encountered him personally and seen him active in our lives, in our problems,

236
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,960
 he could just stay there being an impersonal God or even just a teacher and our faith would

237
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,220
 be very limited.

238
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:03,020
 Now as his disciples built this deeper relationship with him and got to experience him more, their

239
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,680
 faith grew.

240
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,740
 And until the very end, we actually see in later parts of the new Testament, they had

241
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:17,380
 so much faith that many miracles were performed through them and God used them greatly.

242
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,860
 So this is actually great news for us because if we are like the disciples too, when we

243
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:29,380
 doubted at times of hardship or when we're slow to realize who he is, but we can see

244
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:37,420
 that through many personal relationship and encounter with him, we're actually allowing

245
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:43,580
 God to reveal himself to us and we too can become faithful disciples.

246
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,140
 So we have a lot of hope.

247
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:53,220
 And sometimes we get so bogged down by the situation itself, we miss out on what's the

248
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,020
 most precious thing, which is God himself.

249
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:04,740
 To be able to live life with God, even through the hardships, even to struggle with him or

250
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:12,860
 even be a bit angry with him and then to rely on him and to be challenged by him.

251
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,820
 That is precious.

252
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:25,380
 And so we too need to know him personally and encounter him in order for our faith to

253
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,540
 grow.

254
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:33,780
 Now some months ago, I learned about a little boy and he's around three right now.

255
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:39,020
 And he has been battling with cancer for the last year and a half.

256
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:45,340
 And just a week ago, we found out that he might not be able to make it anytime.

257
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:53,740
 Now the tumor got so big that it was pressing on his urethra and he wasn't able to urinate

258
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,620
 and he was hospitalized the last two weeks.

259
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:03,340
 And I remember just thinking about him and I was starting to tear up and just thinking

260
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:10,340
 about how this three-year-old boy who has to suffer the pain of chemo, not being able

261
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:18,300
 to urinate and this little body, and especially if you've been a parent, to have to go through

262
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,740
 this kind of a sickness in 50% of his life.

263
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,900
 And the suffering is for both him and the parents.

264
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:35,820
 And to our human minds, it begs the question, God, can't you do something?

265
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,140
 Don't you care?

266
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,100
 And the parents are also Christians to have them been praying for him.

267
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:50,620
 And as we got to talk to the dad like two days ago on Thursday, a sister and I were

268
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,640
 able to pray for them.

269
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,320
 And I really wasn't sure how to pray because he was so sick.

270
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,920
 And I had prepared actually two children's books in my backpack.

271
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,880
 One of it that introduced who Jesus was, and another that talked about what heaven is like

272
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,720
 to prepare him for it.

273
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,040
 And I was afraid to pray too optimistically, because then maybe they'll be disappointed

274
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,800
 at the outcome if it's not favorable.

275
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:28,480
 But then a thought came into my mind, and it seemed to ask me, who is it that you believe

276
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
 in?

277
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,080
 And to me, the answer was plain and simple.

278
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,760
 The God of the universe, who has authority on heaven and on earth.

279
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,920
 He who loves us so much that he sent Jesus to die for us.

280
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:53,220
 The one who loves this little one and his family.

281
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,440
 So I knew right there how to pray.

282
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,680
 Not with full assurance of what the outcome would be, but with full assurance of who God

283
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,640
 is.

284
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,280
 And so we started praying for him.

285
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:19,720
 And before we did that, I asked the dad, what would you like Jesus to do for you?

286
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,840
 And he said, he isn't asking for God to necessarily cure him, but he just wanted more time with

287
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,600
 the boy.

288
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,860
 And so I said, that's the direction we'll pray.

289
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,800
 And the gist of the prayer went something like this.

290
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:43,840
 Dear heavenly father, the God of the universe, the one who has authority on heaven and earth,

291
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:51,280
 the one who loves us so much that you gave your son to us, Jesus, you love us and this

292
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,080
 little boy and his family.

293
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,600
 We know that you're listening right here and you're with us.

294
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,400
 And we pray that you will give this boy more time with his family.

295
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,360
 But we'll leave the outcome into your hands.

296
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,960
 In Jesus Christ name we pray.

297
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,320
 Amen.

298
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:18,560
 And as an act of faith, I only gave him the book that introduced who Jesus was.

299
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:25,720
 And I put away this other book, which talked about heaven, and I was planning to refund

300
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,760
 it because I don't think we'll need it.

301
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,800
 As my act of faith.

302
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:38,320
 Now on Friday, we prayed on Thursday and on Friday, just yesterday, we received this message

303
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,600
 from his dad.

304
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,000
 Just want to share with you an update.

305
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,600
 Just want to share an update with all of you.

306
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,600
 The little boy's condition is improving.

307
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,600
 He had a major breakthrough today.

308
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,560
 In a very literal sense, the tumor that was pressing on his urethra for the last two weeks

309
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:13,320
 and made him unable to pee, he is now, sorry, the tumor was pressing on his urethra and

310
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,240
 he was unable to pee for two weeks now.

311
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:23,320
 His diaper last night was soaked with urine, which means the tumor must be shrinking and

312
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,080
 alleviating the pressure.

313
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,160
 Miracles happen and we pray he continues to improve.

314
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,360
 And I just want to say, hallelujah.

315
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,960
 That is our God.

316
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,600
 Can we all give God a big hand?

317
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:46,840
 I don't know where you are, but when I heard that, it was the God I know.

318
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:55,640
 So, my dear friends, miracles happen every day because the miracle worker is well and

319
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,080
 alive.

320
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,000
 He healed the lepers, he opened the eyes of the blind, he calmed the sea, and he still

321
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,600
 does that today because he is God.

322
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,280
 Rather or not, you have faith in Jesus, depends on who he is to you.

323
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,440
 And if you have encountered him personally, you would know this.

324
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,480
 And I encounter him like this all the time.

325
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,040
 So I have a few questions for you.

326
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,080
 Who is Jesus to you?

327
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,920
 And I want to show these options for you to see for yourself.

328
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,440
 Is he a teacher?

329
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,120
 A prophet?

330
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,800
 Someone who might be God?

331
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,920
 Or he is God?

332
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,120
 Who is Jesus to you?

333
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,760
 And you don't have to answer in the chat box.

334
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,760
 Just answer in your heart.

335
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,040
 And the second question I want to ask you is, does he care about you?

336
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,520
 Do you know for sure that he cares about you?

337
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,200
 Is it maybe?

338
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,400
 A little bit?

339
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,760
 Sometimes?

340
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,200
 Always?

341
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,640
 All the time?

342
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,960
 What is it?

343
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,280
 Do you think he cares about you all the time?

344
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,840
 That's another question for you to answer.

345
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:29,760
 And the third question that I want to ask you is, have you invited him into your daily

346
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,480
 life?

347
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
 Maybe a little?

348
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,920
 Sometimes?

349
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,840
 Or depends on what?

350
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,520
 Or always?

351
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,760
 All the time?

352
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,280
 Do you invite him into your daily lives?

353
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,720
 Rather, there are things that you don't care.

354
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,960
 So you're like, all right, I'll leave that to God.

355
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,520
 Or things that you really care.

356
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,800
 Do you invite him into your daily life?

357
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:07,440
 Now, all these questions are for you to answer.

358
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:15,320
 Because how you answer these questions will determine what happens to you.

359
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,040
 And how you encounter our God.

360
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,800
 Are you willing to decide today and firmly tell yourself and the world that Jesus is

361
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:32,440
 God and he loves you and cares for you all the time, anytime?

362
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,800
 And do you let him take care of you and whatever the outcome may be?

363
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,720
 If you're willing, God will give you faith and peace that you've never felt before.

364
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,160
 Now, each time you have a problem, make the choice.

365
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:53,280
 Say no to fear or how bad the situation is.

366
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,600
 Don't zero off on the situation.

367
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,200
 Say yes to him.

368
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,720
 Say yes to his character.

369
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,760
 Say yes, he is God to me.

370
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,040
 He is my God.

371
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,440
 And he loves me.

372
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,040
 And leave the outcome to him.

373
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,720
 And how do we build more faith?

374
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,360
 And what does it look like to invite God into your everyday life?

375
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,280
 Well, if you've been waiting for some time for a spouse, don't focus on the fact that,

376
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,160
 oh, I'm getting older.

377
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:28,040
 And there are very few eligible bachelor or bachelorettes at church.

378
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,240
 No.

379
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,160
 Focus on God's word, his character, and his promises.

380
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,680
 And your prayer can look something like this.

381
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,080
 You are the God of the universe.

382
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,440
 And you have authority over everything.

383
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,160
 You love me and you care about me so, so much.

384
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,920
 Please make me a godly person and give me a godly spouse.

385
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:55,360
 And while you're waiting, upgrade yourself, prepare yourself as an act of faith.

386
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,000
 I mean, there might be a few weird things that you're doing.

387
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,960
 So yeah, try to change that.

388
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,800
 But leave the outcome to God and have peace, whatever it is that he gives you.

389
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,560
 And experience him, struggle with him, cry with him.

390
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,880
 That is precious.

391
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,120
 And while you do that, God will reveal more of himself to you.

392
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:25,520
 And if you've been waiting for years for your sickness to be healed, don't focus on the

393
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,720
 fact that, "Oh, I've tried this, I've done that, I went to this doctor, I don't think

394
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,240
 I'm going to get any better."

395
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,320
 Let's just hope that things don't get worse.

396
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
 No.

397
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,800
 Focus on God's word, his character, his promise.

398
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,400
 And you can pray a prayer like this.

399
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,720
 You are the God of the universe.

400
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,880
 And you have authority over everything.

401
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,320
 You love me and you care for me.

402
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,160
 Please help me know how to eat, which doctor to go to, and take away my sickness.

403
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:04,160
 And while you're waiting, eat healthy, take the medicine you need to as an act of faith,

404
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,960
 and let God have the outcome and have peace.

405
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,440
 Enjoy him in the process.

406
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,640
 And I know if these things sounds like, "Oh, these are too hard.

407
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,760
 These are too big for me."

408
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,560
 Start with the smaller stuff.

409
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,240
 You can pray for God to help you with your project that you're working on, the exam that

410
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,520
 you'll be taking next week, or just trying to catch the minibus that you always miss,

411
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,760
 or with your baking as if it always goes bad, and with your tennis match.

412
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,480
 Now, I'm not sure if both of you are praying at the same time who will win, or maybe one

413
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
 match per person.

414
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,600
 But what I mean is, invite God to be a part of your everyday life.

415
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,280
 Start with the small things and build that trust so that when you're faced with big problems,

416
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,000
 you'll remember, "He has done this for me, and that was how I could also pray because

417
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,200
 I remember he has done so much for me.

418
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,220
 I know I can pray on his character."

419
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:11,880
 And allow him to work every single issue or happy things in your life because he wants

420
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,280
 to be your personal God.

421
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,840
 And that's how we're going to have faith.

422
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,840
 And you know, this is like a snowball effect.

423
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:25,720
 The more you allow him to be in your life, the more you pronounce his goodness and who

424
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,920
 he is, the more faith you have.

425
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,760
 Remember the sister who was praying with me for the dad of the little boy?

426
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:42,120
 After we saw the miracle that happened, she messaged me, and then she told me, "You know

427
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,120
 what?

428
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,680
 Even as impossible as it may seem to our earthly standpoint, I think we have nothing to lose

429
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:56,280
 in terms of being bold in our prayers and praying for full recovery for the boy."

430
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,360
 I don't know what the outcome would be, but you see that?

431
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,560
 That's faith growing.

432
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:07,480
 And I knew right there that both of our faith and all of our faith that has been hearing

433
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,880
 this testimony right now, our faith are growing.

434
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,920
 And at first, we only dare to pray for more time.

435
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:23,560
 But the revelation and the personal encounter of who Jesus is, is giving us more faith to

436
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:30,480
 be more bold, not for the outcome, but for who he is.

437
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,600
 He is our personal God.

438
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,240
 And our prayers would never be the same again.

439
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,200
 And we got to know Jesus more and experience him more.

440
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,920
 And then we have more faith.

441
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,520
 So whatever it is, say no to fear of your problem.

442
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,560
 Are you afraid you won't get into the university you want to go in or get that job you want?

443
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:00,120
 Are you afraid that you may never find the right person to date or get married to?

444
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:05,560
 Are you afraid that your relationship won't get better and it's dwindling off?

445
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,400
 Are you afraid that you won't have children?

446
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,200
 Are you afraid that your children won't get into a good school?

447
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,040
 Are you afraid your depression or sickness won't go away?

448
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,040
 Are you afraid your children will abandon you as you grow older?

449
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:28,600
 There are so many things we can fear, but it's time to say no to all that fear and impossibility.

450
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:36,360
 And it's time to say yes to who Jesus is and that he is God.

451
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,560
 He is your savior.

452
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,120
 It's time to say yes to how much he cares about you and remind yourself of his saving

453
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,120
 grace whenever you doubt.

454
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,760
 And it's time to say yes.

455
00:35:50,760 --> 00:36:01,720
 We want you in every part of our lives because the moments that we spend with God, they're

456
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
 precious.

457
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,720
 They're precious.

458
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:12,360
 Jesus was only on the boat with his closest disciples and he is with us with every situation

459
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,000
 that we're in.

460
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:24,200
 That is precious and our faith will continue to grow deeper.

461
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,800
 So let him into your life.

462
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:35,760
 Invite the way maker, the miracle worker, the promise keeper into your life.

463
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:43,560
 Enjoy the personal relationship with him anytime, whether you're struggling or not.

464
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:51,360
 And start with the small things if the big ones are too hard and let him grow your faith

465
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:58,840
 because he is here, he's working in our midst and he loves you.

466
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,280
 So believe him.

467
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,080
 Let us pray together.

468
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:12,480
 Dear heavenly father, you are our God, regardless of the situation we're in.

469
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:20,520
 And you are the one who holds the key and authority over demons, over sickness, over

470
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:28,120
 our circumstances, over nature, over everything.

471
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:36,600
 And father, we just pray that we would have faith like this, not on whatever the outcome

472
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:45,120
 would be, but on you alone, your character, your presence, and you are on the boat with

473
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,120
 us.

474
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:54,400
 And I pray father, that all of us in this life that we live in, that we get to encounter

475
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,320
 you every day.

476
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,800
 And if we do that, it's heaven on earth.

477
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:09,400
 Because that place called heaven, it's only called heaven because you're there.

478
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,480
 And if you're here with us today, it's already heaven.

479
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,080
 We thank you for loving us.

480
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
 Help us grow in our faith.

481
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,080
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

482
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,080
 Amen.

483
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,080
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
