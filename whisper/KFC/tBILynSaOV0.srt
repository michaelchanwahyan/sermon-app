1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,800
 This weekend in the Christian calendar is Pentecost.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:19,320
 And tomorrow churches all around the world will be celebrating Pentecost.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,800
 I've got a little admission to make for you.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
 I don't know how you felt about last Sunday's sermon with Joyce.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,680
 It really impacted me.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:36,720
 And I'm sitting at home on Sunday and I tore up my sermon for today.

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,720
 I wrote it again.

8
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,520
 Sandra will tell you.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,520
 And I wanted to change that sermon in the light of firstly her message and secondly

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:50,240
 in the light of Pentecost.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:57,520
 So my sermon title is "Serving Makes a Difference" to which I've added, and I've put it on the

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,360
 screen, "Serving in the Light of Pentecost."

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,120
 Now let me tell you what I'm talking about.

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,560
 Most Christians could not imagine having a year go by without celebrating the holidays

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,020
 of Christmas and Easter.

16
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:26,200
 The church Christian calendar is not complete without the observance of these two events.

17
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,200
 Christmas is the event that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,760
 his ministry.

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:45,560
 Easter celebrates the resurrection of Jesus and God's ultimate victory over sin and death.

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:55,400
 Imagine a year with no Christmas turkey and no Easter eggs.

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:02,960
 Imagine a year with no songs like "O Holy Night" or "Christ the Lord is risen today"

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,000
 or the 2023 version "Friday's good but Sunday's coming."

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:21,240
 However, there is a third holiday, a third observance, a third sacred event central to

24
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,000
 our understanding of what it means to be a Christian and what it means to belong to the

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
 church.

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,440
 Though many Christians do not celebrate this event, and some may never have heard of it

27
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:46,420
 or know little about it, that third event is called Pentecost Sunday.

28
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:53,360
 The third great day in the Christian calendar is rooted in the story of Acts chapter 2 and

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,040
 celebrates the day when the Holy Spirit descended on the apostles who were gathered in a room

30
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,080
 in Jerusalem.

31
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:12,540
 Some people mistakenly believe the observance of Pentecost has meaning only for those Christians

32
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,800
 who call themselves Pentecostals.

33
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,560
 The truth is the history of the Christian church stretches back more than 2,000 years,

34
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:32,920
 while the Pentecostal movement did not emerge in its fullness until the turn of the 20th

35
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,480
 century.

36
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:46,480
 Pentecost Sunday is 1,900 years older than Christians who call themselves Pentecostals.

37
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:54,880
 In other words, observing the day of Pentecost is no more a possession of Pentecostals than

38
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:01,480
 observing baptism is the possession only of those who call themselves Baptists.

39
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:15,000
 However, Pentecost and baptism are gifts that God gave to the whole church, to the whole

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,520
 body of Christ.

41
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:26,160
 Pentecost began as and remains one of the major holidays in the Jewish calendar that

42
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,580
 occurs 50 days after Passover.

43
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,840
 The word Pentecost literally means 50th or 50th day.

44
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,080
 The Jews, Pentecost was the time when they celebrated the first harvest of the agricultural

45
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
 year.

46
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,800
 I guess Americans have Thanksgiving, we Brits have harvest festival.

47
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,680
 It was a time when they gave thanks to God for what the land had produced and for what

48
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,120
 their labor had yielded.

49
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,140
 For Christians, Pentecost marks the birth of the Christian church.

50
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:11,920
 The day when Peter preached and in response to that sermon, there was a harvest of 3,000

51
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,560
 souls converted.

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:26,020
 Before Pentecost, the disciples were hiding from the public for fear that what had happened

53
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,040
 to Jesus might also happen to them.

54
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,940
 But look what happened to the apostles after the Pentecost.

55
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:43,300
 Those frightened men had become suddenly and miraculously equipped and empowered to carry

56
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:51,700
 on the ministry that Jesus had begun in the very city of Jerusalem where Jesus had recently

57
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,660
 been put to death.

58
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:03,180
 Peter, he's one of my favorites, 53 days earlier, 53 days, right?

59
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,860
 Had said about Jesus, I never knew him.

60
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:15,180
 Was the same Peter who preached the very first sermon in Acts 2.

61
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:23,260
 Peter on the day of Pentecost stood before a crowd of the same people he once feared.

62
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,540
 Yet he boldly declared the gospel of Christ.

63
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:35,560
 Peter stood before many of the same people who had shouted, "Crucify him!"

64
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:43,920
 On the day Jesus stood before Pontius Pilate in the city of Jerusalem.

65
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:55,780
 Now Peter declared that the man they ordered to be crucified was in fact the Son of God.

66
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,640
 How did Peter go from being frightened to being fearless?

67
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,180
 How did Peter go from being cowardly to being courageous?

68
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:14,600
 How did Peter go from denying Jesus to defending Jesus before the very same people in the very

69
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,480
 same place?

70
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,240
 Peter did not simply change his mind.

71
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,300
 Peter himself was changed.

72
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,400
 Something happened to Peter and the other apostles.

73
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:42,600
 Pentecost marks the outpouring of the Holy Spirit by which human beings are equipped

74
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,640
 to do the work of God.

75
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,760
 I've put this on the screen.

76
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,620
 We've sung this already tonight.

77
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,920
 The church of Christ was born and the Spirit lit the flame.

78
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,560
 Let's read the account, Acts chapter 2.

79
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,800
 When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place.

80
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,600
 Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind and it filled the entire

81
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,440
 house where they were sitting and divided tongues of fire appeared to them and they

82
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,300
 rested on each one of them.

83
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:24,040
 And they all were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the

84
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,620
 Spirit gave them utterance.

85
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,800
 Now they were dwelling in Jerusalem, Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.

86
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,840
 And at this sound, the multitude came together and they were bewildered because each one

87
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,920
 was hearing them speak in his own language.

88
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:49,800
 And they were amazed and astonished saying, "Aren't these all Galileans?"

89
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,160
 How is it that they hear?

90
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:01,160
 We hear each of us in his own native language.

91
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,080
 Consider these three events this way.

92
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:15,520
 If Christmas marks the birth of Jesus, Pentecost marks the birth of the church.

93
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:23,840
 If Easter marks the day when Jesus was raised from the dead, Pentecost marks the day when

94
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:32,400
 that message about Jesus began to make its way to people and places all over the world,

95
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,840
 even to the Far East Finance Center in Aberdeen.

96
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,920
 When Peter told the gospel message of Jesus Christ for the very first time, people became

97
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,880
 ready, became ready to respond to the call.

98
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,480
 Let's read it.

99
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,240
 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of

100
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,080
 the apostles, "Brothers, what should we do?"

101
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,760
 And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ

102
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,280
 for the forgiveness of your sin, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.

103
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:21,440
 For this promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom

104
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,640
 the Lord our God calls to himself."

105
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,360
 And with many other words, he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, "Save

106
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,360
 yourself from this crooked generation."

107
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:43,720
 So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about 3,000

108
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,720
 souls.

109
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:56,000
 Church, that we have failed to understand or observe this day on the calendar does not

110
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,480
 change the basic truth this day holds for every believer.

111
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,720
 Remember that in Acts chapter 1, verses 6 to 8, Jesus tells the apostles to remain in

112
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,600
 the city of Jerusalem until the power of the Holy Spirit came on them.

113
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:19,200
 He was not sending them out to evangelize on the basis of their life experience or their

114
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,080
 understanding of religious laws and teaching.

115
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:28,140
 He was not suggesting that spending three years in his presence had resulted in them

116
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,920
 being equipped for the work that lay ahead.

117
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,280
 Instead, he told them to wait, wait for the power, wait for the anointing, wait for the

118
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
 Holy Spirit to come upon them.

119
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,320
 And once they had that power, they would be ready to go.

120
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,240
 But until that happened, wait.

121
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,980
 Pentecost Sunday is the day we remember when and how that anointing took place.

122
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,240
 The work of the church in the world as an agent of reconciliation and evangelism had

123
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
 begun.

124
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,800
 I've thought about this.

125
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:18,240
 What do you and I do on Christmas that is central to the story?

126
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,160
 Nothing.

127
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,880
 There is nothing for us to do at Easter except celebrate and give thanks for the work that

128
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,480
 Christ has done on our behalf.

129
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,240
 On Pentecost, however, all of that changes.

130
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:45,240
 You and I are called away from our roles as spectators into the role of central characters

131
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,040
 in God's work of redemption and salvation.

132
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:57,000
 As a result of Pentecost, we do not watch what somebody else is doing for God, but are

133
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,040
 being equipped by the power of the Holy Spirit so that we can become actively involved in

134
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,440
 the work of Christ.

135
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,820
 That's what Pentecost is about.

136
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:17,640
 It's the day that Jesus officially transfers to his disciples the responsibility of continuing

137
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,880
 his work.

138
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,920
 The disciples were no longer spectators.

139
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,480
 The time had come for them to do the work themselves.

140
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,400
 It's one thing to watch while somebody else does all the work.

141
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,580
 There's a few churches like that.

142
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,760
 It's another matter to do the job yourself.

143
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:51,800
 However, that is what God called those disciples to do on the day of Pentecost.

144
00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:01,760
 Now I expect the question you're asking, "What has all this got to do with our focus on serving?"

145
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,480
 It hit me.

146
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,680
 It hit me last week as Joyce was speaking.

147
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:18,600
 Remember, Joyce had admitted preferring her comfortable life, air conditioning.

148
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 I think she mentioned sashimi on a few occasions, right?

149
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,760
 Sashimi.

150
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,160
 She preferred that to serving as a missionary in Africa.

151
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,800
 What made the difference?

152
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,400
 I believe it is the spirit of Pentecost.

153
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,480
 We saw this week, I've put a picture on the screen.

154
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
 Let's have a picture.

155
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
 Bless her.

156
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,680
 I was really taken by this lady, I tell you.

157
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:02,640
 This was a Hong Kong lady by her own admission, a spoiled Hong Kong child, right?

158
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:11,200
 Standing before us, speaking so powerfully by the power of the Holy Spirit.

159
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,800
 We saw this with Susanna five weeks ago.

160
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,480
 We saw this with Mr. Green three weeks ago.

161
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,680
 And we look forward to welcoming Alia from Mother's Choice next week.

162
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:34,240
 I sincerely believe that we as a church are being called to serve the community.

163
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:44,400
 I've said this so many times that I want to see every one of us involved, not just the

164
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,320
 same usual volunteers.

165
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,760
 The truth is, rather like Joyce, we cannot do this in our own strength.

166
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,880
 If we try, we will fail.

167
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,120
 But the good news is that God's Spirit, the same Spirit that was poured out on the disciples

168
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,200
 at Pentecost, will equip us to serve.

169
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:22,160
 Let's just take a closer look at what the Holy Spirit does in us.

170
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,280
 Firstly, the Holy Spirit does an inward work in us.

171
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:36,480
 He is the one who administers justification, regeneration, and gives us new birth in our

172
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,560
 lives.

173
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:44,080
 He is the one who cleanses us within, who comforts us, who bears witness with our spirit

174
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,920
 that we are children of God.

175
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:53,560
 Secondly, the Holy Spirit does an upward work in us.

176
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:01,720
 Jesus says of the Holy Spirit, "He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare

177
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,880
 it to you."

178
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:14,160
 The Holy Spirit is forever pointing us heavenward to glorify Jesus and the Father.

179
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,240
 And thirdly, the Holy Spirit does an outward work in us.

180
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:25,960
 The empowerment that took place on the day of Pentecost resulted in a powerful gospel

181
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:34,220
 witness and 3,000 people from a variety of backgrounds were radically saved.

182
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:45,280
 The gospel went out to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.

183
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,080
 These times in which we live, these are exciting times.

184
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:57,760
 We're another embodiment of the spirit of Pentecost as God is once again pouring out

185
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,620
 his Spirit upon our sons and daughters.

186
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:10,560
 We need to embrace this aspect of the power and purpose of Pentecost.

187
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,680
 And it is that outward work I want to concentrate on just for a few moments.

188
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,200
 Many people have their own versions of what Pentecost is all about, and I'm not going

189
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,120
 into them now, and I'm going to say there's nothing wrong with any of this.

190
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,560
 But can I give you my own definition?

191
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,640
 And it's this.

192
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:40,760
 The power and purpose of Pentecost is demonstrated in a life of serving.

193
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:46,560
 It may surprise you I've come up with that.

194
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:55,200
 The power and purpose of Pentecost is demonstrated in a life of serving.

195
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,920
 I picked a couple of verses from the series that we've been looking at just to repeat

196
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,040
 them to you.

197
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,840
 The first one from Ephesians, "For we are God's masterpiece."

198
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,800
 I picked the New Living Translation because I love that word "masterpiece."

199
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,360
 We are God's masterpiece.

200
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,120
 Other versions say workmanship.

201
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,120
 He has created us anew in Christ Jesus so that we can do the good things he planned

202
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,560
 for us long ago.

203
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:31,560
 And from 1 Peter 4, each of you should use whatever gift you have to serve others as

204
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,800
 faithful stewards of God's grace in its various form.

205
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:49,600
 Peter and Paul combine here to remind us that saved people serve people.

206
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,480
 Saved people serve people.

207
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,440
 You were saved at great cost.

208
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:04,280
 You were saved by the sacrificial blood of Jesus Christ.

209
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:12,480
 You were saved at a great cost for a great purpose.

210
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:21,280
 But it is his life-giving, life-changing spirit, the spirit of Pentecost that empowers us.

211
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:32,720
 And I need to tell you that serving others is a life-changing experience.

212
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,480
 God through his spirit works through us to make a difference in the life of the one being

213
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:46,960
 served while also making a difference in the life of the person doing the serving.

214
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,800
 Serving makes a difference in many ways.

215
00:20:51,800 --> 00:21:01,600
 Number one, serving makes a difference in the life of the one being served.

216
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:09,400
 Remember last week we prayed for the team in Cambodia, the end of service?

217
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:17,120
 We've been getting daily reports from Johnny of how these people, these young people are

218
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,160
 making a difference with the young people in Cambodia and the church out there.

219
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,880
 As I say, Johnny's been updating us every day and yesterday he wrote this.

220
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,880
 I'll give you a spoiler alert, this will excite you.

221
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:41,320
 But today we took a step of faith and at the end of each class we gave students an opportunity

222
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:48,040
 to become friends with Jesus by inviting him into their lives as Lord and Savior.

223
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:54,260
 And almost every student prayed the prayer.

224
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:03,760
 In total, we saw over 300 students pray to ask Jesus into their life.

225
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:15,960
 If that's not worth a round of applause, I don't know what is.

226
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:24,200
 But serving also makes a difference in the life of the one serving.

227
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:32,920
 Pastor Johnny informs me that the major impact of this trip will be in those young people

228
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,920
 themselves.

229
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,120
 The three young people you prayed for a week ago.

230
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,120
 I'll be honest with you, I know churches would have said we only got three signed up for

231
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,040
 it, let's cancel the trip.

232
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,380
 It's not worth a week of Johnny's time.

233
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,640
 You prayed last week.

234
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,560
 Michelle got up here and said, actually, these four people are going on a mission trip, but

235
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,920
 you're all on the mission trip.

236
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,320
 Do you remember that?

237
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:14,100
 Over 300 students prayed to give their life to Jesus Christ.

238
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,920
 Serving makes a difference in the life of one serving.

239
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,960
 I know I've experienced myself.

240
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,520
 My third point is the difference that serving makes is life-changing.

241
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,600
 Let me expand.

242
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,920
 We all want our lives to matter, right?

243
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,120
 I hope you do.

244
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,720
 It's the reason we do the things we do.

245
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:46,480
 We chase our promotions and leadership positions because we want to make a difference.

246
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,760
 We encourage our kids to go to college, get a good job, make lots of money in hopes that

247
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,600
 they do, will also make a difference.

248
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:04,400
 There is nothing wrong with wealth or influence, but those things alone won't change the world.

249
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,120
 And they aren't what we were made for.

250
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,440
 We were made to build the church.

251
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:24,120
 Do you remember in January, to prepare us for serving, we discussed equipping the saints.

252
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
 I'll read it again.

253
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,400
 "And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds, and teachers to

254
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:36,080
 equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ until we

255
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:42,120
 all attain to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood,

256
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,840
 to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."

257
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:57,800
 God made each one of us with unique talents, personalities, unique skill sets.

258
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:04,320
 We get the most joy and make the biggest difference when we use our God-given talents, gifts,

259
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,640
 and abilities to build the church.

260
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640
 Let's read on.

261
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,320
 I love this.

262
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:14,560
 "So that we may no longer be children tossed and thrown by the waves and carried about

263
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,600
 by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.

264
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:26,840
 Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into Him who is the

265
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:34,720
 head into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with

266
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:41,680
 which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds

267
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:47,480
 itself up in love."

268
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,200
 As I close, I want to share eight ways.

269
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,320
 It's a good number in Hong Kong, right?

270
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,600
 Eight ways.

271
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,640
 It could have been seven, but it's eight ways.

272
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,040
 Eight ways that serving makes a difference.

273
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:16,720
 Number one, serving allows us to discover and develop our spiritual gifts.

274
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,400
 1 Corinthians 12 compares the church to the human body.

275
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,000
 Just like our body is made up of many parts serving specific functions, the church is

276
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,440
 made up of people with different skills and abilities.

277
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:43,360
 Alone, these pieces aren't very useful, but together we create something beautiful.

278
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,480
 I need you, you need me, we need each other.

279
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,320
 Serving makes a difference.

280
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,360
 Secondly, serving allows us to experience miracles.

281
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,080
 If you remember a few weeks back, I spoke about John 2.

282
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,200
 Jesus was at a wedding and a couple were running out of wine for its guests.

283
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,720
 He tells the servants to fill several big jars to the brim.

284
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,040
 When they served the water to the guests, it was wine.

285
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,680
 The guests never knew what happened.

286
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,640
 The servants were the one who witnessed the miracle.

287
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,160
 I'll say it again, it's important.

288
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,840
 The servants were the ones who witnessed the miracle.

289
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,400
 The same is true for us when we serve.

290
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,000
 My friends, serving makes a difference.

291
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,120
 Number three, serving allows us to experience the joy and peace that comes from obedience.

292
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,920
 One Peter 4 says, "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others

293
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:51,440
 as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms, so that in all things, God

294
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,720
 may be praised through Jesus Christ."

295
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,440
 Serving is a form of worship.

296
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,800
 Serving is a way to express gratitude for what Jesus has done for us and to share the

297
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:12,000
 love and grace that we've been given.

298
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,160
 Serving makes a difference.

299
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:18,920
 Number four, serving helps us to be more like Jesus.

300
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,680
 We shift the focus off of ourselves and onto others through serving.

301
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,360
 We begin to see others as Jesus sees them.

302
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,640
 And we see Jesus in others.

303
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,960
 Matthew 25 says, "Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of these, the least of my

304
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,760
 brethren, you did it to me."

305
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,440
 Serving makes a difference.

306
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:50,640
 Number five, serving surrounds us with other Christians who can help us follow Jesus.

307
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,680
 When we're working side by side with other people, a bond inevitably forms.

308
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,720
 That was part of God's plan for how the church is supposed to work.

309
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,960
 That's why Hebrews 10 says this, "Spur on, spur one another on towards love and good

310
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,800
 deeds, not giving up meeting together, but encouraging each other."

311
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,200
 Serving makes a difference.

312
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,280
 Number six, serving encourages, sorry, serving increases our faith.

313
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:30,120
 As we move out of our comfort zones, God increases our faith by revealing new potential in ourselves

314
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,160
 and in his church.

315
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:38,480
 When we see what he can do with his power at work with us, we begin to look for doors

316
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,440
 he is opening rather than pushing our ways through the ones he's closed.

317
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:50,360
 Ephesians 3:20 says, "Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all we can

318
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,280
 ask or think, according to the power at work within us."

319
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,840
 Serving makes a difference.

320
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:06,560
 Number seven, serving allows us to experience God's presence in new ways.

321
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,040
 Encouragement and healing go hand in hand.

322
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,920
 As we encourage others and they find healing, we're encouraged.

323
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,160
 It's the reason why so many people go on mission trips.

324
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:25,160
 Can I just say, if you get a chance to go on a mission trip, go!

325
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,040
 It will change you.

326
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:35,880
 People come home feeling that they got more than they gave.

327
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,520
 Serving makes a difference.

328
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,560
 And lastly, serving is good for your soul.

329
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,840
 Studies all over the world have shown that volunteering is so good for the mind and body.

330
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,120
 It can ease symptoms of stress and depression.

331
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,040
 Tapping into our gifts and passions builds self-confidence, energy, and strength.

332
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:06,200
 Serving others can be the best distraction from our own worries.

333
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,600
 Eight times, serving makes a difference.

334
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:21,960
 But we make all sorts of rational explanations not to serve.

335
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,120
 I don't have time.

336
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,600
 I don't know what I would do.

337
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,960
 I don't have any special skills to contribute.

338
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,760
 They don't need me.

339
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,640
 But the reality, and if you only pick one thing from this sermon, this is it.

340
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,800
 The reality is that God doesn't call the equipped.

341
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,320
 He equips the called.

342
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,760
 Can I say that again? That's so important.

343
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,840
 God doesn't call the equipped.

344
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,800
 He equips the called.

345
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:06,480
 God used men and women with similar doubts to change the course of history.

346
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:16,600
 Joyce told us that Gideon, remember, was the weakest man in the weakest clan.

347
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:23,200
 Yet God called him a mighty warrior and used him to defeat the Midianites.

348
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,040
 Moses, he didn't think he was a leader or a speaker.

349
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,760
 He had a stutter.

350
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,360
 But God worked through Moses to bring Israel out of slavery.

351
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,920
 David was the youngest and therefore most significant of all his brothers.

352
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,840
 But God worked through David to defeat a giant and eventually made him a king.

353
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:56,800
 Paul used to kill Christians before he met Jesus.

354
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:06,880
 But he went on to become one of the most highly regarded and prolific writers and church planters in history.

355
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,040
 God doesn't just want to work through you.

356
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,800
 He wants to work in you.

357
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,840
 Let me say it again. God doesn't just want to work through you.

358
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,800
 He wants to work in you.

359
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,720
 Yes, serving makes a difference.

360
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:37,840
 But God calls you.

361
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,960
 Who, me? Yes, you.

362
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,840
 To make yourself available.

363
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,640
 Like Gideon, like Moses, like David and Paul.

364
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:56,520
 Like the disciples on the day of Pentecost to be empowered by his spirit.

365
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:04,560
 Together, we can, as the early disciples discovered, change the world.

366
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,480
 Serving makes a difference.

367
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,840
 Let us on this Pentecost weekend seek his fresh anointing.

368
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:20,840
 Amen. Let's stand as the band comes back.

369
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:44,680
 We're going to sing a very simple chorus in a moment.

370
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,920
 it's one which those who've been brought up,

371
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,640
 maybe in the Anglican church will remember,

372
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,160
 is used at the end of a communion service

373
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,700
 and the words are very simple.

374
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,700
 Fill us up and send us out.

375
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:06,020
 Fill us up and send us out.

376
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:09,200
 Fill us up and send us out, Lord.

377
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,780
 A lot of the church,

378
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,280
 fill us up so I can feel good.

379
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,760
 Fill us up for all sorts of reasons.

380
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,320
 Fill us up, Lord,

381
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,320
 and send us out in the power of your spirit.

382
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,080
 If you're comfortable, just stretch your hands

383
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,480
 in front of you, I'm gonna pray

384
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,880
 and Paul's gonna sing to us.

385
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,960
 (gentle piano music)

386
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:53,520
 Lord, on this special weekend,

387
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,300
 thank you for bringing to our mind

388
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,420
 that we need to be filled

389
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,380
 but that we need to be sent.

390
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,400
 Holy Spirit, we need you.

391
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,240
 We can do nothing without you.

392
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,460
 Fill us afresh, we pray.

393
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:33,300
 And Lord, we pray that you'll commission us,

394
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,580
 that you'll send us to the poor, to the lonely,

395
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,420
 to the desperate, to the widow, to the orphan,

396
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,540
 to the refugee,

397
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:53,980
 to that person in the office who nobody talks to.

398
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:03,260
 Fill us afresh.

399
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:08,540
 We need you.

400
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:11,940
 (gentle piano music)

401
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,500
 Fill us up and send us out.

402
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,360
