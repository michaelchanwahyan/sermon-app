00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,040

今天我們會說Joseph

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,240

The Prince of Egypt

21
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,520
Who's watched Prince of Egypt

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,480
OK

我們一起讀吧

28
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,080
Genesis chapter 37

00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,920
我們一起讀

30
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,400
我們開始讀英文

00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,360
OK, let's read together

32
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,240
1, 2, 3

33
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,080
Joseph, a young man of 17

34
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,680
was tending the flocks with his brothers

35
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,920
Now Israel loved Joseph

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,760
more than any of his other sons

37
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,360
because he had been born to him

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,640
in his old age

39
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,320
現在看到了

40
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,680
and he made an ordinate robe for him

41
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,280
When his brothers saw

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,080
OK, Joseph

43
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,120
Jacob

44
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,640
生了多少個兒子

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,320

46
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,440

47
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,080
Joseph排第幾

48
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,680
知道嗎

49
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,760

50
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,720

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
誰說12

52
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,160
有沒有人有11個兄弟姐妹

53
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,640
有沒有

54
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,360
沒有

55
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,960
以前生了很多兒子

56
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,240
OK

57
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,320
那

58
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,560
Jacob排第11

59
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,680
但他的身分是怎樣

60
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,880
Jacob對他是怎樣

61
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,160
他最喜歡誰

62
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,320
他最喜歡的就是Joseph

63
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,440
我們怎麼知道他最喜歡Joseph

64
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
他給了他甚麼

65
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,360
一個robe

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,840
是嗎

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,040
我們看下一個slide

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,720
他很漂亮的一個robe

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,240
是嗎

70
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,280
彩色的

71
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,080
可能彩色

72
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,840
ordinate

73
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,840
即是很漂亮的一個robe

74
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,840
OK

75
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,880
但

76
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,280
他

77
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,600
他爸爸給了他這麼漂亮的一個robe

78
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,440
他哥哥又怎樣

79
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,200
他哥哥又怎樣

80
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,400
就開始不喜歡他了

81
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,080
是嗎

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,640
之前我們說

83
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,560
They could not speak a kind word to him

84
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,520
Right

85
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,840
They hated him

86
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,040
你們

87
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,920
誰有弟兄姐妹

88
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,720
OK

93
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,920
誰有弟兄姐妹

94
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,600

OK

96
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,520
誰覺得他自己是個favorite

Keep your hands raised

98
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,880
田旺你都沒有

99
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,600
你有嗎

100
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,240

你覺得你是favorite

106
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,080
那你的感受是怎樣

107
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,040
是很開心還是不喜歡還是怎樣

108
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,600
田旺你喜歡還是不喜歡

109
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,160
喜歡

110
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,640
OK

111
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,760
有沒有人不喜歡他是favorite的

112
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,960
OK

113
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,520
誰覺得他自己不是favorite

00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,760
誰覺得自己不是favorite

115
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
沒有人

116
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,720
每個人都覺得自己是favorite

117
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,960
OK

118
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,280
Winnie也是嗎

119
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
No

120
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,440
你覺得

121
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,640
You are not the favorite

122
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,960
為什麼

123
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
我媽媽疼兒子

124
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,720
哦

125
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
媽媽疼兒子

126
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,760
有沒有人好像Auntie Winnie那樣

127
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,360
OK

128
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,040
Bobby

129
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,720
你也是兒子

130
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,840
哦

131
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,800
你媽媽比較喜歡姐姐

132
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,360
哦

133
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,200
OK

134
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,640
但媽媽喜歡你是不是

135
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,960
不知道

136
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,680
OK

137
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,600
你回去問一下

138
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,360
那

139
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,840
這個story呢

140
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,720
Jacob favor了Joseph

141
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,040
後果是什麼

142
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,400
Favoritism causes envy

143
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,360
Favoritism causes envy

144
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
那些哥哥呢

145
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,160
就很討厭Joseph

146
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,800
是不是

147
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,960
Joseph是很high的

148
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,400
是不是

149
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,720
因為

150
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,280
Oh he's the loved one

151
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,960
他最

152
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,000
他爸爸最喜歡他的

153
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,040
但還是很low

154
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,320
因為

155
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,840
他的哥哥

156
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
對他不好

157
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,760
是不是

158
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,200
他對他

159
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,480
不可以說一個好的說話

160
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,960
Can't speak a kind word to him

161
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,040
那這個是我

162
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,960
我

163
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,480
有沒有兄弟姐妹

164
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,120
沒有

165
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,680
沒有兄弟姐妹

166
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,520
Next slide

167
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,200
我只有我自己一個而已

168
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,400
那所以我沒有

169
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,680
我沒有experience這個favoritism

170
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,000
是不是

171
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,680
因為我

172
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,920
我經常都是favorite

173
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,480

174
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,560
好像有些

175
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,520

176
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,920
有沒有single child在這裡

177
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,880
single child

178
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,440
是不是你

179
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,400
You're the favorite

180
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,360
是不是

181
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,760
No choice

182
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,840
No choice

183
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,040
但我剛剛去了一個婚禮

184
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,400
在這個婚禮

185
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,440
她的爸爸

186
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
這個爸爸就說

187
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,160
這個

188
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,280
這個

189
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,360
結婚的妹妹

190
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,520
就是她的favorite

191
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,160
有沒有去過婚禮

192
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,320
知不知道

193
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,920
知不知道誰是我的婚禮

194
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
(亂說話)

195
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,600
亂說話

196
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,440
我不知道

197
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,760
我不知道那個大女兒有什麼感受

198
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,560
有沒有少少envy

199
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,960
不知道

200
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,280
可能那個

201
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,440
那個家庭很loving

202
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,720
It doesn't matter

203
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,440

225
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,160
I had a dream

226
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,840
All of your stacks of wheat

227
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,320
made a circle around mine

228
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,400
and bowed down to it

229
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,920
OK

230
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,000

236
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,520

00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
bowing down to me

248
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
不單止是

249
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,400
那些星星是誰

250
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,080

我告訴你

305
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
我有一次發夢

306
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,640
我發夢我是什麼

307
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,200
我是蜘蛛俠

308
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,240
我是蜘蛛俠

309
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,400
我在New York

310
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,880

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,680
It's in the subway system

317
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
There's a subway attack

318
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,680
Do you know how the terrorist attack

321
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,080
誰知道

用肥皂

324
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,280
They flooded the metro

325
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
with soap

326
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,160
那些soap繼續在升

327
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,240
Rising

328
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,560

那個metro

334
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,680
OK

335
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,600
接著

336
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,400
那些soap

337
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,280
那些肥皂

338
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,400
Keep rising

339
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,200
高

340
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
很高

341
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
接著怎樣

342
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,800
那我就快要掉了

343
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,200
我就快要掉的時候

I'm getting drown by soap

345
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,080
OK

346
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,600
接著

347
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,200
我還沒掉的時候

348
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,000
我就

349
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,880
神啊

350
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,000
幫我

351
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,800
And then I woke up

352
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,000
That was my dream

353
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,920
那如果我告訴你這個夢

354
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,720
你會不會覺得

355
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,120
哇

356
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,720
這個Johnny搞錯

357
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
他以為他自己是蜘蛛俠嗎

358
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
是不是

359
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
是不是

360
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,320
會不會

361
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,720
Maybe

362
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Maybe

363
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,920
可能Joseph

364
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,120
不是想自己宣揚自己的

365
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,920
他覺得

366
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,320
哇

367
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,720
神給了我這個夢

368
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,320
他只是想去分享

369
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,920
神給他的夢

370
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,520
但是這首歌

371
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,920
怎麼看這個夢

372
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,720
這首歌怎麼看這個夢

373
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,320
他看到他們

374
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,320
他看到Joseph

375
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,120
是好像很驕傲

376
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,920
Prideful

377
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
覺得他自己比他們威風

378
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
這首歌

379
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,120
OK

380
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,920
We're gonna skip the verses

381
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,320
We're gonna go

382
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
Self-promotion

383
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,120
causes displeasure

384
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,520
Self-promotion causes displeasure

385
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,520
在這個情況下

386
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,720
Joseph share他的夢

387
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,520
他這首歌就覺得

388
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,720
哇

389
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,320
這個Joseph

390
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
不單是一個favorite

391
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,920
覺得他自己是會做王

392
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,520
會rule over us

393
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,520
你們身邊有沒有人是

394
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,320
很self-promote自己的

395
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,920
哇

396
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,320
這個人很厲害

397
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
這個人很厲害

398
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:22,720
哦

399
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,920
這個人讀書很厲害

400
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
有沒有人是

401
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,720
你覺得有些朋友是很self-promotion的

402
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,520
整天self-promote自己

403
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,520
是吧

454
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,720

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,520

dreams about Jesus

458
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,520
imagine

459
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,120
you don't know the truth your whole life

460
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,920
you've been taught something different

461
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,920
and then you have a dream

462
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
and in this dream

463
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,720
Jesus reveals himself

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,920
as Lord and Savior

465
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,720

Here comes Joseph

474
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,320
the dreamer

475
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
we should kill him now

476
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,520
while we can

477
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,320
繼續

478
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:34,920
繼續

479
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,120
Let's not kill him

480
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,120
we can put him into a well

481
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,720
without hurting him

482
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,520
they attacked him

483
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,720
and tore off his long and beautiful coat

484
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,120
then they threw him into an empty well

485
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,320
that was dry

486
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,120
when the media night

487
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,120
traders came by

488
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,320
the brothers took Joseph out of the well

489
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
and sold him

490
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,320
the traders who brought Joseph down

491
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,320

492
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320

493
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320

494
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,720

495
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Wow

496
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Joseph

497
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,120
被他的哥哥出賣

498
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
有一天

499
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,920
他爸爸說

500
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,720
你去找你哥哥吧

501
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,520
我哥哥不知道去了哪裡

502
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,320
是嗎

503
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:27,920
他們

504
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,120
做什麼

505
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,320
做什麼工作的

506
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,120
他們之前

507
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,320

508
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
(嘆氣)

509
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,120
這哥哥看到他

510
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,320
自己一個

511
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,120
爸爸不在身邊

512
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
他就找這個機會

513
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,520
去出賣他

514
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,720
是嗎

515
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,320
想殺死他

516
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,120
是嗎

517
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,520
他的哥哥

518
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,320
Ruben就說

519
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
不要殺死他

520
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:52,920
是嗎

521
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,320
Give mercy upon him

522
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
不要

523
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,720
不要傷害他

524
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,120
然後他就賣了他

525
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
去埃及

526
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,520
有沒有人去過埃及的

527
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,720
Anybody

528
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,920

533
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
你想一下

534
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,920

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,520

00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,720
有什麼好吃的

540
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,520
爸爸都給他

541
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,920
爸爸

542
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,120

545
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,520
I'm not exactly sure

546
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
但接著是怎樣

547
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,520
是Rock Bottom

548
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,520
被哥哥出賣了

549
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,720
他的衣服又拿了

550
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,520

551
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,720
他被人扔了在一個

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,920
扔了一個Citron

553
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
一個Well

554
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,720
有沒有人見過一個Well

555
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,320

你去過

559
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,320
我想這個Citron

561
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,720
我也不知道

562
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720

563
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,920

已經覺得

664
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:11,920

有一天呢

670
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920

But

677
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,520
I have to give my car to the mechanic

678
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,920
Because he helped me build the car

679
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,520

00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,320

729
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
最後

730
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:09,520

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:09,920

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,920
被人賣了

736
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,920
他去了埃及

737
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,520
去了誰的家

738
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,320
Potiphar

739
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,920
Potiphar

740
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,320
知不知道Potiphar做什麼的

741
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,120
知不知道

742
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,920
有人知道Potiphar做什麼的

743
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,720
He was in charge of

744
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,520
The guards, I think

745
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,120
He was in charge of the Pharaoh's guards

746
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,920
OK

747
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Something like that

748
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,320
那他去到呢

749
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,720
Potiphar的家

750
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,520
然後怎樣

751
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,720
是不是很慘

752
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,120
是不是

753
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,920
好像Cinderella那樣

754
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,320
經常要

755
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,520

756
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,920
是不是很慘

757
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,920

00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
神怎樣

759
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,320
神祝福他

760
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,720
He was the next high

761
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,920
Found favor in Potiphar's eyes

762
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
是不是

763
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,920
Potiphar

764
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,320
看到他

765
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
嘩 這個

766
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,120
Joseph

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
多聰明

768
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:11,920

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,520

OK

774
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,520
He entrusted everything he owned

775
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,920
to his care

776
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,320
因為Joseph

777
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,520

779
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,120
神祝福了整間屋

780
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,920
Potiphar paid no attention

781
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,520
to anything

782
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,720
except the food

783
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,120

809
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,520
那

810
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,520
這個

811
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,920
Potiphar的老婆呢

812
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,720
就看到他

813
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,320
嘩

814
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,920
你

815
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,720
有沒有興趣啊

816
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,120
是不是這樣問的

817
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,920
我不知道

818
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:35,120
有沒有興趣啊

819
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,120
是不是

820
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,920
那他

821
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,120
就想跟他

822
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
He wanted to sleep

823
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,520
She wanted to sleep with him

824
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,320
Right

825
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,920
那Joseph怎樣啊

826
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,720
Joseph說

827
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,720
No啦

828
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,120
是不是啊

829
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,720
No啦

830
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,920
No thank you

831
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,520
是不是

832
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,120
No啦

833
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
為什麼要No呢

834
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,920
He said

835
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,520
Let's go to verse 30

836
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Chapter 39

837
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,320
The next verse

838
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,920
With me in charge

839
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,920
my master does not concern himself with anything in the house

840
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,320
Next slide

841
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,720
No one is greater in this house than I am

842
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,520
My master has withheld nothing from me

843
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
except you

844
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,720
because you are his wife

845
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,520
How then

846
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,920
could I do such a wicked thing

847
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,120
and sin against God

848
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,920
Joseph說

849
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,720
我怎樣可以

850
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,120
對神

851
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
犯罪呢

852
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,720
不單止是得罪Potiphar

853
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,120
我怎樣可以

854
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,520
對神

855
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,920
去犯罪呢

856
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,920
接著怎樣啊

857
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,920
有一天

858
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,320
Potiphar的老婆

859
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
就說

860
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,120
進來吧

861
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,320
進來房間吧

862
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,720
去清潔這個東西吧

863
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,520
是不是

864
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,320
一清潔的時候

865
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,320
他就

866
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,920
你跟我在這裡Lie down吧

867
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,520
是不是

868
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,320
Come come

869
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,120
Lie down

870
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
哈哈哈

871
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,920
接著Joseph怎樣啊

872
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
Joseph就馬上走了

873
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,520
閃

874
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
馬上閃了

875
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,320
是不是

876
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,120
但他留了什麼

877
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
他留了他的

878
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,920
他的cloak

879
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,120
He left his cloak

880
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,720
那麼

881
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,520
老婆就用這個cloak

882
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,920
去accuse他

883
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,520
Potiphar啊

884
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
你這個

885
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
slave

886
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,320
你請回來的這個slave

887
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,120
你看看他想做什麼

888
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,520
是不是

889
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,320
接著他就扔了Joseph

890
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
坐牢了

891
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,920
It's funny like

892
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,120
I just thought of it

893
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,920
Joseph had a beautiful coat

894
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
It was stripped

895
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
And now somebody

896
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,320
tried to take him

897
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,320
and he left his coat

898
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,120
What do you think it means

899
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,320
Interesting

900
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:10,320
OK 我們看到三樣東西

901
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,120
Favoritism leads to

902
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,120
Favoritism leads to

903
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,720
Envy

904
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Right

905
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Self promotion leads to

906
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Displeasure

907
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,320
第三個

908
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
Rejection

909
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
leads to offense

910
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
in the story

911
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,120
Rejection leads to offense

912
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,520
Potiphar's wife wrongfully accuses Joseph

913
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,720
He sets him up

914
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,920
and he is thrown

915
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,320
in jail

916
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,320
很high

917
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
接著又很low

918
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
很high

919
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,920
接著又很low

920
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,120
And when he was thrown into prison

921
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,320
Once again

922
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,720
他坐牢的時候

923
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,520
神又祝福他

924
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,920
神又祝福他

925
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,520
他又

926
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,320
in charge of everything

927
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,720
在prison那裡

928
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
是不是

929
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Warden給他

930
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,120
in charge of everything

931
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,520
神給他有success

932
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,920
他做什麼呢

933
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,720
都有success

934
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,920
God

935
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
blessed

936
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
him

937
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,520
God blessed him

938
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,920
那我們這個story of Joseph

939
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
我們學到什麼呢

940
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,320
What can we learn from the story of Joseph

941
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,320
第一

942
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,120
是faithfulness

943
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,520
Faithfulness 中文是什麼

944
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,720
啊

945
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,320
忠心

946
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,120
對不對

947
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
忠心對不對

948
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,720
loyalty

949
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
啊

950
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
信實

951
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
faithfulness

952
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,120
他對誰

953
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,720
他對誰是faithful

954
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
第一呢

955
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,320
他對他爸爸是faithful

956
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,720
他是faithfully tending the flock

957
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,720
faithfully taking care of the house

958
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,920
他爸爸叫他找他哥

959
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,720
他就去找他哥

960
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,120
He's faithful to his father

961
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
之後呢

962
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
他被人出賣

963
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,920
還有什麼呢

964
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,720
He's faithful to Potiphar

965
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
是不是

966
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,920
他做到

967
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,120
Potiphar

968
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
看到他

969
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,520
哇這麼聰明的這個

970
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,320
我給他

971
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,920
給他所有

972
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,520
所有整間屋

973
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,720
給他in charge

974
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,320
In prison he was also

975
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,520
faithful to the warden

976
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,320
and most importantly

977
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,320
他是faithful to God

978
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,120
faithful to God

979
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,520
是不是

980
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,920
Potiphar's wife

981
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,120
想試探他

982
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
想跟他

983
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
sleep with him

984
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
他認得

985
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,320
神

986
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,920
是最重要的

987
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,120
我不可以

988
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,720
犯罪

989
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,120
Do this wicked thing against God

990
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,920
He was faithful

991
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,720
He was faithful

992
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,520
Because he was faithful

993
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,320
He was blessed

994
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,120
神就祝福他了

995
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
是不是

996
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,520
神祝福他

997
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,720
他有很多low

998
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,120

999
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,920
很多low periods

1000
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,720
被人出賣

1001
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,720
但是神都protect了他

1002
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,520
之前的哥想殺死他

1003
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:28,920
是不是

1004
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
但是怎樣

1005
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,320
他大哥就說

1006
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,720
不要了

1007
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,520
我們就這樣丟他這個Citron

1008
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,320
這個well

1009
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,520
就行了

1010
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
God protected him

1011
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,120
in the most difficult times

1012
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,920
他被人丟了去

1013
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Egypt

1014
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,520
埃及

1015
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,320
神又provide給他

1016
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,520
是不是

1017
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,320
他被人丟了去監獄那裡

1018
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,520
神都繼續去bless他

1019
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
We see God's blessing

1020
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,520
throughout the story of Joseph

1021
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,120
Because he was faithful

1022
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,920
faithful in every situation

1023
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,120
and ultimately faithful to God

1024
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,920
最後第三點

1025
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,120
next slide

1026
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,720
God's plan

1027
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,520
We know that God has a plan

1028
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,920
and later in the story

1029
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,320
We see that Joseph rises

1030
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,120
to become second in command in Egypt

1031
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,320
second in command

1032
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,320
Joseph 有沒有

1033
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
哇 神啊 搞錯啊

1034
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,120
你對我這麼差啊

1035
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,920
他有沒有complain on this story

1036
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,120
Did he complain

1037
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,320
He didn't complain

1038
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,120
Joseph 可以give up的

1039
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
He could give up

1040
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,920
哇 被家人 被哥出賣了

1041
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,120
我不做了 我不跟隨你了

1042
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,120
He could have given up

1043
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,720
He could have complained against God

1044
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,320
But he didn't

1045
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,520
In a way he knew that this dream

1046
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,520
was God speaking to him

1047
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,520
and that God had a plan

1048
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,520
and that God had a plan

1049
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,120
OK 我們現在邀請Kristen上來

1050
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,320
去講見證

1051
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,520
我們給點掌聲她

1052
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:30,720
那我是Kristen

1053
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,720
我今年grade 11

1054
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,920
就是point 5

1055
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,920
我從二年級開始來這個church

1056
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,320
So it's been some time

1057
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,520
Pastor Johnny想我跟大家分享一下

1058
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,920
我怎樣在困難當中去經歷

1059
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,720
其實我是一個比較喜歡自己

1060
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,320
go through things的一個人

1061
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,720
我很少會跟別人分享

1062
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,320
我經歷的困難

1063
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,520
因為我經常覺得

1064
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,520
as long as I do all the best

1065
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,120
我就可以control the end result

1066
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
and achieve到我想achieve的東西

1067
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,120
但是變了我經常很focus on

1068
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,720
我要做的東西

1069
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,920
and to achieve a goal

1070
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,320
變了我很少留一點空間

1071
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,720
讓我自己去rest

1072
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,320
and also to quiet down

1073
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,120
變了sadly我經常忘記了神

1074
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,320
那我可以share一下我的

1075
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,320
我過去的幾個禮拜

1076
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
那for me

1077
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
相信跟大家一樣

1078
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,520
都是比較tough

1079
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,720
and really stressful

1080
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,520
那for me是挺難

1081
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,920
and also sometimes I felt a bit sad

1082
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,320
因為有很多deadline

1083
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,520
and commitment

1084
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,120
and經常夾在兩件事的中間

1085
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,920
and that's a story for another day

1086
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,720
但是

1087
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,120
就是有complication of things

1088
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,320
加起來就變成這樣

1089
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,720
and something that troubles me the most

1090
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
就是thinking about uni

1091
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,320
because you know junior year

1092
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,320
就開始plan for university

1093
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,520
你想讀什麼

1094
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,120
and我的朋友他們全部都是

1095
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
有很大的goals

1096
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,320
and他們想做的東西都是

1097
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,920
挺high achieving的

1098
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,920
那他們就開始說

1099
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,320
他們想做的東西

1100
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,720
他們想take a courses

1101
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,320
and他們的test scores

1102
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,120
有多高and stuff like that

1103
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,520
and compared to me

1104
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,320
他們take a courses

1105
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
are more challenging

1106
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,120
because we are doing different things

1107
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,920
但是

1108
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,520
就是他跟我說的時候

1109
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,320
我可能like

1110
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,720
all my courses are like ok

1111
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,320
所以變了我經常很怕我的courses

1112
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,720
and the things I do

1113
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,720
aren't enough

1114
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,520
and變了我最後做了

1115
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,920
commit myself to a lot of different things

1116
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,720
which 變了我是

1117
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,120
stress myself too much

1118
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,720
然後我經常覺得

1119
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
if I'm not doing enough

1120
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,720
那可能我的application for

1121
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,120
senior year是不夠competitive

1122
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
and

1123
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,920
yeah

1124
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,920
because我take a courses

1125
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,720
跟其他人是不一樣

1126
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,120
yeah

1127
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,520
and 有時

1128
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,720
during the past weeks

1129
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,120
I've been doubted if I'm even fit for

1130
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,520
the course that I want to apply next year

1131
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,920
yeah 我經常覺得

1132
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,520
我做得不夠好

1133
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
and

1134
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,520
那樣東西令我是pretty sad

1135
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,120
因為

1136
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,720
我不知道我還可以做些什麼

1137
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,520
yeah

1138
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
if I go back now

1139
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,720
it's a bit too late

1140
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,520
because everything is pretty much set halfway

1141
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,720
and sadly

1142
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,720
despite all these difficulties

1143
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,120
神是我第一個turn to的人

1144
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,720
and 但是他都沒有忘記我

1145
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,920
he surrounded me with different friends

1146
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,120
他們會經常send me worship songs

1147
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,520
and bible verses給我

1148
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,120
and 我跟他說很多東西

1149
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,320
他們都不會try to

1150
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,720
like solve all the problem

1151
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,520
but instead

1152
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,720
他會send me

1153
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,520
bible verses給我

1154
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,320
and 是挺comforting

1155
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:36,920
and

1156
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
reminded me that

1157
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,720
I'm not going through everything alone

1158
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,520
and 我們更加不是defined

1159
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,120
把我們在人生中所做的事

1160
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,320
或者achieve的事

1161
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
and that

1162
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,720
沒有東西是太

1163
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
沒有東西是太大或太小

1164
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,120
給神去take care of我們

1165
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,120
那

1166
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,520
a few weeks back

1167
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,320
我們有一樣東西在學校

1168
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
那我們就唱了一首song

1169
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,320
一個worship song

1170
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,520
叫做come away

1171
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,720
and 歌詞是挺好的

1172
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,320
it says

1173
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,920
come away with me

1174
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,520
it's never too late

1175
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,920
it's not too late

1176
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,520
I have a plan for you

1177
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,920
it's gonna be wild

1178
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,720
it's gonna be great

1179
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,320
and it's gonna be full of me

1180
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,920
it's really comforting for me

1181
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,520
and

1182
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,720
他是

1183
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,920
reminded我

1184
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,320
that 神是儘管一切的

1185
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,120
and 他永遠都有一個plan for you

1186
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,720
and it's always gonna be best

1187
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
and 他也永遠不會在那裡等你

1188
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,120
to welcome you back

1189
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,520
no matter what happens

1190
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,920
所以當我們去尋求神的時候

1191
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,720
其實會給我們平安和comfort

1192
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,120
and that 他的計劃

1193
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,520
是遠超過我們所想和所求的

1194
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,320
and one thing that I found really helpful

1195
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,720
was to keep a prayer journal

1196
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,320
at that time and time

1197
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,520
你可能不會發覺

1198
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,920
為什麼那件事會發生

1199
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,520
我們也不會明白

1200
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,320
為什麼他會想你去做那件事

1201
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,520
或那件事為什麼會

1202
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,720
like

1203
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
happen

1204
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,320
and

1205
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,120
但是當你回頭去看的時候

1206
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,920
你就會看到

1207
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,520
神他怎樣每一步

1208
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,120
去

1209
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,920
帶領你去

1210
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,520
他想你去的地方

1211
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,920
and 他給你的計劃

1212
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,520
and who he wants you to be and go

1213
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,920
it's not like I have everything figured out

1214
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
因為我們每個人都還在學習

1215
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,720
怎樣去更加的

1216
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,320
依賴神

1217
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,520
and 我希望我今天的分享

1218
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
可以鼓勵大家

1219
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,120
as we go through things together

1220
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,920
and to 經歷神更多

1221
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,720
那麼

1222
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,120
I will end with the Bible verse

1223
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,320
如果你認識我的話

1224
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,120
這個是我

1225
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,920
one of the favorite Bible verses

1226
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
那就是從

1227
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,320
Jeremiah 29:11

1228
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,920
It says

1229
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,120
For I know the plans I have for you

1230
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,320
declares the Lord

1231
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,920
plans to prosper you and not to harm you

1232
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,120
plans to give you a hope and a future

1233
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:47,920
Oh thank you Kristen

1234
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,120
很好的見證

1235
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,320
看到她自己

1236
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,920
經歷到神

1237
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,120
在高低之間

1238
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,920
怎樣去

1239
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,520
繼續去信靠神

1240
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,520
那麼我們to end

1241
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,320
我們有一些application questions

1242
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,120
The first is

1243
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,320
Are we faithful?

1244
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,120
Are we faithful?

1245
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,520
Joseph

1246
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,520
有什麼

1247
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,320
第一

1248
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,520
他是做shepherd

1249
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,720
他是做兒子

1250
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
He was faithful

1251
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,920
He was faithful as a son

1252
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,120
He was faithful

1253
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,320
to the task that he was given

1254
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,920
When he was in Potiphar's house

1255
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,120
he was faithful

1256
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:27,320
to what his master had given him

1257
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,720
When he was in jail

1258
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,520
he was faithful

1259
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,320
Are we

1260
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,520
faithful?

1261
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,720
Are we faithful

1262
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,520
to God

1263
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,120
what He has given us?

1264
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,320
What has God given you?

1265
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,720
And are you faithful?

1266
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,520
What has God given you?

1267
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,920
Maybe it's your studies

1268
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
Maybe it's your career

1269
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,920
Maybe it's the friends that He has given you

1270
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Maybe it's your son or daughter

1271
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,520
Maybe it's

1272
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,920
family

1273
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,120
Are you faithful?

1274
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,920
Are you faithful to Him?

1275
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,120
And are you

1276
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,920
faithful to God ultimately?

1277
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,320
Next is

1278
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,320
Do we want to be blessed?

1279
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,520
Who wants to be blessed here?

1280
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Nobody wants to be blessed?

1281
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,920
Who wants to be blessed?

1282
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,320
How do you become blessed by God?

1283
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,720
Joseph, how?

1284
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
He has success in everything he does

1285
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,120
How can we be like this?

1286
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:37,920
How can we have the same blessing that Joseph has?

1287
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Can we?

1288
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,720
Is it possible?

1289
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,920
Can we?

1290
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,520
Is it possible?

1291
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,720
Who thinks it's possible?

1292
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,520
Raise your hand

1293
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,320
Ok, no one thinks it's possible?

1294
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,920
Really?

1295
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
Really?

1296
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Really?

1297
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,520
Wow

1298
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:00,320
How do we be blessed by God?

1299
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,120
Psalm 1 says this

1300
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:08,120
He who meditates on the Word of God day and night

1301
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,720
He is like a tree

1302
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,320
planted by streams of water

1303
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,920
which produces its fruit in season

1304
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,120
And whatever he does

1305
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,120
he prospers

1306
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:27,320
Psalm 1 tells us that we need to meditate and focus on the Word of God

1307
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,920
And then whatever we do

1308
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,120
that's God's promise

1309
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,520
that we would prosper

1310
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,720
How can we be blessed by God?

1311
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,520
The key is this

1312
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,920
to put him first

1313
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,520
In your studies

1314
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,720
put him first

1315
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,920
You want God to bless you in your studies

1316
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,920
put him first

1317
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,720
Trust in God to help you

1318
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,520
put him first

1319
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,720
You want God to bless your finances

1320
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,920
put him first

1321
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,120
Give him a portion of what you have first

1322
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,720
You want God to bless your relationships

1323
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,320
put him first in your relationship

1324
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,320
put him first

1325
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,720
And you will be blessed by God

1326
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,120
The blessing might not be what you expect

1327
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:29,120
It will be God's will for you

1328
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,920
And what he believes is best

1329
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,320
And the last thing is this

1330
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,120
Do we trust God's plan?

1331
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,520
我們相不相信

1332
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,920
神是他有自己的旨意

1333
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,520
就像Kristen

1334
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,720
她有時候高

1335
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,320
讀書有時候低

1336
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,720
她經歷高低

1337
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,520
你們每個人都經歷高低

1338
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,320
我也一樣

1339
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,920
但我們相信神有計劃嗎?

1340
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,520
之前Kristen讀了一個經文

1341
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,120
Jeremiah

1342
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,120
神有計劃讓我們成功

1343
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:11,120
在艱難的時刻中

1344
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,720
我們可能被背叛

1345
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,520
我們可能被放棄

1346
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,720
我們可能失敗

1347
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,120
我們還是相信神有計劃嗎?

1348
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,720
如果我們相信他

1349
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,320
如果我們遵守他

1350
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,120
如果我們信仰他

1351
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,920
神會帶領我們通過

1352
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,120
我之前分享了一個故事

1353
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,720
是一個弟兄

1354
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,920
應該賣了車給我

1355
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,120
但沒有買

1356
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,920
所以還有另一個故事

1357
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,120
這裡還有另一輛車

1358
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,920
這輛車是什麼車?

1359
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,120
是一輛Lexus IS250F Sport

1360
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,920
這個朋友是台灣人的朋友

1361
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,120
他也是在Waterloo讀書

1362
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,520
他也在Waterloo

1363
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,120
他讀完書

1364
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,120
他畢業後

1365
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,920
他說「Johnny,我回台灣了」

1366
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,520
我不知道我在說什麼

1367
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,320
「我回台灣了」

1368
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,520
「你想要我的車嗎?」

1369
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,320
我問「你想要我的車嗎?」

1370
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,520
「當然,我想要你的車」

1371
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,720
「你會賣給我嗎?」

1372
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,320
他跟我說的時候

1373
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,720
我就想起之前

1374
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,320
有人說要買車給我

1375
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,320
但之後沒有買

1376
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,720
但這次他賣給我了

1377
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,320
12月10日

1378
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:54,320
我會回到多倫多

1379
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
然後我會開我的車

1380
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,720
我會在2月見到你

1381
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,120
當我回來

1382
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,120
這是我告訴你

1383
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,720
我會離開一段時間

1384
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,520
但神仍然會祝福我們

1385
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,320
神接受

1386
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,120
神給

1387
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,920
但仍然

1388
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,520
祝福是神的名字

1389
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,920
我們一起祈禱

1390
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,520
當我們的慈悲團隊上來

1391
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,320
神父,我們感謝您對約瑟的故事

1392
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,120
他經歷了很多高峰

1393
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,720
他經歷了很多低峰

1394
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,320
但在他們所有的中間

1395
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,720
他對您是信仰的

1396
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,520
他對您的所有事都遵守了

1397
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,120
他被祝福了

1398
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,720
我祈求每一個人

1399
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,920
即使在高峰中

1400
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,120
有些高峰可能是很好的

1401
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,120
有些是很低峰

1402
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,920
有些是失敗的

1403
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,720
但我們仍然會相信您

1404
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,720
您會為我們祝福

1405
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,920
因為我們相信您對我們的計劃

1406
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,520
您會指導我們

1407
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,720
走出我們應該走的路

1408
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,720
祝福我們,神父

1409
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,320
我們在名字的名字祈禱
