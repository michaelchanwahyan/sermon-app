1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,820
 I read something this week. When you are down to nothing, God is up to something. When you

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:25,620
 are down to nothing, God is up to something. My last sermon here with a live congregation

3
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:34,980
 was actually the 1st of January. I remember it was a public holiday. I shared a little

4
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:46,260
 of my heart for 2022 with a sermon entitled "A New Thing." I didn't realize how new that

5
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,800
 new thing was to become. On the 1st of January, I don't know if you remember, we had reported

6
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:09,580
 in Hong Kong 18 COVID cases and the 7-day weekly average was just 12. The word "Omicron"

7
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:21,780
 had barely entered our vocabulary. But within a week, church had reverted to live stream

8
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:32,740
 and then Zoom as things got worse. Just as we launched our series on emotional health,

9
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:44,460
 health for all, all for God. By the 3rd of March, daily numbers had reached 76,991. The

10
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:53,800
 weekly average peaked at 66,194 on the 4th of March. That's nearly a half a million cases

11
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:10,340
 in a week. But I believe the biggest danger to our society wasn't COVID. It was fear.

12
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:22,460
 Fear took over our city. And fear led to every one of us suffering from one kind of emotional

13
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:33,660
 distress or another. Yes, every one of us. Fear from families tearing their hair out

14
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:44,940
 with children being "educated" at home, online, while trying to get on with their own lives.

15
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,420
 Fear of possibly being shipped out to quarantine at Penny's Bay and parents being separated

16
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:59,300
 from their young children. Fear of not being able to see relatives overseas due to travel

17
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:08,140
 bans. Fear to people leaving our city to set up permanent homes overseas. My friends in

18
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,260
 the churches UK, bless them, but they were started talking about their churches getting

19
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:23,300
 Hong Kong ready. Fear of catching a disease that was portrayed in the media as far more

20
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:31,420
 serious than it was in reality, especially for younger, healthy, vaccinated people. Now,

21
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:38,740
 just to say, I want to say this, I am not trying to minimise the impact on those who

22
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:50,380
 are sick or those who lost loved ones. We stand with you. But we had no children's playgrounds,

23
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:57,780
 no restaurants for dinners, no cinemas, sports facilities, beauty salons and a variety of

24
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:10,540
 other things, and we had no face-to-face church. I must admit, I found myself getting quite

25
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:20,380
 angry that as a vaxxed person, now quadruple vaxxed, just saying, four times, I could not

26
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:28,180
 fly back for Sandra's sick father's 90th birthday in the UK two weeks ago without a potential

27
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:35,040
 almighty struggle to find flights that would invariably get cancelled and another round

28
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,880
 of quarantine at the end of my trip. We felt so guilty at joining his birthday lunch on

29
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:52,580
 Facebook Messenger. As a church, we found ourselves preaching emotional health, live-streamed

30
00:04:52,580 --> 00:05:01,860
 of course, at a time when emotional health was the one thing that none of us were experiencing.

31
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:11,940
 I believe this series was a godsend. We planned it as early as November. Now, where do we

32
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:22,180
 find ourselves? Well, last week, as you know, we celebrated the reopening of in-person services

33
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:29,580
 after three months of live-streamed Zoom due to the so-called fifth wave in our city. We

34
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,820
 celebrated the lowering of some of the strictest social distancing measures we've had since

35
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,980
 this whole pandemic has begun and the reopening of many important businesses and industries

36
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:50,300
 that in a city that has been painfully hit economically by those strong measures. We've

37
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,020
 also seen the easing of flight bans and the shortening of hotel quarantine times, all

38
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:05,380
 of which are greatly welcomed as the possibility of travel has now increased. Most important

39
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:12,780
 of all, COVID itself seems to be on the decline and cases and deaths seem to be falling on

40
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:21,800
 a daily basis. All of these changes are worth celebrating and all of them are welcome changes

41
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:29,180
 after a very hard few months. But with grateful thanks to my spiritual son, Andrew Gardner

42
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:35,540
 from the Vine Church, I want to offer a word of warning to us. As we stand in these things

43
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:41,380
 that we are celebrating and the joy of being back in person in this room, wasn't it good

44
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,100
 when we went round just to say hi to everybody and not forgetting our wonderful, our wonderful

45
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:58,040
 online audience? You see, as Andrew reminded me, the removal of the problem is not necessarily

46
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:06,780
 the healing. Can I say that again? It's important. The removal of the problem is not necessarily

47
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,780
 the healing. Let me give you an example. If Putin decided a ceasefire today, that would

48
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,880
 be good, but that is not the end of the matter, right? And the removal of social distancing

49
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,040
 measures, the lowering of quarantine, the reduction in cases, the reopening of businesses

50
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,160
 are all wonderful things that we celebrate together, but they do not necessarily equate

51
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,860
 to the emotional healing that we all need. Not just from the past few months, but the

52
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:47,000
 past few years in our city. And my friends, this is a lesson in life. Just because our

53
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,160
 immediate problem seems to be going away, it doesn't mean that suddenly everything's

54
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:05,880
 going to be okay again. In our city, our society, and in ourselves. We've all faced, all of

55
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:13,600
 us have faced incredible hardship, frustration, anger, hurt, pain, worry, anxiety, fear, and

56
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:22,920
 in some cases, genuine trauma over these past few years. And these emotions are not going

57
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:30,360
 to be healed simply by a trip to the cinema, even with popcorn, or a four-person curry

58
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,800
 dinner till 10 o'clock. I want to pick up on Andrew's point, and I'll put it on the

59
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,200
 screen. The experience of our healing and the place of our hope is not found in the

60
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:53,680
 removal of our problem. It is found only in the processing of the trauma caused by the

61
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:04,480
 problem. Now, where does that lead us? I have to tell you, I am possibly the world's worst

62
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:15,680
 golfer. I'm a serial booby prize winner, I've got to say this. But to use a golfing analogy,

63
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:24,480
 our emotional health series has been like hitting the ball off the tee. It can be considered

64
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:32,040
 only as a first shot. Mine were usually in the bunker, but that's another issue. But

65
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:43,880
 my friends, this subject is not going away. This subject is not going away. We need to

66
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:51,520
 look at how we should play our second and subsequent shots as we move closer to the

67
00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:02,760
 flag in the hole. Emotional health is with us long-term. We've never wanted this to be

68
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:13,080
 a flavour of the month series. Emotional health is not about a sermon series, but about a

69
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:21,680
 lifestyle. So what I intend to do today is this. I want to preach a sermon to sum up

70
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,040
 what I believe has been an eye-opening series. By the way, Pastor James preached an incredible

71
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,520
 sermon last week. If you haven't heard it, go home and check it out. And what I want

72
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:44,680
 to also do is to take a look at some next steps, aka the second golfing shot. I've called

73
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:52,960
 this sermon, "Emotional Health in the Light of the Resurrection." I don't know about you,

74
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:01,160
 I loved, I loved the I Am series. And I was so grateful that we ended up two weeks ago

75
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:13,200
 at the empty tomb with I Am the Resurrection. And the reality is, we are all, all of us

76
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:22,680
 in need of a healing that must come from the deep work of the forgiveness of Christ. And

77
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:31,760
 that is only possible because He is the I Am. And most supremely, the one who gave His

78
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:39,840
 life and conquered death by His glorious resurrection. If it were not for the resurrection, I would

79
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:51,000
 not be standing here and my words would be empty. And I want to begin with a question.

80
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,920
 And it's a vitally important question. Why are there so many of us in church, mature

81
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:14,640
 Christians, gifted Christians, emotionally acting like children? I'm serious. We look

82
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:25,080
 like we have it all together. But some of us sometimes cannot admit when we are wrong.

83
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:34,160
 We cannot receive critique. And we are always criticizing others. Or else we are control

84
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:48,280
 freaks. We won't let go. People disappoint us. We get hurt so easily. It leads to whining,

85
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:57,520
 complaining, distancing ourselves from people or just plain sarcastic. I have a name for

86
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:10,960
 it. I need to call it out. It is childish behavior. Childish behavior. But what's the

87
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:18,480
 answer? For our answer, let's turn to scripture, which Bonnie read beautifully for us. Philippians

88
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:27,240
 2, 12 to 13. "Therefore, my beloved, as you've always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence,

89
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,760
 but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For

90
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:41,640
 it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure." And I want

91
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:50,760
 to expound these verses before I start to wrap up our series. Now, why have I chosen

92
00:13:50,760 --> 00:14:02,080
 these verses? Well, we need to see it in the light of Paul, who was writing to encourage

93
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:08,000
 the church in Philippi. This is important. Now, I need to tell you that the Philippian

94
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,640
 church was a healthy church. A church that was doing well. About 18 months ago, didn't

95
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:21,720
 we? We looked at the seven churches in Revelation and they were mostly problematic churches.

96
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,760
 Backsliding, compromising, dead, lukewarm. But by contrast, Paul's letter to the Philippian

97
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:39,600
 church is a letter of encouragement. He's saying this, "Guys, you're doing a good job.

98
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:47,880
 Keep it up." Can I just put an observation here? As the worldwide church, we've got to

99
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:54,240
 be better at encouragement. As a pastor, I've often got used to people telling us what we're

100
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:03,680
 doing wrong. I call them the Monday morning emails. This emotional health series was never

101
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:13,920
 about what we're doing wrong. Paul was saying to the church and to us that they have obeyed

102
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,440
 in the past. He's saying, "Well done, guys." And should continue to work out their salvation

103
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,720
 with trembling and fear. He's saying they cannot be content with past glories. This

104
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,040
 is an important message for the Hong Kong church and for Convoc church. But need to

105
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,960
 demonstrate their faith day by day as they nurture the relationship with a crucified

106
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:57,440
 and resurrected God. And that is the key. Christianity was never about a religion, but

107
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:08,120
 a relationship. And relationships have to be nurtured. Imagine a boyfriend, girlfriend,

108
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,480
 or husband and wife relationship without working to nurture the relationship. You see them,

109
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,680
 don't you? They go out to dinner, the two of them, husband and wife, little dinner.

110
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:23,200
 They're both on their iPhones all evening. You've got to nurture the relationship. Imagine

111
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:29,960
 to try to get fit physically without working out. By the way, if you find the answer, please

112
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:40,600
 tell me. In the same way, our relationship with God grows as we work out, express our

113
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,560
 love and nurture the relationship. But I do want to point out that whilst God's justice

114
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:54,800
 is a cause, a very good cause for sober living, the phrase fear and trembling highlights this.

115
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:02,080
 But rather it is God's love and enabling grace that will see them through. We read, "For

116
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:12,200
 it is God who works in you." So they and we can rejoice in God's empowering presence,

117
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:19,600
 even as they work hard at living responsible lives. While some people would argue that

118
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:29,760
 verse 12 points towards a salvation by works, it is clear from Paul's teaching that he means

119
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:38,080
 no such thing. I mean, do you remember when we spent 38 weeks in Romans? I got fed up

120
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,360
 with saying, "For it is by grace that we have been saved," right? Every week. I believe

121
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:51,480
 that Paul uses the word salvation, not as an alter call and what the church has called

122
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,560
 a sinner's prayer, but in progressively coming to experience all the aspects and blessings

123
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:09,360
 of salvation. The Philippians' continued obedience is an inherent part of working out their salvation

124
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:18,720
 in this sense. But as verse 13 points out, these works are the result of God's work within

125
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:27,400
 his people. As Paul points out, both to will and to work for his good pleasure. Even the

126
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:35,860
 desire within us, we read, "To will." To do what is good, it comes from God. But he actually

127
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:46,760
 works in the believer to generate actual choices of the good so that desires result in actions.

128
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,160
 Paul's perspective is that everything in the world is being renewed and redeemed under

129
00:18:52,160 --> 00:19:01,700
 Jesus' kingship. And Jesus took on the mantle of king when he overcame sin and death on

130
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:11,040
 that first Easter morning as the tomb laid empty and the stone was rolled away. My friends,

131
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:19,160
 we are being matured. We are being perfected by Jesus. That is why Paul encourages us to

132
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:28,560
 continue working out our salvation. But working out our salvation is the responsibility of

133
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:35,520
 believers. I mean, don't get confused here with the forgiveness of sins. You know, we

134
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,600
 sing, don't we, "The vilest offender who truly believes that moment from Jesus, a pardon

135
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:48,560
 received." That's true. But salvation, the wholeness of that word salvation is past,

136
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:59,560
 present, and future. We are saved. We are being saved and will be saved. At conversion,

137
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:07,680
 we receive full forgiveness and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Then life is lived in

138
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:17,040
 the power of the Holy Spirit. Working out our salvation is a partnership. It's God and

139
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:25,200
 us. His part is doing what He is doing in us right now. For we read it, "For it is God

140
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:35,280
 who works in you." God's part is massive. On the other hand, our part is to become like

141
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:45,600
 Jesus. Becoming like Jesus is going to require something from you. Yes, I know it's hard.

142
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,040
 Any of us who've had to fight an addiction will know this. It's hard. Sometimes you feel

143
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:58,320
 like giving up. But there is joy in partnering with the Holy Spirit. And here's the thing,

144
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:10,840
 we do this in community. We will be focusing on this as a church over the months of May

145
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:22,040
 and June in our Church Together series. But for now, let me reiterate and in doing so,

146
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:33,960
 get to my point. Churches tend to focus on spiritual growth. Now, there's nothing wrong

147
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:41,880
 with this at all. Churches will focus on reading our Bible, praying, witnessing, going on mission.

148
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:55,120
 All of these are good things. But churches have by and large ignored emotional growth.

149
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,720
 I've put on the screen Pete Siskiro, the author of the Emotionally Healthy series. He said

150
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,240
 this, "We are created in the whole image of God. We are intellectual, social and emotional

151
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:21,280
 creatures just as God is. Emotions, it follows, are not simply a matter of controlling behaviour,

152
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:27,280
 but they are of spiritual concern." And what I want to do in the next 20 minutes or so

153
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:35,560
 is to recap what we've learnt since the 8th of January and set the scene, as it were,

154
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:43,440
 for going forward for emotional living in the light of the resurrection. And I need

155
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:55,920
 to start by looking at what emotions are. Emotions are important. American psychologist

156
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,880
 Paul Ekman says this, "Emotions change how we see the world and how we interpret the

157
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:11,280
 actions of others." When you see people smiling, you know they're happy. When they're crying,

158
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,360
 you know they're sad. I mean, even Carrie Lam said this when she hosted a press conference

159
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:27,840
 maskless, do you remember? Across cultures, recognisable facial expressions and certain

160
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:36,200
 reactions have become associated with the basic emotions. You pick up these vital cues

161
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:44,280
 from person to person, but do you know what goes into them? A widely accepted theory of

162
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,600
 basic emotions and their expressions suggests that we have six basic emotions. I've put

163
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,520
 them on the screen. They include happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger and surprise.

164
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:03,200
 They often give us an indicator as to the state of our heart. And can I tell you, they

165
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,480
 need to be paid attention to. Most of us that drive cars, we have red lights that go on,

166
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:16,760
 warning lights. And if the red warning light goes on and you ignore it, that's trouble.

167
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,840
 We have these red warning lights that need to be paid attention to. So if I was to ask

168
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,120
 you the question, are you aware of your emotions? What would your answer be? Or is it just too

169
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:35,640
 hard to say? I'm going to suggest this, that we, if we don't do anything else, if this

170
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:48,920
 is all you hear tonight is this, take time, slow down and listen. Ask God to show you

171
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:56,680
 the areas of your need and your areas of strength. Because what we need to get to the bottom

172
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:02,720
 of is this, what is happening below the surface? I spoke on this a couple of months ago. Our

173
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:11,120
 lives are like an iceberg. There is more happening below the surface than what we can see. We

174
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:18,400
 need to start looking beneath the externals. It is the key to understand what areas need

175
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:29,760
 growth and need healing. Now this won't surprise you. I'm an extrovert. My drug of choice is

176
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:42,840
 people. Now it's okay being Jolly John, but the question I need to ask myself is how am

177
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:54,000
 I really, really doing? In between the jokes and the smiles, what is really going on inside?

178
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:11,080
 I need to create times of solitude. I need to sit and then I need to sit and then I need

179
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:22,120
 to sit. Then I need to listen and I need to wait. I do. I need to tell you that waiting

180
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:32,160
 on God is a highlight of my week. But as an extrovert, there is fear there. If I'm really

181
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:40,020
 quiet and listen, I'm afraid of what God's going to say to me. In truth, what I'm fearing

182
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:50,880
 is condemnation, hearing what I'm doing wrong. But when I slowed down and listened, it was

183
00:26:50,880 --> 00:27:03,920
 the opposite. I would hear things like, "You're my son. I love you. John." God doesn't call

184
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:14,440
 me Pastor John. "John, I'm really proud of you." Knowing the depths of God's grace allows

185
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:21,840
 me to be myself. And the most profound thing is this, that you are unconditionally loved

186
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:34,400
 by the Father. In this busy, busy, busy city, may we not be a busy, busy, busy church, but

187
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:45,360
 take time to sit, sit, sit, wait and listen. When we get beneath the surface, the next

188
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:55,760
 thing we have to do is look at the past and break its power. We all have family history,

189
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:06,880
 addictions. We need to say enough is enough. This stops today and break the shackles. Pastor

190
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,240
 Michelle told us this a few weeks ago. This is an ongoing process. Many of us share the

191
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:22,600
 same traits as our parents and even earlier generations. It might be a temper, a negative

192
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:30,120
 attitude or even an addiction. God wants to take you back. It's painful and we try and

193
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:36,580
 fight God. But I believe we have to go back to our past to live more faithfully in our

194
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:45,880
 present. And the good news is we never have to go back alone. We have a loving God and

195
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:58,980
 we have each other. Moving on, and this is a big one for me. We have to know our limits.

196
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:05,440
 When do you say yes and no? I'm speaking to myself here. Sandra will tell you. I'm not

197
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:15,280
 very good at saying no. But a question we need to ask, what has God given me grace for?

198
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,580
 Some of you are in relationships and you've got to ask yourself, has God given me grace

199
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:25,260
 for this relationship? Some of you may need to pull out of relationships if they're not

200
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:31,700
 healthy. And there's some warning signs here. I recognize each one of these like my dashboard

201
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:40,020
 light. Number one, we get anxious. We worry, lack of sleep. Two, we start multitasking.

202
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:47,220
 Three, our mind is racing all the time. Number four, we're not fully present. We're at a

203
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,660
 meeting somewhere and someone's talking to me and we're not fully present. And number

204
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:59,420
 five, we get irritable in normal life situations like when we're in traffic or when we're in

205
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,460
 a queue for a McDonald's and we're in the wrong queue, the other queue's going quicker.

206
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:18,020
 You know what I mean? We get irritable. Take time. Learn the word no. N-O spells no. We

207
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:26,360
 don't talk about Bruno. No, no, no. N-O spells no. Remember the story I told you two weeks

208
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:37,740
 ago about Jesus and Lazarus. Jesus waited. The sister said, "Oh, if only you'd been here."

209
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:43,500
 The reason we are afraid to say no is that we think we have to appear to be strong, to

210
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,820
 have it all together. And to do so, we have to be at everybody's beck and call. But we

211
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:57,740
 live in a different way. We live in a kingdom. And King Jesus will always call imperfect,

212
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:05,900
 broken people to lead and live out of their weakness. Why? Because our vulnerability will

213
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:13,580
 lead people to Him. It's all about Him, not our strength, not our weakness. I love the

214
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:25,220
 next one. It's time to party. Celebrating is a huge part of your emotional health. It's

215
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,220
 been my birthday this week. I've really milked it. I've milked this birthday. I'm even going

216
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,020
 out tonight and tomorrow. I've milked it. And the cream was when Sandra and I went to

217
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,780
 Disney on Monday. And people said, "Where are your grandchildren?" "No grandchildren,

218
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:52,500
 it's just us." All through scripture, we see celebration. Can I be honest here? Some churches

219
00:31:52,500 --> 00:32:03,940
 have forgotten how to have a party. Look at the Bible, the annual Passover, the celebration.

220
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:10,300
 I mean, the wedding at Cana, they ran out of wine. And what did Jesus do, right? He

221
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,660
 turned the water into wine. He wanted them to celebrate. And we've had a lot to celebrate

222
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:25,020
 here recently. But what if someone is having something that we want? You know, they're

223
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,620
 having a marriage, they're having a baby, they got a great job. Are we good at celebrating

224
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:36,860
 with others? And there's a call here, we've got to push through. The key is to celebrate

225
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:44,420
 the little things, make a habit out of it. Celebration will cultivate gratefulness and

226
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:52,900
 thankfulness and leads us to our final heading, incarnational living. James told us all about

227
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:59,300
 it last week. He told us that God became man and moved into our neighbourhood and live

228
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:06,980
 with us. What's our response? We should weep with those who are weeping. We should rejoice

229
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:19,500
 with those who rejoice. That is what our city needs at this time. Our city needs empathy

230
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:27,620
 and not apathy. "Therefore, my beloved, as you've always obeyed, so now not only in my

231
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:33,740
 presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.

232
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:40,060
 For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure." God is

233
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:52,780
 renewing all things under Jesus' kingship and you are an important part of that. As I

234
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:59,820
 finish, what are the next steps? Whilst the Emotional Health series may have finished,

235
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:07,620
 our conversation regarding mental health continues. We have wellbeing champions who are trained

236
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,220
 to listen and refer when it's appropriate. Our motto, I'm going to put it on the screen,

237
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:25,900
 it's OK to not be OK. Contact us on KFCI@GongFuk.org. It will be treated in absolute confidence.

238
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:30,500
 We're planning this spring a gathering of Christian therapists and trained listeners

239
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:36,420
 across Hong Kong who will get together and pray and share thoughts and ideas on how we

240
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:41,700
 can support this initiative. And this fall or autumn, depending on which part of the

241
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:47,060
 Atlantic you come from, we are planning for several groups from around our city to come

242
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:54,100
 together for a one-day mini-conference focused on the critical ties between our faith, mental

243
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:01,580
 health, personal growth, emotional healing and spiritual redemption and transformation.

244
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:17,860
 This is exciting. Watch this space. My friends, you're not alone. We are here for you. And

245
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:27,380
 more importantly, we have a saviour, we have a king. He wasn't just a good man. He wasn't

246
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:37,060
 even just a healer, although he is. He is the one who overcame death. He is risen and

247
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:49,180
 he is alive. His Holy Spirit is here right now. In the light of the resurrection, he

248
00:35:49,180 --> 00:36:01,260
 reminds us when you are down to nothing, God is up to something. Would you stand as we

249
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:27,020
 welcome the worship band back. I want to pray first. We're going to sing this song now,

250
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:35,220
 don't break out, break our walls down. It's really what we need in our hearts and in our

251
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:41,980
 city. I'm going to invite you if you're comfortable and even if you're watching online to just

252
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:58,020
 hold your hands out in front of you as an act of surrender. And we invite you Holy Spirit

253
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,700
 to come and work in our lives, to come and work in our church, to come and work in our

254
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:15,700
 city. I surrender my life to you. I surrender my will to you. I believe you were crucified

255
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:21,660
 for my sins and I believe you resurrected from the dead and that you live by your Holy

256
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:31,180
 Spirit in me. I ask you Lord to do something in me tonight that will enable me when I go

257
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:39,940
 back to my home, when I go back to my work, as I travel on the MTR, that I will carry

258
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:52,380
 your presence. Lord, I would no longer be a victim of emotional health, but I would

259
00:37:52,380 --> 00:38:12,140
 be part of the solution. Here I am Lord, send me. Spirit break out, break our walls down.

260
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:19,820
 Spirit break out, heaven come down. Let's sing this together.

261
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,160
