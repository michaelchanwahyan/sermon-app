1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - Hey, good to see you all.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,660
 Really, really good.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,120
 Hope you've enjoyed a little bit of sunshine,

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:08,960
 managed to get out.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,460
 It's the best time of year in Hong Kong, I believe,

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,620
 in terms of weather,

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:13,900
 in terms of just being able to go out

8
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,020
 and get some fresh air.

9
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,820
 Again, we know that things are still not good,

10
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,700
 but I'm delighted actually to be able to open up

11
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,280
 the Word of God today

12
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,140
 and the passage that Anthony just read to us.

13
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,620
 John chapter eight, verse 12.

14
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,260
 And actually I am going to share screen

15
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,180
 just like Pastor Johnny did last week.

16
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,220
 And hopefully it will work the same for me.

17
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,300
 And of course, this is some new tech that we have here.

18
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,280
 Can you see me floating on the slide?

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,060
 We can, and I'm gonna make myself a little bit bigger.

20
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,380
 I don't look as good as Johnny.

21
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,180
 Seems to have cut a little bit of my hair off,

22
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,140
 but I will make it work.

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,640
 I'm just gonna make myself a little bit bigger,

24
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,940
 just so it's a little bit more overwhelming.

25
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,200
 There we go.

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,040
 How's that?

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,560
 It's good?

28
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,300
 I am the light of the world.

29
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,500
 And it's, you know, what a statement to make.

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,460
 And Jesus spoke to them saying,

31
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,420
 "I am the light of the world.

32
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,860
 Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness,

33
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,900
 but will have the light of life."

34
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,220
 What an audacious statement.

35
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,980
 Now, we've heard this word before.

36
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,900
 If you've grown up in church, you will have heard this.

37
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,900
 You will have sang it.

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,060
 The song that we just sang 10, 15 minutes ago,

39
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,620
 "Light of the world, you step down into darkness."

40
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,900
 So we've heard this word.

41
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,700
 We know what this means.

42
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,680
 Do we?

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
 Do we actually genuinely know what this means?

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,680
 Or actually, do we take it for granted?

45
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,040
 'Cause actually, it's an audacious statement.

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,920
 Can you imagine meeting someone

47
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,880
 and they tell you that they are the light of the world?

48
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,600
 Just to rewind a little bit of context here,

49
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,080
 when Jesus said this,

50
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,720
 he said this just after a major festival

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,280
 in the Jewish tradition.

52
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,120
 And during that time,

53
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,400
 they would have had candles everywhere.

54
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,800
 What do those candles symbolize?

55
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,660
 Those candles would symbolize or represent

56
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,940
 the pillar of fire that the Israelites followed

57
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,100
 during their time in the desert with Moses.

58
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,340
 And it's in that context, with that backdrop,

59
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,020
 Jesus says, "I know you're seeing these candles right here.

60
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,980
 I know you're remembering everything that went on

61
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,420
 with the Israelites back then,

62
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,700
 but I'm telling you, I am the light of the world."

63
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,720
 It sounds poetic.

64
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,620
 It sounds meaningful, we think.

65
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,620
 But then we wonder, actually,

66
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,840
 do he truly understand what it means

67
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,920
 for him to be the light of the world?

68
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,760
 What does it mean?

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,080
 Is it just an abstract concept or is there more?

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,040
 And today I want to unpack what this term really means.

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,040
 And my prayer is that we'll leave this call

72
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,960
 or leave this stream

73
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,640
 and have a slightly better understanding

74
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,240
 of what it means when Jesus says,

75
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,540
 "He is the light of the world."

76
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,600
 'Cause I think there's a more holistic

77
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,640
 understanding of this.

78
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,760
 And there's also a much more specific understanding of this

79
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,640
 that I think we would do well to be able to grasp.

80
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,580
 See, it's interesting.

81
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,740
 He says this, "I'm the light of the world.

82
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,860
 Whoever follows me and will not walk in darkness,

83
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,980
 but will have the light of life."

84
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:07,260
 And then the Pharisees, actually very understandably so,

85
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,180
 then said, "Well, you're bearing witness about yourself.

86
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,620
 Your testimony is not true."

87
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,460
 He's kind of saying,

88
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,540
 "Well, you can't just say this about yourself.

89
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,420
 You can't just make these kinds of statements."

90
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,660
 (speaking in foreign language)

91
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,220
 You can't just say that you're the light of the world

92
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,860
 and we're all going to believe you.

93
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,000
 Why? Why should we even believe you?

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,860
 And then Jesus' response is,

95
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,560
 "Even if I do bear witness about myself,

96
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,680
 my testimony is true,

97
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,800
 for I know where I came from and where I am going.

98
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,120
 But you do not know where I come from or where I'm going."

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,520
 So he's saying here is,

100
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,720
 "Look, I can bear witness about myself

101
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,960
 because I know where I came from

102
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,240
 and I know where I'm going."

103
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,000
 So when I say, "I am the light of the world,"

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,480
 you need to understand that it's got

105
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,480
 a much bigger meaning that he's trying to reveal here.

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,400
 And so today that's what we're going to do.

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,000
 As we look at this term, the light of the world,

108
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,080
 I really feel that there's actually three parts.

109
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,000
 He says, "Look, I bear witness about myself and it's true

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,760
 because I know where I came from

111
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
 and I know where I'm going."

112
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,600
 And so I want to split this into three simple parts here.

113
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,400
 When we understand the light of the world,

114
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,640
 there's really three elements here I want to really unpack.

115
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,400
 That there's almost a past tense.

116
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,840
 There's something about where he came from.

117
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,360
 There's a present tense 'cause he stood there declaring,

118
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,200
 "I am the light of the world.

119
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,400
 Whoever will follow me now will not walk in darkness."

120
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,960
 And then there's a future tense.

121
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,040
 "I know where I came from, but I also know where I'm going."

122
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,680
 So in order to fully understand,

123
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,360
 or at least we only know understand in part right now,

124
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
 but in order to understand more,

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,000
 we need to look into all these elements.

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,040
 And so we'll kick off with the first one

127
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,120
 and that is the past.

128
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,600
 "I am the light of the world."

129
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,400
 You see, when he said that,

130
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,040
 you need to understand the people who are listening,

131
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,040
 they know what light means.

132
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,360
 They haven't, electricity has not been invented yet.

133
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,280
 So when people talk about light,

134
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,280
 it was often used as a common religious description.

135
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
 It was referring to God.

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,360
 See, when we think about the word light,

137
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,120
 we're thinking about the flashlight on our phone.

138
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,680
 We're thinking about the light that we switch on

139
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,000
 when we go into a room.

140
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,080
 But what they think of when they hear light is life.

141
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,360
 The word light and life were very much associated

142
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
 in the very beginning.

143
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,480
 In the beginning, Genesis one,

144
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,920
 God created the heavens and the earth.

145
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,720
 The earth was without form and void

146
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
 and darkness was over the face of the deep.

147
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,320
 And the spirit of God was hovering

148
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,840
 over the face of the waters.

149
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,080
 And then what does he say?

150
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,080
 And God said, "Let there be light."

151
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,160
 And there was light.

152
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
 And God saw that the light was good

153
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,520
 and God separated the light from the darkness.

154
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,320
 So when this world was without form,

155
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,600
 void and dark, there was no life.

156
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,360
 God let us those four words, "Let there be light."

157
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,520
 He creates everything by speaking it into existence.

158
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,880
 Can you see the relationship between light and life here?

159
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,400
 And actually he's saying that he's been here

160
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
 in the beginning, right from the very start.

161
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,160
 When he says he's the light of the world,

162
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,680
 it's not just right now shining onto your life right now.

163
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,400
 He's saying, "I've been there since the beginning."

164
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,320
 In the beginning.

165
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,520
 Where else have we heard those words?

166
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,360
 In the beginning.

167
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,680
 What other part of the Bible have we heard those words?

168
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,240
 They're exactly the same, they mirror it.

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,480
 Of course, it's in the book of John.

170
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,160
 The book of John starts in the same way.

171
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,720
 In the beginning was the word and the word was with God

172
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,560
 and the word was God.

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,040
 He was in the beginning with God.

174
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,200
 All things were made through him

175
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,800
 and without him was not made,

176
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,920
 not anything that was made.

177
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,400
 In him was life and the life was the light of man.

178
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,760
 The light shines in the darkness

179
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,720
 and the darkness has not overcome it.

180
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,200
 So we see here that Jesus is declaring himself

181
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,440
 to be a very big deal.

182
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,200
 He's not just talking about the here and now.

183
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,960
 He's not talking about, "Oh, I light up the room

184
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,600
 because I'm that kind of exuberant extrovert

185
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,040
 that likes to talk to people."

186
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,000
 That's not what he's saying.

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,440
 'Cause he says, "I know where I'm coming from,

188
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,560
 but I know where I'm going.

189
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,640
 I am the light of the world and my witness,

190
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,840
 my testimony about myself is true

191
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,880
 because I've been there since the beginning,

192
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,520
 since the very beginning.

193
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,560
 And you can see me in your story, Israelites,

194
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
 in your history, you can see me."

195
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,440
 I just mentioned this in Exodus 13,

196
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,960
 when they were still wandering, they left Egypt,

197
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,280
 they were wandering in the wilderness

198
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,920
 because they hadn't learned what God wanted them to learn.

199
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,920
 And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud

200
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,360
 to lead them along the way.

201
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,720
 And by night in a pillar of fire to give them light

202
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,680
 that they may travel by day and night.

203
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,640
 Can you imagine just being there in the wilderness

204
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,960
 in the evening, suddenly you'll see, not suddenly,

205
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,400
 you'll just always see this pillar of fire.

206
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,160
 Just understand that for a second,

207
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,840
 but also understand and feel the assurance

208
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,880
 that that would have.

209
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,520
 The one who can create a pillar of fire

210
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,440
 out of nowhere is with you and he is guiding you.

211
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,760
 So we're starting to see the weight,

212
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,800
 we're starting to see the gravity of what Jesus is saying

213
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,360
 when he's saying, "I am the light of the world.

214
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,120
 I can say this is true because I know where I came from.

215
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,200
 I was in the beginning.

216
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,400
 I was the spirit of God, hovering above the waters.

217
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,000
 I was the pillar of fire guiding you."

218
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,240
 Jesus saying, "I represent God's presence.

219
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,760
 I represent God's protection.

220
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,640
 I represent God's guidance.

221
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,600
 I'm a big deal."

222
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,560
 And whilst the Israelites were led through the night,

223
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,280
 we will be led through the darkness as well.

224
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,840
 Jesus here is claiming to be this divine presence

225
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,800
 where he is going to save God's people from bondage.

226
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,880
 He's going to save God's people from darkness.

227
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
 So do we recognize the magnitude of this declaration?

228
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,800
 We have to take it seriously.

229
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,720
 The context of it, the statement demands

230
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,360
 that we take him seriously

231
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,040
 because life is so dependent on light.

232
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,080
 Those of you who know me a little bit,

233
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,280
 I've told what I used to do before,

234
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,800
 but before we came to Hong Kong,

235
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,080
 before we went into full-time ministry,

236
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,160
 I was a biology teacher.

237
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,040
 I taught for seven years

238
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
 in a secondary school teaching biology.

239
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,160
 Not sure how many of you here like biology.

240
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,840
 Actually, I personally really wasn't one of them.

241
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,640
 I probably wasn't that great a teacher either.

242
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,240
 But so one of the things that you learn in biology,

243
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,560
 here's a word that you may not have heard in a long time,

244
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,800
 photosynthesis.

245
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,760
 Does anyone know what photosynthesis means?

246
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,960
 That really interesting topic at school

247
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,040
 where you got to look at plants

248
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,720
 and you got to draw plants.

249
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,200
 Photosynthesis is about,

250
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,840
 plants are primary producers

251
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,960
 and they then basically they absorb sunlight.

252
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,920
 The sun is the source of all energy.

253
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,320
 Actually, we won't be alive were it not for the sun

254
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,240
 because the sun has this light energy

255
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,760
 absorbed by these primary producers, plants,

256
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,560
 and then they're consumed

257
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,480
 and then there are secondary consumers and so forth.

258
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,160
 And then you go the food chain until we're eating all of it.

259
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,840
 That's the magnitude of Jesus' statement here.

260
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,840
 He's saying, "Without me, you won't have life."

261
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,480
 I was there at the beginning

262
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,840
 and without me, you won't have life.

263
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,600
 Now, you've got a choice here.

264
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,720
 There's this guy who's coming out

265
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,440
 with this very audacious statement.

266
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,200
 He says, "You know where he came from

267
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,680
 and what he's saying is true.

268
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,560
 Without him, you won't have life."

269
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,080
 You have a couple of choices here.

270
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,400
 You can, one, decide that he's a lunatic,

271
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,560
 that he's just crazy.

272
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,440
 Okay, fair enough.

273
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,400
 You believe you're the light of the world or whatever.

274
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,440
 Second is he could be a fraud, he could be lying.

275
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,560
 Or the final option is that he really is who he says he is.

276
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,640
 And for those of us on this call,

277
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,160
 I trust many of us here believe that Jesus is saying,

278
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,320
 Jesus actually means what he says and it's true.

279
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,680
 His testimony about himself is true.

280
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,040
 But how often do we truly appreciate that?

281
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,120
 When we actually, so much we treat ourselves as just,

282
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,280
 I'm seeing there are some real geeks in the chat box.

283
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:30,280
 I cannot help myself but just give you a big tick

284
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,200
 and a sticker, sticker for you, Mark and Veronica,

285
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
 for giving us the equation to the 30 sentences.

286
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,840
 Thank you.

287
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,680
 All right.

288
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,120
 We recognize that without him, that we can't live.

289
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
 He's the light of the world.

290
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,400
 Acts 17, 28 says this,

291
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,880
 "For in him, we live and move and have our being."

292
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,240
 He's the center of everything.

293
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,800
 Our lives revolve around him.

294
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,280
 Do we appreciate the magnitude of this statement

295
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,480
 when he says, "I am the light of the world"?

296
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,560
 That's number one.

297
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,640
 That's the past element to this declaration.

298
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,720
 The second is the present,

299
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,480
 because it's not just the fact that he was in the beginning

300
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,920
 before everything was created.

301
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,240
 It wasn't just the fact that he could utter words

302
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
 and creation would happen.

303
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,240
 How many of us would love to just be able

304
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
 to speak things into existence?

305
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,880
 But Jesus could do that.

306
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,600
 But it's not just from before.

307
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,760
 It's not just the pillar of fire and desert.

308
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
 It's also got a present element to it.

309
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,640
 There's a very direct implication for the present as well.

310
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,840
 By declaring he's the light of the world,

311
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,080
 he's also revealing himself.

312
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,320
 You see, what else is light associated with?

313
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,280
 One is associated with life.

314
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:50,120
 The second is associated with sight.

315
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,320
 That we'll be able to see things, right?

316
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,320
 When you walk into a room

317
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,160
 and you can't see anything in the nighttime,

318
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,480
 you switch on the light and then, voila, you can see things.

319
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,520
 It reveals.

320
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,080
 So light then allows us to have sight.

321
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,560
 The Psalmist would say,

322
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,440
 "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path."

323
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,680
 His word and his name is Jesus himself

324
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,160
 is the one who will guide, who will show us how to walk.

325
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,320
 There's an importance in that,

326
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,080
 not only does it give us life from the past till now,

327
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,680
 but it also gives us sight.

328
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,760
 It's revealing right now.

329
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,680
 When you have light, you will be able to see.

330
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,680
 C.S. Lewis has this great quote that says,

331
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,040
 "We believe in God like we believe in the sun."

332
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,800
 Not because we see the sun,

333
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,200
 but because by the sun, we see everything else.

334
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,280
 Because by the sun, we see everything else.

335
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,240
 So when we have the light of the world,

336
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,360
 we get to see everything else.

337
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,200
 We get to see the path that we're supposed to walk down.

338
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,480
 How many of us are currently navigating our lives

339
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,320
 and going, "Which way do I go?

340
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,800
 What do I do?

341
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,640
 Where do I live?

342
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,480
 Where do I work?

343
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,320
 Where do I study?

344
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
 Who should I marry?"

345
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,520
 And Jesus is declaring himself,

346
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,360
 "Hey, follow me.

347
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,960
 I am the way.

348
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,720
 I am the light.

349
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,760
 I will be the one that shines a light down the path

350
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,360
 that you were supposed to take,

351
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,120
 where you are supposed to go."

352
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,800
 But it's actually even more than that.

353
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,160
 When we say that the light of the world

354
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,080
 has a present element,

355
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,920
 it's not just the fact he will show us where to go.

356
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,280
 He's not just a torch.

357
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,080
 He doesn't just reveal the path.

358
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,920
 There is more.

359
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,120
 And in that, finding that,

360
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,640
 we have to rewind a little bit into the context.

361
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,240
 So this verse is chapter eight, verse 12.

362
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,120
 If you just scan up to the beginning of chapter eight,

363
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:39,840
 what prompts Jesus to say this audacious declaration?

364
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,440
 It's a scene that we all know probably very well,

365
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,920
 and it's the woman who's caught in adultery.

366
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,040
 She's caught in adultery.

367
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,400
 And actually, at this point,

368
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,960
 the Pharisees who catch her,

369
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,240
 they have every right to just stone her to death right there

370
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,800
 according to the law.

371
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,920
 She could be gone already.

372
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,080
 Yet, actually, good for her,

373
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,600
 they actually had a bigger fish to fry.

374
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,800
 They didn't want to just stone her.

375
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,000
 They didn't want to just get her.

376
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,360
 They wanted to get Jesus.

377
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,920
 So instead of dealing with her themselves

378
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,520
 and punishing her and killing her,

379
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,040
 they take her to Jesus, hoping to set a trap,

380
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,760
 hoping to get him to expose some of the cracks

381
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,320
 in what he's thinking so they could expose him.

382
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,560
 And so they take him to Jesus and say,

383
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,240
 "Hey, what do you think?"

384
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,720
 And they test him.

385
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
 And then, of course, we all know Jesus then ignores them,

386
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,240
 starts walking, starts writing in the sand,

387
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,760
 and then he says those famous words,

388
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,560
 "Let him who is without sin among you

389
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
 "be the first to throw a stone at her."

390
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,080
 He almost calls their bluff and sets a trap for them.

391
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,840
 And then at that point, one by one, they start to leave.

392
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,600
 And then Jesus stands up and says,

393
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,640
 "Woman, where are they?

394
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,840
 "Has no one condemned you?"

395
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,000
 She said, "No one, Lord."

396
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,480
 Then Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you.

397
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,360
 "Go, and from now on, sin no more."

398
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,560
 And so what can we learn from this passage here,

399
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,320
 where Jesus is confronted with this trap,

400
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,840
 and then he says the words to her,

401
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,760
 "Neither do I condemn you.

402
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,280
 "Go, and from now on, sin no more."

403
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,960
 And it's directly after this passage,

404
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,880
 chapter eight, verse 11, "From now on, sin no more."

405
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,640
 And then verse 12, he jumps into it.

406
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,360
 "Again," Jesus spoke to them and said,

407
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,680
 "I am the light of the world."

408
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,480
 So when we're thinking about Jesus

409
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,320
 being the light of the world,

410
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,760
 it's not just the fact that he gives life.

411
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,680
 It's not just the fact that he reveals sight.

412
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,800
 It's also something to do with how we live.

413
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,120
 The context here tells us it's about our behavior.

414
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,280
 It's about our actions.

415
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,680
 It's not just about the path that we're supposed to go down.

416
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,280
 It's about how we go down it.

417
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,320
 Whoever, 'cause he says, "I'm the light of the world.

418
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,920
 "Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness."

419
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,960
 So this is the second element here

420
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,880
 when we're talking about Jesus being the light of the world

421
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,240
 and the presence is that we cannot walk with him

422
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,120
 and follow him and also still walk in darkness.

423
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,200
 One John says, "God is light,

424
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,960
 "and in him is no darkness at all."

425
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,160
 When there is light, there is not darkness.

426
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,360
 The two cannot coexist.

427
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,800
 They cannot be together.

428
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,840
 Anne Frank, in her diaries from the World War II days,

429
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,520
 said, "Look how a single candle can defy

430
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,120
 "and define darkness."

431
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,840
 So we see, actually, light and darkness can never coexist

432
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,000
 because darkness isn't really a thing.

433
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,800
 Because darkness isn't really a thing.

434
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,200
 We see Einstein, who says, what does he say?

435
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,680
 "Darkness is merely the absence of light."

436
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,240
 So when we have light shine into a room,

437
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,320
 darkness is dispelled,

438
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,160
 but not because darkness is a thing that's been on Earth,

439
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,680
 'cause darkness is nothing.

440
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,400
 Darkness is simply the absence of light.

441
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,200
 And he says, "You can't study darkness.

442
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,440
 "How can you study darkness?

443
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,320
 "To know how dark a certain place is,

444
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,040
 "you simply measure the amount of light in it."

445
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,720
 So we see here that darkness and light cannot coexist.

446
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,360
 So what Jesus is saying here is,

447
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,320
 if you follow me, there cannot be any darkness in your life.

448
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,680
 And there'll be no more need to be afraid

449
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,640
 of the darkness either.

450
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,560
 See, often we're afraid of the dark,

451
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,960
 and children are often afraid of the dark.

452
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,560
 Not really because they're afraid of the dark,

453
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,560
 but just really because they can't see what's there.

454
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,600
 They're afraid what's in the dark

455
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,560
 as opposed to afraid of the dark.

456
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,000
 And so Jesus is saying, "Don't, don't be afraid.

457
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,480
 "I am the light of the world."

458
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,120
 And there's this quote that I'll just simply paraphrase,

459
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,400
 'cause I can't remember exactly where it was,

460
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,760
 but it's, "If you fear God, you'll fear nothing else.

461
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,360
 "But if you don't fear God, you'll fear everything else.

462
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,960
 "If you fear God, you will fear nothing else,

463
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,240
 "because he's the light of the world.

464
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,560
 "But if you don't fear God, you will fear everything else."

465
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,480
 And in order for us to fear God,

466
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,640
 we have to walk and follow him.

467
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,280
 And when we walk and follow him,

468
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,640
 we must not allow any darkness to be in our lives.

469
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,040
 So here's a question I'm gonna turn to you now.

470
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,360
 Is there any darkness in your lives?

471
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,480
 Is there any darkness?

472
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,720
 Is there any crevice of your life, of your heart,

473
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,640
 where actually you have not allowed Jesus into?

474
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,720
 Jesus being the light of the world,

475
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,880
 is desiring to not only give you life,

476
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,240
 is not only desiring to reveal to your path,

477
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,160
 but he's also desiring to cleanse.

478
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,240
 Is there a part of you,

479
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,560
 is there something that you are not willing to let go of?

480
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,200
 Because as children of God,

481
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
 as we follow the light of the world,

482
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,080
 when we follow him, we must not walk in darkness.

483
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,960
 Through this last month,

484
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,840
 I've been just going through the book of Philippians

485
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,560
 and just memorizing it and just trying to meditate on it.

486
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,120
 And this passage in Philippians 2,

487
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,600
 that's just really hit me.

488
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,800
 And it says, "Do all things without grumbling,

489
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,280
 so that you may be blameless and innocent.

490
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,400
 Children of God without blemish

491
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,920
 in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation

492
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,960
 among whom you shine as lights in the world."

493
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,120
 Are we all agreed that we live

494
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,600
 in a crooked and twisted generation right now?

495
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,800
 And yet God is calling us and saying,

496
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,200
 we are children of God without blemish

497
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,560
 in the midst of this crooked and twisted generation

498
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,360
 among whom you shine as lights in the world.

499
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,760
 See, when God shines on you, the darkness is dispelled.

500
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
 You must look different.

501
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,600
 Just before service here,

502
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,720
 I think one of our dear sisters was just talking

503
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,960
 about everything that's happening in this world.

504
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,400
 And she's saying, "For those of us who are believers,

505
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,720
 we must look different.

506
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,560
 We are children of God without blemish

507
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,640
 in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation.

508
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,400
 We have the light of the world.

509
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,640
 We fear God.

510
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
 And because of that, we fear nothing else

511
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,360
 because we know that God is on our side."

512
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,240
 So the question here is this,

513
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,080
 and this one has been convicting me.

514
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,000
 During this time in Hong Kong,

515
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,640
 during this time in the world,

516
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,880
 how different do we look to the next person?

517
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,440
 How different do you look to the next person?

518
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,000
 Are you a child of God without blemish

519
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,160
 in the midst of this crooked and twisted generation?

520
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,560
 Are you shining as a light in the world?

521
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,560
 That's a hard question to ponder on.

522
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,360
 'Cause so often I find whenever I'm meeting people,

523
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,360
 I'm just complaining, I'm complaining, I'm grumbling,

524
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,560
 I'm just frustrated at what's happening.

525
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,760
 I'm feeling hopeless, I'm feeling angry, I'm feeling sad.

526
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,520
 Now, of course, all those emotions are true,

527
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,600
 but yet, and they're right to have.

528
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,080
 But still, there must be something that separates us

529
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,080
 if we have the light of the world in us.

530
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,240
 We must have this difference that shines through us,

531
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,320
 and I'll talk a little bit more about that later.

532
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,360
 So it's not just visually seeing this path now

533
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,680
 because we have the light in the world

534
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,920
 'cause we're following him,

535
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
 but we also have to morally live it out.

536
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,680
 Wouldn't I love just to have a pair of special goggles

537
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,400
 that had a special light that could see exactly where COVID

538
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,000
 and exactly where Omicron was

539
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,880
 and all the surfaces that we're walking around

540
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,320
 and all the people that we meet,

541
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,600
 that we can see just Omicron just waiting to pounce on us.

542
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
 Wouldn't I love to have that light to reveal to us?

543
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,880
 Again, another element of light is UV light

544
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,560
 that's often used to disinfect.

545
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,280
 In some ways, it reminds me that Jesus,

546
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,560
 when he says he wants to shine his light into your life,

547
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,240
 he's also desiring to shine and kill away

548
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
 all the things that are not of him.

549
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,040
 The question is, are there some things

550
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,480
 that we are actually holding onto?

551
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,160
 This light of the world that is revealing and cleansing,

552
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,000
 do we really allow it to shine into every aspect

553
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,920
 of our lives or is there some sin?

554
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,600
 Because if you're a follower of Christ,

555
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,080
 if you are a believer and follower of the light of the world,

556
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
 we will not walk in darkness.

557
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,400
 And I wanna challenge you, brothers and sisters,

558
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,960
 if there's anything that is holding onto you,

559
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,240
 if there is any sin that isn't of God,

560
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,120
 anything that you're tempted to do when you're on your own,

561
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
 giving in to fleshly desires,

562
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,360
 or when you look at someone who has something you want

563
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,880
 and the envy that comes out,

564
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,280
 or when you look at a certain group of people

565
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,200
 or a certain person, you're filled with this anger

566
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,680
 that isn't a righteous anger,

567
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,320
 do you have this in your heart?

568
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,520
 Because if you follow the light of the world,

569
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,680
 you must not walk in that darkness any longer.

570
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,400
 Open yourself up and allow him to create in you a clean,

571
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,000
 a new heart, renew the right spirit in you

572
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,240
 to shine that light into your lives

573
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,240
 because he is the light of the world.

574
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,800
 And finally, so it was the past element,

575
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,920
 there's a present element,

576
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,040
 and finally, there's a future element.

577
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,440
 He says, "What I'm saying is true

578
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,480
 because one, I know where I came from,

579
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,080
 and two, I know where I'm going."

580
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,200
 So there's a future element to this as well.

581
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,360
 So what is that?

582
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,200
 What is he saying?

583
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,720
 What is he thinking about when he's saying,

584
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,880
 "I am the light of the world,

585
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,840
 and there is a future element."

586
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,800
 Imagine being able to know the beginning

587
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,200
 and the end of your story,

588
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,440
 well, not just your story,

589
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,680
 imagine being able to know the beginning

590
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,480
 and the end of this whole story here.

591
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,680
 And that's Jesus' vantage point.

592
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
 And he's saying, "I'm the light of the world,

593
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,840
 and I know where I'm going.

594
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,840
 Where am I going?

595
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,400
 You don't know, but I do,

596
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,960
 but later it's revealed to us."

597
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,080
 And it's in the book of Revelation.

598
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,600
 See, the final couple of chapters in Revelation

599
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,040
 almost seem very similar

600
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:23,400
 to the very first chapters in Genesis.

601
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,520
 There's a new creation that's being created,

602
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,680
 and at the very end here,

603
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
 he's talking about another new creation.

604
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,560
 This is where he's going, Revelation 21.

605
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,880
 "And I saw no temple in the city,

606
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,960
 for its temple is the Lord God,

607
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,360
 the Almighty and the Light.

608
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,560
 And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it,

609
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,280
 for the glory of God gives it light,

610
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,520
 and its lamp is the Lamb.

611
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,040
 By its light will the nations walk,

612
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,440
 and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it,

613
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,280
 and its gates will never be shut by day,

614
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
 and there will be no night there."

615
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,920
 And then in 22, it says this,

616
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,360
 "And night will be no more.

617
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,560
 They will need no light of lamp or sun,

618
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,200
 for the Lord God will be their light,

619
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,160
 and they will reign forever and ever."

620
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,960
 Let's just stop there for a second.

621
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,440
 This new earth, this new heaven,

622
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,880
 that Jesus, again, is gonna speak into existence,

623
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,520
 will have no night.

624
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,920
 There will be no darkness.

625
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,040
 His light will shine across the whole thing.

626
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,440
 Those of us who like sleeping a lot,

627
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,080
 maybe we'll receive that as bad news,

628
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,080
 but I'm sure the Lord will help us in that regard.

629
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,560
 There will be no night there.

630
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,600
 There will be no darkness.

631
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,760
 That's what Jesus is saying

632
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,120
 when he's saying, "I am the light of the world."

633
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,640
 There is gonna be a place

634
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,560
 where I'm gonna transform your lowly body

635
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,560
 to be like my glorious body.

636
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,200
 And you will not need light anymore.

637
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,280
 You will not need your phones to light things anymore,

638
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,360
 because I am the light of the world,

639
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,000
 and I, just like I have powered this whole world

640
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,920
 that you've lived here,

641
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,320
 I will power this new heaven and this new earth.

642
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,280
 So those who embrace the life of Jesus here

643
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,240
 will receive this resurrected life of his,

644
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,360
 where there will be no more pain.

645
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,280
 There will be no more suffering.

646
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
 There will be no more sickness or death.

647
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:10,200
 Travel restrictions will finally be removed.

648
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,560
 He is the light of the world,

649
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,200
 both past, present, and future.

650
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,200
 And then the apostle Paul says,

651
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,640
 "For God who said, 'Let light shine out of darkness,'

652
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,040
 has shone in our hearts

653
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,760
 to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God

654
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,720
 in the face of Jesus Christ."

655
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,840
 The light that we'll need forever and ever

656
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,440
 will emanate from Jesus himself.

657
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,280
 His promise of Jesus will be fulfilled.

658
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,800
 He's promised us that we will never walk

659
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,080
 in darkness anymore.

660
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,600
 Those valleys of the shadow of death will be gone.

661
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,800
 That, brothers and sisters,

662
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,640
 that fact, that future element

663
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,520
 should be all we need to navigate life now.

664
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,160
 When we are filled with hopelessness,

665
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,360
 when we are frustrated,

666
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,040
 when we don't know where the future goes,

667
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,760
 we know someone who does.

668
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,840
 He knows where he came from

669
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,760
 and he knows where he's going.

670
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,800
 And that should light up your life.

671
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,440
 That should give you life.

672
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,040
 That should purify you.

673
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,640
 That should reveal to you what to do next

674
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,160
 because Jesus is the one that is living within us.

675
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,440
 So the question really is, okay,

676
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,880
 there's this abstract big concept.

677
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
 It's holistic and it's specific.

678
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,080
 But what does it mean for us right now?

679
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,720
 Those of us who are living in Hong Kong,

680
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,560
 believers, followers of Christ,

681
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,400
 what does it mean for us?

682
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,120
 Because it's interesting here is

683
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,920
 not only does he say that he is the light of the world,

684
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:50,680
 in Matthew, it also says you are the light of the world.

685
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,880
 Jesus himself, after declaring he is the light of the world,

686
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,280
 then says, actually, you know what followers of me,

687
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,200
 you are the light of the world.

688
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,760
 A city set on a hill cannot be hidden,

689
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,440
 nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket,

690
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,320
 but on a stand and it gives light to all in the house.

691
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,720
 In the same way, let your light shine before others

692
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,040
 so that they may see your good works

693
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,680
 and give glory to your father who is in heaven.

694
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,840
 So whilst Jesus has just declared to them

695
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,640
 and to all of us right now,

696
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,040
 I am the light of the world,

697
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,600
 both past, present and future,

698
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,280
 you also are the light of the world right now.

699
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,400
 You are the light of the world right now.

700
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,720
 You see, we are all agreed that we live in a dark time.

701
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,320
 But yet the question really isn't,

702
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,520
 oh, we're living in a dark time, how can we save ourselves?

703
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,720
 The question is, why has God placed us here?

704
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,840
 The question is, why has God allowed us

705
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:52,120
 for such a time as this to be living here in Hong Kong,

706
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,720
 where it does seemingly seem to be getting darker?

707
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,120
 But then the question isn't, God, what am I doing here?

708
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,760
 The question is, God, are you here and what can I do?

709
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,240
 You are the light of the world.

710
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,240
 And then you've said that I am the light of the world.

711
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,080
 You living in me.

712
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,200
 Now I'm supposed to let my light shine before others

713
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,880
 so they'll see your good works

714
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,000
 and give glory to your father in heaven.

715
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,760
 But we shouldn't be strapped with fear

716
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,920
 going back to that point, we must look different.

717
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,560
 And this is where we as the church need to repent.

718
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,400
 We need to reflect.

719
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,800
 What has God allowed us to do here right now?

720
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,560
 What is he calling us to do?

721
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,920
 When he's telling us that we are the light of the world,

722
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,280
 what does he need us to do?

723
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,920
 Because we must be different.

724
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,920
 Because we are children of God without blemish,

725
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,720
 living in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation

726
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,040
 among whom we shine as lights in the world.

727
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,320
 So let them see our good works

728
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,200
 and give glory to our father in heaven.

729
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,720
 I'll finish with this other passage

730
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,600
 that I've been reflecting on in the book of Mark 4.

731
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,200
 Jesus, after doing some miracles,

732
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,960
 then tells them, "Hey, let's go to the other side.

733
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,800
 Let's go into the lake."

734
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,400
 And then he's setting them up really.

735
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,880
 They go into the boat and they go into the lake.

736
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,920
 He takes a nap.

737
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,760
 And then what happens?

738
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,960
 The storm kicks off and they freak out

739
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,840
 and they don't know what to do.

740
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,880
 And then they go to him and go,

741
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,680
 "Jesus, don't you care about us?

742
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,640
 We're gonna die.

743
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,360
 You're gonna let us die?"

744
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,000
 And then of course he wakes up from his nap

745
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,240
 and then he says, "Peace, be still."

746
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,400
 And he rebukes the wind of waves

747
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
 and it all completely stops.

748
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
 And you know, I was mulling that over

749
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,480
 and recently someone revealed to me

750
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,240
 something that I'd never actually seen before

751
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,120
 in that passage.

752
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
 You can go to if you want to Mark 4,

753
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,480
 that story of Jesus climbing the storm.

754
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,720
 I think it's verse 36.

755
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,160
 I'm looking it up.

756
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
 And it says this.

757
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,000
 And so they get in the boat and they go into the lake.

758
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,680
 And then there's this few words and it says,

759
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,760
 "And there were other boats there also."

760
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,400
 And I just froze when someone revealed that to me.

761
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,240
 I was like,

762
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,040
 man, I'm like the disciples of Jesus

763
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,040
 who were on that boat and freaking out at Jesus.

764
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,600
 Saying, "Why don't you care about us?

765
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,160
 Why aren't you helping us?

766
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,160
 We're gonna die.

767
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,040
 Don't you care?"

768
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,000
 I'm so engrossed in my own thing,

769
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,480
 in my own survival.

770
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,880
 And I neglected to see that actually on that lake,

771
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,680
 there are other boats as well.

772
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:25,120
 Can you imagine the people in those other boats,

773
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,080
 believers, the church, followers of Christ?

774
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,040
 Can you imagine?

775
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,920
 Do you think about the people in those other boats?

776
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,000
 If we were freaking out and we had Jesus in our boat,

777
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,160
 can you imagine what they're going through?

778
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,960
 So here's the thing.

779
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,800
 We have Jesus in our boat.

780
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,320
 We should not be afraid.

781
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,640
 But he's now calling us saying,

782
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,840
 "Hey, look, I am the light of the world

783
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,160
 and you've seen how I live.

784
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,520
 I need you to do the same.

785
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,360
 In the same way, let your light shine before others

786
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,640
 because there are so many out there

787
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,280
 who do not have me in their boat."

788
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,640
 And believers, let our hearts break for that.

789
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,520
 The panic that we feel,

790
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,640
 again, it's not wrong that we feel this anxiety,

791
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,880
 but let us take that to Jesus and say,

792
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,400
 "Jesus, I completely trust in you.

793
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,520
 Help me look different.

794
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,400
 Help me to be your child and in this world

795
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,840
 and still be able to shine your light

796
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,120
 because I know that there are other people out there

797
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,200
 who are really afraid, who don't know you,

798
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,000
 who don't have you in their boats.

799
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,400
 Let us be different."

800
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,400
 And that's the thing that I've been encouraging myself to do

801
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,320
 that I've been encouraging myself.

802
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,200
 What can we do during a time like this?

803
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,960
 My prayer is that any interaction I have,

804
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,600
 any conversation I have,

805
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,400
 any walk I get to go on with someone,

806
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,760
 any lunch I get to meet someone,

807
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,800
 let me be different.

808
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,440
 Let me shine his light.

809
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,240
 Let me not join in in the grumbling.

810
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,640
 Let me not join in in the fear-mongering.

811
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,720
 Let me shine his light

812
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,120
 because I recognize how big a deal that is,

813
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,720
 that he is the light of the world

814
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,680
 in the very beginning and he will be at the very end.

815
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,600
 And we are assured of that reality.

816
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,400
 So let us live now and be in the light of the world here

817
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,720
 in the lives that God has placed us in,

818
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,680
 in this city that he's placed us in.

819
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,320
 Let us be the light of the world

820
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,880
 so that others may see our good works,

821
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,800
 the others may see how we live

822
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:32,120
 and give glory to our Father who is in heaven.

823
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,760
 Because I read this, I saw this online

824
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,240
 and it was just a kind of funny meme

825
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,200
 that really got me thinking.

826
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,160
 It's like, we all keep saying we're in the same boat.

827
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,560
 And the meme was, actually, no,

828
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,680
 we're not all in the same boat.

829
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
 We're all in the same storm,

830
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,360
 but we're all in different boats.

831
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,600
 So have some compassion on people.

832
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,000
 We are all in the same storm,

833
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,600
 but we are not all in the same boat.

834
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
 Jesus is in our boat.

835
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,640
 So let's get our acts together.

836
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,960
 Let's understand who he is and that he can be trusted.

837
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,080
 And let us help those who are in the boats

838
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,720
 where they don't have him in.

839
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,480
 Let the church arise, let the church wake up

840
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,320
 to the fact that we are placed here for a reason.

841
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,600
 And let us not lose heart

842
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,280
 because whilst our outer selves are wasting away,

843
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,560
 our inner selves are being renewed day by day

844
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,160
 by the light of the world.

845
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,640
 So the light momentary afflictions here are nothing

846
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,040
 compared to the eternal weight of the glory that awaits.

847
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,040
 Let us hold that light, however small right now,

848
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,200
 and pray that the spirit would protect our small light

849
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
 and allow it to shine,

850
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,760
 just as those children sing that song.

851
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,360
 Let this light shine.

852
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,200
 Let me pray.

853
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,520
 Jesus, we bow before you.

854
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,360
 You are the light of the world.

855
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:00,160
 It's in you we live and move and have our being.

856
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,280
 You give us life.

857
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,680
 And yet so often we just live just in fear.

858
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,840
 Forgive us, Lord.

859
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,440
 Forgive us 'cause we've forgotten the magnitude

860
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,560
 of who you are.

861
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,520
 Even the wind and the waves,

862
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
 even COVID waves will obey you.

863
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,320
 And yet right now our duty, our job is to forgive.

864
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,200
 Our job is to just turn our eyes to you,

865
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,400
 to put our faith in you.

866
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,360
 And Jesus, we open ourselves up to you.

867
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,120
 If there is any darkness in us,

868
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,640
 will you shine your light into the parts of our hearts

869
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,720
 where you are not and cleanse us from the inside out

870
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,520
 and show us the way to walk now, reveal to us the path.

871
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,280
 And Lord, re-instill a hope in us,

872
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,280
 a faith in us where we keep our eyes on what is to come,

873
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,920
 the future that is to come.

874
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,280
 We may not know what tomorrow holds,

875
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,320
 but we know the one who holds tomorrow.

876
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,920
 We know the one who was there at the very beginning

877
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,600
 and will be there at the very end.

878
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,120
 Fill us with hope, fill us with your light

879
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,160
 and let us not cover our own light, have it hidden.

880
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,160
 Let our light shine.

881
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,160
 (soft music)

882
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,560
