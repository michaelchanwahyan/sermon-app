1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,960
 Alright, well, okay, what do we have here?

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,360
 Well I wanted to make lime soda, okay, but I only found lemon today, so it's lemon soda,

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,880
 okay, and I'm just going to add a little bit of water, a little bit more to it, and there

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,280
 we go, nice cup of mouthwatering, lime soda, lemon soda it is.

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,320
 Now who wants to drink a cup of this?

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,600
 It's not sake, okay, sorry for the confusion.

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:40,000
 Oh, there we go, JP, alright, but there's no drinking here, so afterwards, okay.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,880
 Alright, save one for you, this is for JP, okay, there we go.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,520
 Alright so what I'm going to do is I've brought something, and the reason I needed my mask

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,440
 on is because, well, it's one of a kind kind of thing.

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,720
 Never mind the, I mean, not doing magic up here, so, although it does seem like I am.

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,560
 So look at this, no, it's feces.

13
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:17,120
 Oh, poop, thank you, I love all this response.

14
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,800
 Oh, that's why I have to keep my mask on until later, okay.

15
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,440
 Let me just maybe use this tissue to help me a little bit, alright, don't ask who's

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,440
 is it, doesn't matter.

17
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,560
 Alright, okay, not a lot guys, not a lot.

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,040
 Look at this, this is the McDonald's, it's very little, okay, just a little bit, okay,

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,040
 not too much.

20
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,800
 Alright, just a, okay, I haven't dropped it, I haven't dropped it, I haven't dropped it.

21
00:01:50,800 --> 00:02:00,160
 Oh, alright, alright guys.

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:08,400
 Alright so, now, again, anyone wants a cup of this?

23
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,640
 No, no, no, I've got another.

24
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,440
 Okay I'll save this one for you, JP.

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,480
 Anyone wants, come on, it's just one cup, it's okay.

26
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,600
 No, I'm up in the front row, no, okay, alright.

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,960
 Well this is exactly what, let's go to the next slide.

28
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,880
 So this is exactly what we are going to be talking about tonight.

29
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
 What is it?

30
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,960
 A little folly is dangerous, just a little bit.

31
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,480
 I mean I didn't put a lot in, but all of you are like, no, and I did waste some lime soda,

32
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
 but that's okay.

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,320
 If it gets the point across, it was well spent.

34
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,560
 Okay now I can take my mask off I think.

35
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,600
 Just FYI, it was satay sauce, okay.

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:05,160
 So don't worry, the aroma is still okay up at the stage right now.

37
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:12,420
 Okay so, tonight I really want us to get this one point across, which is a little folly

38
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,800
 can ruin everything, as you've just seen.

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,400
 No matter how much honor or glory that you have, just a little bit of stupidity, a little

40
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:29,160
 bit of foolishness, it's just going to ruin everything and be catastrophic.

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,840
 So today we're just going to look at that and see, well then how is it that we can live?

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,720
 Well when we need to be wise, and what does that look like?

43
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,100
 So we'll look at it together.

44
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,240
 So the first verse we see, "As the dead flies give perfume a bad smell, so little folly

45
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,880
 outweighs wisdom and honor."

46
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,200
 Now perfume is supposed to be a great scent, right?

47
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,920
 It's a nice sweet aroma and you spray a little bit on it.

48
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,840
 I'm sure the ladies like it a bit more than the men.

49
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,920
 And then you smell great, but you don't want someone to sniff you and say, "Oh, what's

50
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,440
 that smell?"

51
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,720
 Because there's a dead fly that could have been decaying inside of it, right?

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,200
 And so in the second verse it also says, "The heart of the wise inclined to the right, but

53
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,560
 the heart of the fool to the left."

54
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,520
 Now this is not like a physical checkout where we're going to see, all right, is your heart

55
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,880
 on the right side or the left side?

56
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,420
 But it's really saying how the wise and the foolish people can have a world of difference.

57
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,120
 They're going in different directions.

58
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,240
 And the wise are going for the right side.

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,180
 And right actually in the Hebrew means what is favorable, what is good.

60
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,080
 And so in verse three, we see that, "Even as fools walk along the road, they lack sense

61
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,120
 and show everyone how stupid they are."

62
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,440
 I actually quite love the Bible here because, I mean, I love the Bible everywhere, but here

63
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
 it actually says stupid.

64
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,560
 You're like, "Oh, so we can actually use the word stupid, which is great."

65
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,640
 But I think more of it is just showing that the word of God is trying to tell us that

66
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,080
 the people who lack sense, even when they walk around, they are already sending out

67
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,960
 the message, "I'm stupid, I'm stupid, I'm stupid," to everybody and you can't miss it.

68
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:27,240
 So recently, this month, there has been a number of doctors, right, you may have noticed,

69
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
 arrested.

70
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,280
 For what issue?

71
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,000
 Doing false COVID vaccination examinations, right?

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,720
 For the price of, I mean, I didn't know this, not because of my personal experience, but

73
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,920
 only because I read the news, $500 to $3,000 a piece.

74
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,360
 So from this February until now, I mean, they could have easily made millions, if not tens

75
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,120
 of million dollars.

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,000
 Now some of the patients were also arrested.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,400
 Now studying medicine is not easy, right?

78
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,440
 And so they have already become professionals, they're doctors.

79
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,440
 And now they're going to lose everything.

80
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,160
 They're going to lose the money, they're going to lose their freedom, and they're going to

81
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,080
 lose their prestige.

82
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,000
 They lose everything because of one mistake that they made.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,680
 And that's the kind of folly, the stupidity that they're going through.

84
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,800
 And now, why would somebody do this?

85
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,160
 Why do you think someone would choose foolishness over being wise?

86
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,320
 Doing bad instead of good, why do you think they choose that?

87
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,360
 Well, you know what?

88
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,860
 Because it feels good.

89
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,160
 It feels good to make money that's really fast.

90
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,360
 It feels good that you don't have to work hard for it.

91
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,280
 And it feels good even for some people to have the excitement of adultery, right?

92
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,720
 And it feels good to just be a potato couch and not do any exercise.

93
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,640
 So everything, all the reasons, maybe not all of it, but one of the reasons that people

94
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,520
 would choose to not do good and wise things is because doing bad actually feels quite

95
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,740
 good.

96
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,920
 And that's what we have seen from the beginning of the Bible, Adam and Eve, right?

97
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,480
 I don't think I need to tell you more about.

98
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,600
 And just one mistake and everybody needs to die.

99
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,280
 So I mean, I hope that every day we are not faced with such crucial decisions.

100
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,240
 But yet, Ecclesiastes chapter 10 is really telling us just a little bit of folly is just

101
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,640
 going to make everything go bad.

102
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,800
 Now, so we need to desire for what is good.

103
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,880
 Here in the second verse, it was telling us that the good, their heart inclines to the

104
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,160
 right, but the foolish people to the opposite side, right?

105
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,560
 Now the very first thing that we need is to choose good instead of feeling good.

106
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,320
 And we need to desire for what's good.

107
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,440
 Do you desire for what's good?

108
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,920
 I mean, most of the time we do until it's very uncomfortable for us and then we don't

109
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,520
 want to do it.

110
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,280
 So we need to overcome that.

111
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,640
 We need to discipline ourselves.

112
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,960
 Maybe it means sleeping early.

113
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,960
 I know I'm guilty.

114
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,760
 My mom's always like, "Why is your light still on?"

115
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,840
 And I'm like, "Oh, I'm just watching one more YouTube videos."

116
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
 And then what are we eating?

117
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,880
 We're choosing the fatty meats, right?

118
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,680
 Those are the good ones.

119
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:45,440
 And often we just want to do whatever it is that pleases our body instead of what is good.

120
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,980
 So interestingly enough, you know how many people want healthy body?

121
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,960
 Maybe many do, but actually not many people follow through with the action and the discipline

122
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
 that is required.

123
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,500
 And so here, if we're thinking about, okay, all right, so the Bible says a little bit

124
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:11,160
 of folly is dangerous, a little bit of bad is going to be catastrophic.

125
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,600
 What should we do?

126
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,800
 Choose good by desiring it and also secondly, doing it, actually doing it.

127
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,840
 I mean, I've heard many times, sometimes I send some links to people.

128
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,600
 I'm like, "Hey, this is good for you.

129
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,920
 You should try this out."

130
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,600
 And they always say, "Yeah, I already know this."

131
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,680
 I'm like, "Okay, are you doing it?"

132
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,960
 They're like, "Nah, not doing it."

133
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,840
 And so it's one thing to desire good for our hearts inclined to the right, but second to

134
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,920
 actually live it out so we don't communicate to people, "I'm stupid, I'm stupid, I'm stupid,

135
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,600
 I'm stupid," because we need to choose that.

136
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,200
 Now in verse four it says, "If a ruler's anger arises against you, do not leave your post.

137
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,940
 Calmness can lay great offenses to rest."

138
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:07,320
 Now here's a situation where a ruler is angry, but instead of being scared or throwing the

139
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,960
 towel and just, "I'm going to leave.

140
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,360
 I don't want to do this anymore."

141
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,200
 This person actually has calmness, has a kind of attitude that helps this person takes care

142
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,940
 of the situation.

143
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,320
 Now it's only human response, right?

144
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,280
 I mean, who likes it when someone...

145
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,520
 I mean, this person is saying there's someone angry, right?

146
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,160
 It's actually a ruler that's angry.

147
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,760
 Now who likes it when you see an angry person coming towards you?

148
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,400
 Husbands?

149
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,920
 Wives?

150
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,440
 Anybody?

151
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,760
 I mean, what do we do?

152
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,480
 As they're coming in, "Oh my goodness, I'm going to dodge.

153
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
 Where's the exit?

154
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,400
 I just want to leave.

155
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,040
 I don't want to confront it.

156
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,040
 I won't do anything."

157
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,000
 Now I don't have a problem with facing someone with anger, but I have the problem with the

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,520
 next part, which is staying calm.

159
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,520
 Staying calm.

160
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,480
 I mean, what is that?

161
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,320
 It's like, well, because when someone says it, you're like, "Well, I didn't do this.

162
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,320
 Somebody else did."

163
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,080
 Well, if you didn't do it, I wouldn't do it.

164
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:16,360
 And so what we find is that we either run away from the situation, okay?

165
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,440
 Or when we're facing it, we're so angry that there's conflicts and conflicts.

166
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:28,360
 So here it says that this person is using calmness, okay?

167
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,800
 Kind of an attitude, is negotiating, is listening, is compromising, is talking through things

168
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,400
 in order to solve the problems.

169
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,520
 And this is wise, and this will take away a lot of follies.

170
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:49,240
 I know a lot of marriages, they might break down because of why.

171
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,480
 You can't really practice this, can you?

172
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,000
 It's hard.

173
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,600
 But what we want to do is we want to purge all this folly out.

174
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
 Maybe it'll save your marriage.

175
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,520
 If we purge this foolishness out, maybe it'll save our job.

176
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,800
 We won't have to go to prison.

177
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:17,040
 Maybe we don't have to go through all these hardships with our jobs, our relationships,

178
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,100
 our study.

179
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:27,440
 And so these are the things that we must consider when we want to live a life that is wise.

180
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:36,680
 Now as we read on, we're going to see in verse 5, 5, 6, 7, actually the entire chapter is

181
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,960
 about foolishness and stupidity, so we're going to see more of it.

182
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,100
 So verse 5 it says, "There is an evil I have seen under the sun, the sort of error that

183
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,640
 arises from a ruler.

184
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,360
 Nobles are put in many high positions, while rich occupy the low ones.

185
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,520
 I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves."

186
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:07,180
 Now the next stupidity that we see is the wrong people are being put to do certain things

187
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,040
 that they cannot actually fulfill.

188
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,580
 Now fools are being put on high positions and the rich and low ones, slaves on horseback

189
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,360
 and the nobles on foot.

190
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,220
 And so there is a mismatch.

191
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:27,820
 And do you know that sometimes we can be foolish and we can have a mismatch as well?

192
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:38,080
 I mean, do we make all the time good friends or sometimes we make harmful friends?

193
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:46,040
 And do we go after a job that is satisfying or sometimes we go for jobs that are a mismatch

194
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
 for us?

195
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,880
 And we have to think about it.

196
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,920
 Are we putting the right people to the right things?

197
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,520
 So the second thing that we must do in order to purge this foolishness out is that we must

198
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,760
 be extra cautious.

199
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,840
 Now how can we be extra cautious?

200
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,880
 Well let's put the right people with the right things.

201
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:14,120
 Take the time to meet the right people and find a church that is going to help you grow,

202
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,800
 which is right here.

203
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,440
 And also you will try to do a job that is satisfying for you.

204
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,760
 You need to take the time to do that.

205
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
 You need to observe.

206
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,800
 You need to ask people around.

207
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,800
 And that's how it is that we can have the right fit.

208
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,520
 Actually I'm just going to add on.

209
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,680
 Now that I just see Agnes right here, I still remember when I first came to the job, this

210
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,760
 place requires like a number of references and I had interviews after interviews and

211
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,920
 I thought, "Oh my goodness, when is that going to finish?"

212
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,000
 And I mean it just shows the amount of diligence.

213
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,040
 And actually we need to do that too.

214
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,760
 If we're extra cautious, we're putting the right people with the right things at the

215
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,440
 right time.

216
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,840
 And so this is the kind of action that we can do in order to purge that fooliness.

217
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,280
 All right so let's read on.

218
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
 Verse 8 and 9.

219
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,120
 "Whoever digs a pit may fall into it.

220
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,060
 Whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.

221
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:16,880
 Whoever quarries stones may be injured by them.

222
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,520
 Whoever splits logs may be endangered by them."

223
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:27,160
 Now people who dig pits know actually that there's a possibility to fall in it, right?

224
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,760
 And people in the past actually when they made these walls, there were stones and then

225
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,800
 they mixed it with motar.

226
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:40,720
 And so snakes could easily have been creeped in and it would have made a home for the snakes.

227
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,720
 And so what we see is actually that these are actually quite predictable things.

228
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,840
 These are not things that will never happen or we've never heard of them.

229
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:57,560
 But the thing is, if we are to be wise, then we need to take precaution.

230
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,740
 We need to think about what might happen.

231
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,240
 We just don't go about our day not thinking about the danger or the possibility of these

232
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,960
 negative things happening.

233
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,000
 But we take precaution and that way we're going to be able to live wise.

234
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,600
 Otherwise, you know, I've heard some people say, "Well, God didn't protect me because

235
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,520
 you know I was out doing this and something happened to me."

236
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:29,500
 But the thing is, did we do enough of a precaution to prevent what might possibly happen to us?

237
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,880
 And if we do, then we are being wise.

238
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
 Now let's read on.

239
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:42,000
 So verse 10 to 11, "If the axe is dull and its edge unsharpened, more strength is needed,

240
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,340
 but skill will bring success.

241
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:50,200
 If a snake bites before it is charmed, the charmer receives no fee."

242
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,360
 Now these two verses tell us something slightly different, okay?

243
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:04,060
 Because an axe is a tool that you would use if you were trying to cut a tree or, but however,

244
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,180
 it is unsharpened, okay?

245
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,260
 And even though the snake charmer might be present or around, but he doesn't come in

246
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,140
 time to charm the snake.

247
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,540
 So what does it say?

248
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:22,840
 Well, it means that more than just taking precaution, we actually need to be prepared.

249
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
 We need to be prepared.

250
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,820
 So if you're going to do that job, if you're going to use that axe, well, sharpen it.

251
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,680
 Well, if you're going to be the snake charmer, which I guess none of us are here, but whatever

252
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,300
 it is that you need to do, you need to think ahead, prepare for it.

253
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,900
 You don't just go there and, "Oh, it already happened?

254
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,940
 Okay, I guess you don't need me."

255
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,500
 And then I'll go.

256
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,940
 So planning ahead now.

257
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,940
 And then just like me, I mean, I'm planning ahead for the arrival of baby.

258
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
 Yes.

259
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,980
 I mean, I do the necessary checkups.

260
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,260
 I go to the hospital to make sure my file's in there.

261
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:04,180
 I mean, we would go about buying the strollers, the baby bottles, and just preparing for everything.

262
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,980
 I mean, hopefully no one waits to the last day, "Oh, I'm giving birth."

263
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,900
 Wait, there's no bed for the baby.

264
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,260
 So we don't do that because we prepare ahead of time.

265
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:21,060
 And we should do that with the things and decisions that we make as well.

266
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:27,940
 And so if we take extra caution with the things that we do, then we are going to purge out

267
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:35,380
 that stupidity, the falliness that the author is telling us.

268
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,140
 Now as we read on, we'll read the last section.

269
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:44,980
 Verse 12 to 15, it says, "Words from the mouth of the wise are gracious, but fools are consumed

270
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,180
 by their own lips.

271
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,020
 At the beginning, their words are folly, and at the end are wicked madness.

272
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,980
 And fools multiply words.

273
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,800
 No one knows what is coming.

274
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,980
 Who can tell someone else what will happen after them?

275
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,800
 The toil of fools wearies them.

276
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,980
 They do not know the way to town."

277
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,500
 Now essentially, we've read quite a few verse, you're like, "Okay, seems like there's some

278
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,140
 things to do with stupid talking and whatnot."

279
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,420
 And so essentially, these three verses actually means that fools don't know what they're talking

280
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,700
 about.

281
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,300
 And the words that they say, maybe many, I mean, just because you say a lot of things,

282
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,040
 which I do too, doesn't mean you're stupid.

283
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:39,240
 But it just means that when you say things and they actually are stupid, it has no meaning.

284
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,300
 And these people actually, when we see them, they are proud.

285
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
 How do we know that?

286
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,100
 Well, the first thing is their lips are harsh.

287
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,980
 And the second thing is they talk as if they know the future.

288
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,380
 They talk as if they know the future.

289
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,220
 And it says right here, "But no one knows what is to come."

290
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:09,380
 Now, interestingly enough, in these verses, verse 13, it actually says, "At the end,"

291
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,340
 so at the beginning, their words are folly.

292
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,560
 At the end, they are wicked madness.

293
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:23,560
 Now how is it possible that as we talk and talk and talk, we become wicked?

294
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,160
 What do you think this is saying?

295
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:33,400
 Well, it's trying to tell us that if we think we're able to know what tomorrow is going

296
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,520
 to happen and we speak as if we are God, that is evil.

297
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:45,200
 Now in James 4, 13-16, we won't read it together, but I'll tell you that what it talks about

298
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,040
 is that there's someone who actually boasts about what he will do today and tomorrow,

299
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,520
 and even next year.

300
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:59,200
 But the Bible says, "You don't even know what will happen tomorrow, so why boast these schemes?"

301
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,560
 And it actually says, "All such boasting is evil."

302
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,400
 Now the reason that the Bible is telling us that it's evil is because of not the words

303
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,020
 they say, but of their proudness and of their boastfulness.

304
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,840
 And so when we have this attitude that I know everything, I even know...

305
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,800
 For me, I can't even say, "Okay, three months from now, baby will come out."

306
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,520
 You know how I should say it?

307
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:34,160
 Like what the Bible says, "If the Lord wills, three months later, this might happen."

308
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,200
 Because we really don't know what's going to happen.

309
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:45,200
 And so for us, this brings us to our third point, which is we need to acknowledge God.

310
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,960
 If we want to purge all this foolishness, this out of our lives, we need to acknowledge

311
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
 God.

312
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,720
 We don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

313
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,320
 We can't be prideful.

314
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,640
 And if we humble ourselves and leave room for God to know that everything's under His

315
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,080
 sovereignty, He's going to take care of it all.

316
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,960
 I mean, I can only plan and do my best, but you need to leave room for God.

317
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,280
 He can do still whatever it is that He wants.

318
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,560
 And so in verse 16 and 17, as we read on, it says, "Woe to the land whose king was a

319
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,720
 servant and whose princes feast in the morning.

320
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:32,400
 Blessed is the land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time

321
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,560
 for strength and not for drunkenness.

322
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:43,800
 Though laziness the rafters sank, because of idle hands the house leaks."

323
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:52,480
 Now the author is trying to move away from everyday life to a ruler, a king.

324
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,960
 It is saying that this king, this king who was a servant, his sons, which are the princes,

325
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,600
 they're feasting in the morning time.

326
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,040
 And when we hear morning time, we know that it means they're doing self-indulgence, which

327
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:12,880
 means that they're just enjoying it over excessively for themselves.

328
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,760
 And then on the other hand, there is a king who is born of noble birth and his sons, how

329
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,760
 do they eat?

330
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
 They ate properly.

331
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:27,160
 I mean, not properly, like not spilling stuff, but they ate proper for strength and not for

332
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,160
 self-indulgence.

333
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,360
 And so what does this tell us?

334
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,240
 Well, in order that we acknowledge God, we need to actually be good stewards of what

335
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,720
 he has given us.

336
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,880
 Just because he has allowed you to be king, princes, or I mean, none of us are here, but

337
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,400
 we have a lot of resources and talents that God has given to us.

338
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,600
 And if we acknowledge that it's God who gave it to us, we're not going to be foolish.

339
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,480
 We're not going to like just use it for our own enjoyment only.

340
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,680
 We're going to consider what is proper and we're just going to use the right amount and

341
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,480
 we're going to consider what other people need as well.

342
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,600
 So we need to be good stewards.

343
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,960
 And in verse 19 and 20, it says, "A feast is made for laughter and wine makes life merry

344
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,720
 and money is the answer for everything."

345
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,000
 So there's the Bible quote, "Money is the answer for everything."

346
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,680
 Do not revile the king, even in your thoughts, but don't take it out of context.

347
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,880
 Do not revile the king, even in your thoughts or curse the rich in your bedroom, because

348
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,640
 a bird in the sky may carry your words and a bird on the wing may report what you say.

349
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,800
 And so here in these last two verses, we're like, "Oh, I'm not quite sure how it fits

350
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,160
 in with everything else."

351
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,800
 I mean, actually the entire chapter, you have this sense of not sure how it fits in with

352
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,080
 everything.

353
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:55,500
 But it seems like these king and princes who are of high power, they are actually affecting

354
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,880
 the society.

355
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,280
 They're using the resources in a way that it doesn't leave much for the other people,

356
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,960
 or they're just thinking about themselves.

357
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:12,000
 Now a lot of us, a lot of people actually, they might be quite angry with the rulers,

358
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 with the princes.

359
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,720
 We're going to be like, "Why are they doing this?"

360
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,120
 And what would you do?

361
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,020
 Because there's nothing much you can do.

362
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,880
 So you just go to your bedroom and you start cursing them.

363
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,080
 And you start complaining, and maybe to your family members, "You can't believe, why would

364
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,980
 they do this?"

365
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,320
 And then it says, "Actually, don't do that.

366
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
 Don't do that."

367
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:37,480
 But it doesn't quite tell us, "Well, okay, well, the birds are going to report it.

368
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,080
 Okay, well, Twitter?

369
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
 Is it Twitter?

370
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
 I don't know."

371
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,840
 I mean, what is that, right?

372
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,280
 But it just means that actually as we have this attitude, it's just still going to flow

373
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
 out.

374
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,480
 If you're going to be cursing someone, we'll be holding grudges against the people that

375
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,080
 you feel like are unjust, it's just going to flow out.

376
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,840
 And at the same time, not only does it flow out, but you know what it means?

377
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,240
 It means that we think we're better than them.

378
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,960
 The only time we complain, curse, is because we think we're more righteous than someone

379
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,800
 else.

380
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,880
 But let's not do that.

381
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,920
 That's foolishness.

382
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,920
 Let's acknowledge God and let him be the judge.

383
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,600
 That's the last part of acknowledging God.

384
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,760
 I mean, it's not...

385
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,240
 The next slide.

386
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:40,480
 It's not easy for us to be able to live this life without any foolishness.

387
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:48,760
 But in this chapter, it actually gives us a lot of hope because if we are actually following

388
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:55,560
 God, if we only do or at least try our very best with the help of the Lord to do whatever

389
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:04,680
 it is good to desire for those things instead of our own feelings, it's going to be wise

390
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,680
 for us.

391
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,800
 Can we go to the next slide as well?

392
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:18,520
 And also, when we are extra cautious, when we put the right people with the right tasks,

393
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:26,720
 take the precaution that we need and we prepare ourselves, that we can purge away the foolishness.

394
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,280
 And lastly, when we fear God, acknowledge him, we leave room for him to do whatever

395
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:38,360
 it is that he wants, we're always remembering that he is the one in control, being good

396
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,560
 stewards.

397
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:45,120
 And even if we see things that we feel like we're doing better than others, we're leaving

398
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,560
 God to judge.

399
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:55,080
 Now, recently I'm getting a new helper at home to assist with the baby as soon as it

400
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,520
 comes out, it, I'm still calling it it right now.

401
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:09,760
 I have to say that she, not she, the helper, is wiser than myself.

402
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,960
 Now I almost let a little folly make a big mess.

403
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,720
 Now what happened was that after I've signed the contract with her, we needed to wait for

404
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,240
 her visa.

405
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,740
 And so meanwhile, she was staying in an auntie's place at a certain amount of money and she

406
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,920
 gets food and accommodation.

407
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,120
 Now I just thought to myself, well, since I have a room in my apartment, an extra room,

408
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,240
 why don't I just ask her to come and stay with us?

409
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,880
 Because I just thought, well, she's not working, I'm not going to pay her.

410
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,000
 And she's just going to stay there and the visa will come out, you know, everything is

411
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,040
 just going to be smooth.

412
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,600
 We're not breaking any laws, it sounds reasonable.

413
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,160
 And she's agreed to it.

414
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,960
 And then a few days later, I've spoken to her, I mean, a few days later after this spoken

415
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
 arrangement, she text me.

416
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,800
 And then she showed me a news of some Filipino helpers that were arrested and exported because

417
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,640
 they were working illegally at bakeries, bars and restaurants.

418
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,680
 Now I asked her, I said, well, are you worried?

419
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:13,520
 Are you worried that if you come over to stay with us that something similar might happen?

420
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,400
 And she told me that, oh, maybe it is best that she continues to stay at her auntie's

421
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,440
 place until her visa comes out.

422
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,140
 Now I've originally actually agreed that I would pay for part of that accommodation.

423
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:31,600
 Now she told me actually, don't worry about it because she has enough money from the previous

424
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,240
 employer who purchased a ticket for her to go back home, but she's not flying home.

425
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,520
 So she says she's got enough to stay at this accommodation.

426
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,040
 And also she says she's quite thankful that she will be working with us, a Christian family,

427
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,560
 because she's also a Christian.

428
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:55,260
 And so when I thought about this, I just realized that, you know, what I had done a little folly

429
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,280
 on my part could have been dangerous.

430
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,000
 But yet she was wise.

431
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 You know what she did?

432
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,440
 She chose good instead of feeling good because it would have felt good if somebody else,

433
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,880
 I mean, if she stayed with me, then she wouldn't need to pay for accommodations, right?

434
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,120
 It would feel good towards her.

435
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,540
 But despite the fact that she would save money and also secure the job, right?

436
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,400
 Because who knows if visa is really going to end up coming or not.

437
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:29,000
 She actually desired for good to keep that boundary absolutely clean with her decisions.

438
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,700
 I mean, what's going to happen?

439
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,480
 If somebody actually caught us and then we said, "Oh no, she's not working.

440
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,280
 I'm not giving her money."

441
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
 How are we going to prove that, right?

442
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,400
 But she desired what's good and then she also executed it.

443
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,840
 But what I really liked was her attitude because actually she was having that calmness that

444
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,320
 we talked about earlier, which was she sent the article to me so that I would read it.

445
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,320
 And instead of, you know, how sometimes you want to bring up a situation and if you've

446
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,400
 got very frank and go directly into it, someone might feel offended, right?

447
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,400
 But she didn't do that.

448
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,840
 She's like, "Oh, I've seen this.

449
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,320
 What do you think?"

450
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,040
 And I just really admired her for the amount of good attitude that she had.

451
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:24,800
 And just to make sure that we wouldn't come off already at the beginning being misunderstood.

452
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:31,440
 And finally, just seeing that how she's taking that precaution to be extra careful so that

453
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,120
 even if somebody found out, even though we're not doing anything technically illegal, that

454
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,080
 it would still be clean.

455
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,920
 And lastly, I think she really acknowledged God, that she was a good steward of the money.

456
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,880
 I didn't expect her to say that, "Okay, I'm just going to use the flight money and it's

457
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
 okay."

458
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,000
 You know, for her to really come out and say that, I just have a lot of respect for her.

459
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,400
 And out of this, I really saw that a little folly can be dangerous.

460
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,600
 Now imagine if we went ahead with it.

461
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,260
 I mean, if nothing happened, it would have been fine, right?

462
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:12,920
 But if something awful had happened, she could have been deported, blacklisted, and I would

463
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,640
 have no helper.

464
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,640
 All because of a little folly, a little convenience.

465
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,440
 And recently, for me, there's all these kinds of things that would happen every day.

466
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,600
 For example, I was considering to go fly to Japan.

467
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,160
 And of course, me, my mom, my friends all said, "Okay, let's go, let's go."

468
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,760
 And so we were going to travel agents and everything.

469
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:42,920
 And finally, one of our friends says, "Hey, you know what?

470
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,160
 Thought about it.

471
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,000
 Let's take extra precaution.

472
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,720
 It might be dangerous going up high and coming back low."

473
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,880
 So I mean, just with our everyday life things.

474
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,800
 Even yesterday, okay, I was tempted.

475
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:00,440
 We were at a buffet and there was this toro sushi.

476
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,760
 Okay, so I had one.

477
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,600
 Wait, two, I think.

478
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,840
 I failed there.

479
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,320
 A little bit of folly.

480
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,680
 But what I wanted to say is, yes, sometimes, because we seem to get by with things, and

481
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,000
 we made it, and it makes us more risk-taking.

482
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,120
 Let's do this, let's do that.

483
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,840
 But think about it.

484
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,540
 There are big and small decisions.

485
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:31,280
 And I'm praying for protection for my toro yesterday, but I've almost sensed that I'm

486
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,720
 testing God.

487
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,020
 But what we really need to do, if we really don't want this dunk, ooh, it's floating around

488
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,320
 up here, in our lives.

489
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,040
 If that tastes sauce, don't worry.

490
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,440
 Let us not have even a little bit of foolishness.

491
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,000
 Let us purge that out.

492
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:02,360
 Let us live out this, choosing good, being extra cautious, acknowledging God in all we

493
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:09,600
 do, so that God can bless us with the plans that he originally has for us.

494
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,080
 And at the same time, we live for the glory of God.

495
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:19,040
 I mean, I can't imagine me going up on the news saying, "Oh, there's a pastor of a certain

496
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,120
 church illegally hiring a helper."

497
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,400
 There is no glory to that, for sure.

498
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:35,320
 And so, let us really allow Holy Spirit, every day with our decisions, to make wise ones,

499
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:42,100
 purge out every single foolishness that can possibly be there.

500
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,880
 So let's pray together and ask God to continue to help us.

501
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,400
 Yehevni, Father, we thank you for your word.

502
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:57,280
 We thank you that you are the one that is full of wisdom, and you are the one that blesses

503
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,200
 us with all good things.

504
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:07,560
 And Father, we just pray that as we live out this life, that we remember to acknowledge

505
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:15,520
 you, and that we remember that when we do all the things that we do, that, Father, it

506
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,360
 is not for ourselves.

507
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:26,240
 Because if we want to follow our own desires, it just means that we don't consider you to

508
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
 be our Lord.

509
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:35,480
 But if we do, and I believe that all of us who are here online, if we believe and know

510
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,280
 that you are our Lord, let us, Father, desire what you desire.

511
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,240
 Let us have that discipline to do what is good.

512
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,440
 Let us pay that extra precaution so that you can bless us.

513
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,280
 And let us always acknowledge you and fear you, because you are a God that is worthy

514
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,680
 of praise.

515
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,760
 And so, Father, we just pray that every day, if we're confused, that you speak to us through

516
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,240
 your Holy Spirit.

517
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,520
 Don't do this.

518
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,640
 Do that.

519
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,960
 Don't be mad.

520
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,760
 Say this instead.

521
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,880
 Don't be scared.

522
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,560
 Go boldly.

523
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:21,240
 And so, Father, we just, we're your children, and we await for you.

524
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:29,160
 Thank you so much for loving us and to guide us into a life that is just a great relationship

525
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,720
 that we can walk with you.

526
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,720
 Thank you, Father.

527
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

528
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
 Amen.
