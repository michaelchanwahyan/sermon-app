[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hey, everyone.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   It feels really strange having the whole middle.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.600]   And this is a new prop because of our series,
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.440]   don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.280]   So I am sitting here at a table without another chair
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.080]   so the enemy can't sit here.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720]   Good to see you all.
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.920]   What a weekend, eh?
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.600]   It's going to be a big one, isn't it, John?
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.280]   There's the Wimbledon final.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.320]   There's the NBA finals.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.320]   And every sentence that John starts with this week,
[00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.320]   every phrase he starts with, it's coming home.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.440]   It's coming home.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.640]   And it's going to be-- see, maybe this
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.160]   is where John and I are different.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.280]   John is an optimist.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.760]   So everything-- it's always going to be coming home.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.040]   But maybe it's the football club that I support.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.400]   It's a club called Arsenal.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.120]   And it's-- wow.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.720]   Wow.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.520]   So it's a learned behavior that we have,
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.880]   is that never expect too much.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.680]   Because we've experienced so much heartache.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.680]   So I can tell you it's probably coming home.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.280]   Maybe.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.560]   It's going to go to a home.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.680]   But maybe that's just the way I'm wired.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.200]   Because that-- at least with Arsenal.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.400]   We have this saying that-- people
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.720]   have this saying against us, is that we're-- the team
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.720]   are a bunch of fair weather men.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.560]   Fair weather men means they only do well
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.360]   when everything is going really well.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.320]   But when it's raining, or when it's stormy,
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.400]   or as they would say in England, on a cold, dark November
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.320]   night in Stoke-on-Trent, Arsenal always
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.280]   loses, because we're just not very good when
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.800]   the going gets tough.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.280]   And maybe that's an interesting one that we all can figure out.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.760]   Maybe I'll ask you a question to start with.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.600]   What are you like when the going gets tough?
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.280]   What are you like when things get a little bit hard?
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.720]   When it gets a bit colder?
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.120]   When it gets a bit rainier?
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.760]   When the storms are coming?
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.680]   What are you like?
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.080]   In some ways, I guess, when the going gets tough
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.480]   is where our true self gets exposed, right?
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.760]   It gets revealed.
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.840]   Because that's when we finally show who we truly are.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.000]   When everything's going well, when the weather is shining
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.720]   on a perfect May afternoon, Arsenal play very well.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.960]   But when it's cold and dark in November
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.000]   in this dark, horrible place called Stoke-on-Trent,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.240]   they struggle.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.160]   When the going gets tough, they struggle.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.760]   And you see, it's interesting for us,
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.600]   because as we're going to look through this series,
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.640]   don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.440]   It's focusing on Psalm 23.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.920]   And you all probably know Psalm 23.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.080]   It's probably the most famous passage of scripture, right?
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.760]   But I wanted to ask you another question.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.480]   If I was to boil down what Psalm 23 is really about,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.160]   what would you say it's about?
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.200]   The Lord is my shepherd, and I will dwell in the house
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.040]   of the Lord forever.
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.120]   What's it really about?
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.440]   This short chapter, the most famous chapter of six verses,
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.880]   what's it really about?
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.000]   I think it's about how you face challenges,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.360]   how you respond.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.720]   They often say, it's not really what happens to you
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.320]   that matters, it's how you respond, right?
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.440]   In some ways, Psalm 23, which I'm trying to find here,
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.560]   is about that.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.080]   It's about how we respond to challenges.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.760]   It's about how much we trust in God,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.560]   and how much we trust in the truth.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.720]   That's why truth and trust are so similar.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.120]   How much do we trust in God is what Psalm 23 is about.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.280]   And I wanted to go through this
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.680]   because it's very important as we look at
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.520]   how we don't give the enemy a seat at the table.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.640]   It really comes down to how tight
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.480]   are we holding on to truth?
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.360]   You see, one thing that is for sure,
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.640]   if we invite the enemy to our table,
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.880]   he really wants to bring about our destruction.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.880]   That's his purpose, that's his goal.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.040]   And how does he often do that?
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.240]   Through deceit, through lies,
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.320]   through the very thing against truth.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.400]   That's how he does it.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.640]   He wants to tell you, he wants you to feel
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.080]   that you have no value, that you have no worth,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.640]   that you have no purpose, that no one loves you.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.240]   Nicky Gumbel often shares a story that's been in my head,
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.360]   and I'm paraphrasing it 'cause I don't remember all of it,
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.480]   but he's telling this imaginary story
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.720]   of the devil talking to his demons,
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.520]   and they're scheming on how to distract
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.360]   the people of earth from God.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.040]   And they're like, "Oh, what about if we feed them the lie
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.080]   "that all they need is money, sex, and power?"
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.120]   And he's like, "No, no, no,
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.440]   "because at some point they'll find out.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.920]   "At some point, as they go down this road,
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.280]   "they'll realize that that doesn't fulfill."
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.960]   And fast forward to the end, he says,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.600]   "The best lie that we can tell them
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.400]   "is that there is no hurry,
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.560]   "that there may be a God, that he really may love you,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.920]   "that you really should follow him,
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.720]   "but the lie is there's no hurry.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.800]   "Let's feed them the lie that there is no hurry,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.120]   "that they can put it back to tomorrow.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.520]   "Maybe that's the most dangerous lie."
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.160]   So how are we supposed to face these kinds of lies?
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.000]   How are we supposed to face this kind of deceit?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.440]   By looking at the word of God, by looking at the truth.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.600]   And I would say in the whole of scripture,
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.280]   Psalm 23 is probably the most powerful,
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.160]   most potent, most appropriate passage
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.760]   for how you respond to challenges,
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.640]   how you face the enemy.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.680]   Because in Ephesians chapter six,
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.600]   Paul talks about the whole armor of God.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.360]   And what's the sword of the spirit?
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's the word of God.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.120]   So the question really is, how well do we know Psalm 23?
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.560]   Those of us who have been in the church for a long time
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.160]   will have sang songs about Psalm 23, right?
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   How well do we know?
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.520]   Do we know it off by heart?
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.840]   Do we know it in our hearts?
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.520]   And I wanted to read it to you first.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.760]   I want to just recite it to you,
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.280]   but I want you to think about this.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.680]   When David is writing this passage, these six verses,
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.800]   what is he really saying?
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.920]   What does he want us to know?
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.760]   When he says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.880]   He makes me lie in green pastures.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.200]   He leads me beside still waters.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.520]   He restores my soul.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.880]   Even though I walk through the valley
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.800]   of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.480]   for you are with me, your rod and your staff,
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.480]   they comfort me.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.520]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.720]   You anoint my head with oil and my cup overflows.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.640]   Surely, goodness and mercy will follow me
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.280]   all the days of my life, and I shall dwell
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.720]   in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.600]   That is the word of God.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.400]   That is the truth that we should be following.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.720]   That is the truth that we should be remembering
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.800]   in our hearts, living it.
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.120]   Psalm 23 is an interesting one,
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.400]   'cause where do you hear about Psalm 23 the most?
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.720]   Where do you hear it read the most?
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   Funerals, 'cause it's always associated with death, right?
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.560]   Dying, it's the encouragement for everyone.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.280]   But what I want to propose to you today,
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.600]   what I want to present to you today
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.480]   is it isn't really just about death.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.920]   In fact, it's much more about living than you realize.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.240]   Confession to make, John last week when he was sharing,
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.440]   he gave you all a preview saying,
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.320]   "James is gonna present a Psalm 23 remix."
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.840]   And I was listening to that bit, and I was like,
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.800]   "Oh, I am," 'cause I hadn't written the sermon at that time,
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.360]   and I suddenly was wondering what kind of remix should I do?
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.360]   You definitely don't want to hear me rap.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.480]   That's a definite no-no.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.320]   - Oh, come on.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.440]   - And then I thought, you know what?
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.520]   And I was like, "God, please tell me.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.960]   Please tell me how to make this kind of interesting
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.080]   for all these brothers and sisters
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.440]   who probably know this passage very well."
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.520]   And then it occurred to me,
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.480]   if we're talking about not giving the enemy
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.200]   a seat at the table, what if we did?
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.600]   What if we did let the enemy sit here?
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.920]   And what if we did believe in his lies?
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.080]   What if we let him distort this truth?
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.800]   I want to present to you the, well, I just recited
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.440]   the Lord is my shepherd in the ESV,
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.360]   the English Standard Version,
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.560]   but I wanted to present to you a different version today
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.520]   in parallel, which is the ERV, the Enemy Remixed Version.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.640]   And this is what it is.
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.560]   I want to show you the real scripture, the real truth,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.240]   but when you compare it to what I have imagined.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.160]   Now, disclaimer, I wrote it myself, okay?
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.760]   But it was me asking, "James, what would happen
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.520]   if I let the enemy have a seat at my table?
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.720]   How would he distort this scripture?
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.760]   And how would it make me feel?"
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.240]   So this is my own interpretation.
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.880]   I'm not the most creative kind of person.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.480]   And I welcome you to go back
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.920]   and maybe you can rewrite your own one,
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.200]   your own Remixed Version,
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.400]   because I think it's very important.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.960]   It really helped me.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.040]   So I want to go through each verse.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.560]   There's only six, and I want to really go through them.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.880]   The first verse, of course, is,
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.000]   "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.520]   John, last week, emphasized the word my.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.400]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.280]   There's this intimacy that comes with it.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.200]   He's mine.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.040]   He knows me.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.880]   He cares for me.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.840]   It's actually a really interesting way,
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.720]   a good way to meditate, if those of you who are learning
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.720]   and struggling, is taking a sentence such as that,
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.160]   "The Lord is my shepherd," and emphasizing different words,
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.040]   and spending time emphasizing different words.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:20.560]   So the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:22.280]   Jesus is my shepherd.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.440]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.960]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.400]   Actually, David would have very well known
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.200]   what a shepherd had to do.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.040]   He was a shepherd boy himself.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.720]   But actually, back in those days,
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.120]   for someone who was reading that,
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.480]   shepherd actually had an even stronger connotation,
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.800]   which was king.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.400]   Someone who had authority over something.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.600]   Someone who cared for something, a leader.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.720]   So what David is saying here is,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.920]   "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.440]   "He is my king.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.400]   "He knows me.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.080]   "He cares for me.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.240]   "And he looks after me.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.200]   "And I shall not want.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.560]   "And I shall not want."
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.440]   But what if you imagined if this was done
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.040]   in a remixed version, and it comes up here?
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.880]   If I was to flip it and translate it,
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.160]   if I was to invite the enemy to come and distort this truth,
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.520]   it would sound something like this.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.640]   I have no one to lead me.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.680]   No one who cares.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.360]   Nothing ever seems enough.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.200]   And as I present these parallels to you,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.840]   I want you to think, which one do you resonate more with?
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.000]   Which one do you believe more with?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.080]   Now, maybe in your head, you should believe the real one,
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.240]   but what about your actions?
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.680]   What about your actual thinking,
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.760]   your feeling, your emotions?
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.080]   Which one resonates with you more?
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.200]   See, when he says, "The Lord is my shepherd,"
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.240]   he's saying, "I have someone to lead me.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.280]   "I have someone who cares.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.960]   "I have a king.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:49.040]   "And because I have him, there is nothing that I need."
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.800]   Jesus himself introduces himself as the good shepherd.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   In John chapter 10, John chapter 10, he says this.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.640]   Verse 11, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.800]   This is just after the famous verse 10,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.640]   which is, "The thief comes only to steal
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.760]   "and kill and destroy.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.120]   "I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.040]   So Jesus talks about being the good shepherd.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.040]   And what does he mean by that?
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.320]   If you study John chapter 10,
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   you will see he's talking about he gives food,
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.680]   he protects, he sustains life.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.800]   So Jesus is saying, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.760]   You see, this is what he's saying.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.000]   This is what David is saying here.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.800]   He's saying, "If you let Jesus lead you,
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.960]   "you will find contentment.
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.400]   "You won't need anything else.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.280]   "But if you don't let Jesus lead you,
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.520]   "you will find disappointment.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.200]   "If you let Jesus lead you, you will find contentment.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.560]   "There will be nothing else that you need.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.920]   "But if you don't let him lead you,
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:45.280]   "you will find disappointment."
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.120]   Our job as a church, I strongly believe this,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.440]   as Kongfolk Church, my organisation, Young Life,
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.160]   the whole point, why we exist,
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.520]   why all of us should be here,
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.360]   is to point people to Jesus
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.920]   and to tell them that Jesus is their shepherd.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.160]   He can be the one to lead them.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.840]   They should follow him.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.480]   You see, there's something interesting here.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.840]   Because if we don't tell them that,
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.840]   if we don't tell them that Jesus should be the one
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.760]   that you should be following,
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.640]   they will follow someone else.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.160]   They will follow something else.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.760]   They will follow the world.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.680]   They will follow the role models of the world.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.560]   It's our job as his body to point them to the good shepherd,
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.200]   the one who can lead them.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.000]   Jesus says something fascinating here
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.040]   in John chapter 10, verse 12.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.400]   He says this.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.240]   He says, "I am the good shepherd.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:32.040]   "He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.080]   "who does not own the sheep,
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.400]   "sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.880]   "And the wolf snatches them.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:38.680]   "He flees because he is a hired hand
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.480]   "and cares nothing for the sheep."
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.120]   He's saying, "Hey, if you don't follow me,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.160]   "and if you follow other things,
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.960]   "if you follow the world,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.680]   "as soon as there's trouble, they will leave you
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.640]   "because they don't really care for you.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.480]   "They are not here to protect you.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.280]   "So follow me.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.480]   "And if you follow me,
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.920]   "you won't have anything that you need.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.840]   "If you don't follow me, you will always be in need
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   "and nothing, nothing will ever seem enough."
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.720]   Are we okay?
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.560]   Are we with me?
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.880]   So verse one, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.440]   "I shall not want."
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.080]   So the question is, who's your shepherd?
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.240]   Who's been leading you as you navigate the path of life?
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.400]   Is it yourself?
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.560]   Is it someone else in the world who doesn't follow Jesus?
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.920]   Is it the blind leading the blind?
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:25.240]   Can you say from the bottom of your heart
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:28.520]   that the Lord is your shepherd?
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.840]   Because if you can, then you shall not want.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.560]   Verse two says this, "He makes me lie in green pastures.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.560]   "He leads me beside still waters.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.400]   "He restores my soul."
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:47.480]   He paints this picture that God knows what you need.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.040]   He'll lead you to a place where there's green pastures.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.640]   He'll lead you to a place where there's still waters.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.200]   What are the significances of those?
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.920]   Okay, if you're sheep, you need to eat.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.520]   So then you go to these green pastures
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.920]   to the point where it's plentiful, it's everywhere.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.120]   So you actually get to lie down.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.920]   So a sheep can actually lie down
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.280]   and know that they have everything that they need.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:07.680]   Why still waters?
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.640]   Sheep would have to go to the riverside to drink water.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.280]   But if the water was running too fast,
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.720]   if the current was too fast,
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.440]   then they would get their wool wet, they would get heavy,
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.280]   and then they would run the risk of being swept away,
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.600]   whisked away, and be in danger.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.240]   So David is saying here, if the Lord is your shepherd,
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.480]   he will lead you, he will take you to places
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.240]   where you can lie down, where you can stop,
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.960]   where you will have everything that you need,
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.040]   that you don't have to keep chasing and chasing and chasing,
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.760]   because in him, there will be enough.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:44.600]   This is in direct contrast with a city like Hong Kong.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.480]   I've said this before, right?
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.720]   Hong Kong is probably one of the hardest places
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.880]   to find peace, to stop.
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.240]   Christina and I, we took our kids this week on a holiday.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.160]   We went all the way, we went really far,
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.080]   all the way to Lantau, and we went to Disneyland.
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   And it was a great time.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.640]   Disneyland is always a fun place to be.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.280]   It's the happiest place on earth.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.320]   But you know what I found something really interesting is?
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.600]   We couldn't switch off either,
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.280]   because when you're at Disneyland,
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.440]   you've got so many things that you need to get to.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.280]   You need to make the most of everything.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.480]   And as hotel guests, we were given these fast passes,
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.680]   which it didn't feel right if we let them go to waste.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.680]   So we have to go through everything.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.520]   And in the hotel, there's tons of things that you can do.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.800]   You can go go-karting.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.040]   You can do Tai Chi with Donald Duck.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.000]   No, no, no, that wasn't a joke.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.200]   You actually can do Tai Chi with Donald Duck.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.120]   Small plug there.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.440]   And I found myself getting caught up in this,
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.040]   'cause I need to make the most of it.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.120]   I need to go to all these different things.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.320]   But what Jesus is saying here,
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.800]   what Davies is saying is about Jesus,
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.520]   if you follow him, you will get to a point
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.400]   where you can lie down,
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:55.160]   where you will be surrounded by everything that you need
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.880]   that you won't even need to move that far.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.360]   And you'll be beside still waters
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.240]   where you don't feel as though
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.920]   you have to go and fight for everything yourself.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.440]   Now, there's two, generalizing,
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.480]   there's two schools of thought that you probably buy into.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.800]   You probably have a Western mindset
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.720]   where it's kind of like,
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.000]   I need to grasp everything myself.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.760]   I need to take hold of my destiny.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.400]   I need to chase my dreams and my ambitions.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.360]   Everything is me.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.400]   Take up, look after number one first.
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.800]   Well, you've got the other side, the Eastern side,
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.880]   which is you need to work very hard
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.160]   to gain any kind of approval.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.600]   You need to prove and justify your existence.
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.320]   You won't receive any love
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.840]   unless you work very, very, very hard.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.440]   You see, the problem with both of these mindsets
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.800]   is that they both will leave you wanting more.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.960]   They both will get you to a point
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.280]   where actually it's not enough.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.920]   Nothing ever seems enough.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.040]   And what David is saying here is stop.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.000]   He says it later in Psalm 46,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.120]   be still and know that I am God.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.600]   If you actually look at the context of Psalm 46,
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.920]   they're actually talking about nations raging
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.480]   and fighting against each other.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.280]   So that be still isn't be still and just chill.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.200]   It's drop your weapons, kind of stop.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.680]   It's stop what you're doing right now.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.200]   And I feel as though we need to hear that.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.880]   For those of us in Hong Kong,
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.320]   that we need to hear stop, drop whatever you're doing
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.680]   and be still and know that I am God.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   Because hurry, because busyness is directly against
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.440]   how the kingdom of God works.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.440]   And you see it time and time again in scripture
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.680]   that Jesus never seems rushed.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.280]   And he invites you in to be still,
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.920]   to lie down in the green pastures,
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.080]   to be beside the still waters.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.800]   Third verse is this, he leads me,
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.040]   oh, sorry, the remix version is this.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:46.000]   It's like I'm stranded in the desert,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.200]   desperate for something to quench my thirst,
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.960]   but no matter how hard I try, I always feel empty.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.760]   Which of these versions describes you more?
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.600]   Which of these versions describes you?
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.440]   Because it will give you a hint as to who is your shepherd,
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.560]   who's actually leading you.
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.440]   Are you stranded in the desperate desert?
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.040]   Are you desperately finding something
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.480]   to quench this thirst?
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.800]   Do you think there's something inside you
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.280]   that seems to need to be fulfilled,
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.520]   but you just keep finding it?
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.120]   You're trying to find it, but you never seem to succeed.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.760]   You find all these other things that fill it temporarily,
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.360]   but then you always get to that point
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.160]   where again, it's not enough.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.680]   Have a think, who is your shepherd?
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.440]   Now, verse three, he leads me in paths of righteousness
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.040]   for his name's sake.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.960]   The paths of righteousness isn't something too mysterious.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.680]   It simply means he leads you down the right path
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.840]   so you won't get lost.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.960]   He's taking you down the right route.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.200]   He leads you there for his name's sake,
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   which basically means it's in his nature.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.480]   It's who he is.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.200]   That's what we were singing, that God is good.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.080]   God, you're so good.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.760]   I'm so glad we sang that song.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.440]   Actually, both of them, "The Goodness of God."
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.560]   Because I think very often we don't associate good with God.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.440]   I think most of the time we think about him
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.280]   as this just distant being,
[00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.840]   this one that we should be afraid of,
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.920]   who's gonna send lightning down to destroy us
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.920]   if we misbehave.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.560]   But do you understand that he's a good God?
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.440]   Do you let that permeate your soul?
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.240]   Do you recognise, do you realise that he is actually good?
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.080]   What does that mean?
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.240]   It means that he knows what's best for you
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.160]   and that he cares for you, that he is faithful.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.080]   So for his name's sake, what is his character?
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.120]   He is good and he is faithful.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.360]   I'm reminded again of Mr. Beaver telling Lucy,
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.280]   describing Aslan.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.560]   This is the Chronicles of Narnia,
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:42.160]   for those of you who don't know,
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.080]   where Aslan is this lion that basically represents God.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.400]   And this little girl is asking, "Who is this Aslan?"
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.760]   And she's asking a talking beaver, of course, as you would.
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.520]   And Mr. Beaver says, "Oh, he's not safe.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.200]   "In fact, he's pretty dangerous.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.920]   "He's pretty powerful, but he's good."
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.920]   Do you believe that, that God truly is good,
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.280]   that he knows what's best for you?
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.560]   So during this time, as you walk this path,
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.400]   sometimes it feels like a detour.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.760]   If you truly follow God,
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.200]   there will be paths that you take,
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.920]   they will be like, "Hmm, are we sure?
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.520]   "Is this the way to be going?"
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.880]   But if you are truly following God,
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.320]   if Jesus truly is your shepherd and your eyes are on him,
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.280]   then you can trust in him and your job
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.120]   is to stay close to him.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.160]   It's to stay close to him and remember that he is good,
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.680]   that he cares for you and he knows what's best for you
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.120]   and he is faithful.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.760]   God, you're so good.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.600]   Because you need to know that
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.000]   and you need to remember that because of the next verse.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.040]   So you just etch that into your minds that God is good
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.280]   because the next verse puts that to the test.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:51.200]   Next verse is probably the most famous part of Psalm 23,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.840]   maybe the most popular part, definitely for sure,
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.160]   to the point where Coolio in "Gangster's Paradise"
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.200]   steals it and copies it as well, uses it.
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.720]   "Even though I walk through the valley
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.000]   "of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.960]   "for you are with me, your rod and your staff,
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.920]   "they comfort me."
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.480]   Wait a minute, verse three just said
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.800]   that you will lead me down the right path.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   And now you're saying you're gonna lead me down a path
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.760]   of the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.360]   What's going on here?
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.440]   Why is he doing this?
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.120]   See, that's the problem, right?
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.080]   You see, for us believers, often we think
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.480]   that as soon as we believe in God,
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.240]   our life should be completely blissful and blessed.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.800]   We should be like the poem, "Footprints in the Sand,"
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.080]   just strolling along the beach, enjoying time with God.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:41.760]   But then we look at Jesus and we think,
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.400]   "Oh, actually, no, his life didn't seem
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.480]   "that blissful and blessed."
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.120]   But then why?
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.320]   Why does he lead us down this right path
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.840]   that ends up being the valley of the shadow of death?
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.760]   See, David knew.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.360]   David, as a shepherd, knew that when he was looking
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.880]   after sheep, he would take them to the green pastures,
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.600]   he would take them to the still waters,
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.680]   but to get there, you need to go through the valleys.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.640]   To get there, you need to lead the sheep to the valleys
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.520]   over avalanches, over raging rivers, over rock slides.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.560]   To get there, to get to the places where they could feed,
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.520]   they have to take this treacherous road.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.360]   That is why we need those valleys.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.720]   And sometimes you think, "Oh, that shouldn't be the case.
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.360]   "I wanna stay on the mountaintop.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.520]   "I wanna stay and enjoy the view here forever."
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.880]   But you see, here's the problem.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.880]   Oswald Chambers says this,
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.320]   that mountaintops are only there for inspiration.
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.440]   If there's a mountain, that means there has to be a valley.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.800]   Now, we're not there yet at the end
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.800]   where we can enjoy all of that forever,
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.680]   so we need to keep going.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.000]   And to keep going, we have to go back down,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.160]   and we have to go to these valleys.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.400]   And this is why we need to remember
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.680]   the truth of this chapter,
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.440]   because we need to know that challenges and suffering
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.240]   are a part of the human experience,
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.760]   not apart from the human experience.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.520]   To be human means at some point you have to suffer.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:08.040]   No one here is immortal.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.680]   At some point, we will have to suffer.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.520]   We will have to die.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.000]   And so for us, we would do well to remember
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.200]   that as we go through the challenges of life,
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.400]   that actually our eyes just need to remain on Him,
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.960]   because He will lead us.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.800]   Something else here.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.560]   This valley of the shadow of death, He walks through it.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.840]   This tells me two things.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.320]   Number one, it means we're not trapped there.
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.160]   Do you get it?
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.520]   Sometimes when you're in a troublesome situation
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.240]   or when you're in a challenge,
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.160]   you feel as though, "Oh my goodness, I'm gonna die.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.760]   "This is gonna be forever."
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.640]   Do we feel like that?
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.160]   Sometimes whenever we face these things,
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.560]   we're just wondering, "When is it gonna end?"
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.600]   But we have to remember that these valleys,
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.760]   we will walk through, that it is not the end.
[00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.400]   You have to believe in that cheesy saying,
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.040]   and I'm a kind of cheesy kind of guy,
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   is everything will be okay in the end,
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.720]   and if it's not okay, then it's not the end.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.560]   So therefore you keep walking.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.880]   So you're not trapped there.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.800]   We have to walk through this valley.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.400]   But you also, second point, you also can't run.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:14.000]   Sometimes when we face challenges,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.480]   the first thing we wanna do is get away from it
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.320]   as quick as possible,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.040]   to get through it as quick as possible.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.600]   I do this when I go to the gym.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:24.960]   Christina can go to the gym for two, three hours straight,
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.400]   just constantly going.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.480]   That's why she is like abnormally strong.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.240]   But I like to go to the gym
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.960]   and make sure I've ticked the boxes off as fast as I can,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.320]   and anything more than 20 minutes is too long.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.600]   And then I spend the rest of the time in the jacuzzi,
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:44.960]   where I wait for Christina.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.440]   But sometimes I feel like that.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.800]   Any challenges, actually I'm a guy
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.720]   that's like the path of least resistance.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.600]   So if I'm walking in shops, or walking along the streets,
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.280]   and I see that I can pass through this shop
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.400]   to get some air conditioning, I will go through it.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.720]   I will enjoy the air con,
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.560]   and I will do whatever it takes
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.960]   to make my life as easy as possible.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.320]   That's me.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.000]   But you see, but I'm reminded here
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.400]   that the Christian life is not like that.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.240]   That's not what scripture tells us.
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.520]   That's not the truth.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.760]   There are challenges that we constantly have to face.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:17.800]   So we're not trapped in them,
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.880]   but we also can't run through them.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.600]   We have to walk through this valley.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.480]   See, the word for death here means extreme danger, peril.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.360]   But it's also just a shadow.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.280]   I walked through the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.400]   Someone once said, "I'd much rather be hit
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:39.320]   "by the shadow of a bus than by a bus itself."
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.240]   Shadows are not things that are gonna destroy you.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:46.960]   It was Ruth Renkel that said, "Never fear shadows,
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.880]   "because it only means that there is a light nearby."
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.640]   So we walk through this valley of the shadow of death
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:58.480]   with confidence because we know that He is with us.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.240]   Jesus is saying, John 16, 33,
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.760]   "In this world, you will have trouble,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.640]   "but take heart, I have overcome the world, and follow me.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.520]   "You are with me."
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.440]   Now it's interesting here because David here
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.720]   goes from the third person, the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.440]   He makes me, He leads me, He restores, He leads.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.760]   To now changing in verse four to, "You are with me."
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.840]   He heightens the level of intimacy.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.080]   He's saying that Jesus really is with me.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.040]   "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.840]   Your rod and the staff are two tools
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.760]   that a shepherd would have whilst looking after the sheep
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:37.040]   to protect them, to count them, to guide them,
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.120]   to tell them off, to rebuke them, to rescue them.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.560]   But both tools require close proximity.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.240]   So he's saying, "I won't have to fear
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:50.560]   "as I walk through this because Jesus, you,
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.560]   "my good shepherd, you are with me.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.640]   "And your rod and your staff, they deliver me."
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.920]   No, they help me escape.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:07.160]   No, "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.480]   So we see here, no promise of immunity,
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.880]   no promise of deliverance.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.520]   He's saying that in your trials, in your suffering,
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.400]   whatever you're going through right now,
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.400]   Jesus is with you to comfort you, to get through this.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.720]   And Romans talks about this because it's in the suffering
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.000]   that you will then persevere,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.960]   and then you'll gain character, and then you'll have hope.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.880]   So he is with you.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.240]   And really the crux of this,
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.880]   the key point of this verse is this.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.680]   "Even though I will, even though I walk
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.400]   "through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.360]   "I will fear no evil."
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.040]   That's it.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.880]   If you're gonna, this is my favorite part of sermons
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.720]   that I'm listening to,
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.680]   'cause it's the way the preacher goes.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.560]   If you forget everything else in the sermon, remember this.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.760]   And now you're all paying attention
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.480]   just for another five seconds.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.400]   "Even though I will."
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.360]   I want you to hold onto that.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.280]   I want you to think about your situation.
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.600]   Even though I'm going through this problem at work,
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.160]   even though I'm going through this problem with my marriage,
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.200]   even though my kids are struggling with this,
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.040]   even though the world seems to be falling apart
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.840]   because of a pandemic and politics,
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.480]   even though, even though, even though I'm in a chemo ward,
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.640]   even though I will trust in the Lord.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.040]   I will.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.160]   You have to will yourself to do it.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.680]   You have to remind yourself to do it.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.720]   What is your even though?
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:38.960]   What is your even though I will?
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.560]   Because as I said at the beginning,
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.480]   it's not what happens to you that matters,
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.960]   it's how you respond.
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.920]   So even though you are going through this,
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.320]   the reminder is, but you will do this.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.160]   You will praise the Lord.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.600]   You will trust in God.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.080]   Reminded of in the book of Daniel in the Old Testament,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.760]   Daniel's friends, they were under threat.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:06.120]   They refused to worship this king as their God.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.360]   And so they were getting threatened
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:10.640]   to being thrown into a blazing furnace.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.480]   And what do they say here?
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.240]   Daniel three, I think it's on the slides, verse 17.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:17.360]   They say this, "If we are thrown in the blazing furnace,
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.240]   "the God we serve is able to deliver us from it.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.760]   "And he will deliver us from your majesty's hand."
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.920]   But here's the key.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.040]   But even if he does not, we want you to know your majesty,
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:29.080]   that we will not serve your gods
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.400]   or worship the image of God you have set up.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.360]   Even if God doesn't deliver me from this thing,
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.160]   even if, even though I'm still struggling with this,
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.040]   I will still trust him.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.400]   I will still worship him.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.280]   Again, in the Old Testament, Habakkuk, a minor prophet,
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.720]   during the time where the Israelites
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.080]   were being ruled over by the Babylonians.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.880]   He had this passage that says this,
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.680]   "Though the fig tree should not blossom,
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.840]   "nor fruit beyond the vines,
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.640]   "the produce of the olive fail,
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.240]   "and the fields yield no flock."
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.960]   Basically, if everything goes wrong,
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.160]   "The flock be cut off from the fold,
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.400]   "and there be no herd in the stalls.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.480]   "Yet I will rejoice."
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.360]   Brothers and sisters, that's it.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.680]   If you are able to latch on and understand
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.000]   and believe that mindset of, "Even though I will,"
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.640]   then you can stick to the truth.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.600]   You can remember what the truth is,
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.880]   and you can fight off, you can fend off the enemy's lies.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.280]   I'm reminded of Acts 16, Paul and Silas,
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.840]   they're arrested for spreading the gospel.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.440]   They're beaten.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:29.600]   They are put in prison.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.040]   Acts 16, and what happens?
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:34.040]   They're no doubt lying on the floor in prison.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:34.920]   No doubt, at that point,
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.360]   they could feel sorry for themselves, but they don't.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.880]   What does scripture say they do?
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880]   They're singing praises.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.760]   Can you imagine just lying on a prison cell floor,
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.600]   completely just bleeding?
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.280]   Even though, yet I will.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.320]   Even though I will.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.560]   What's your even though?
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.600]   Verse five, "You prepare a table before me
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.480]   "in the presence of my enemies.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.000]   "You anoint my head with oil, and my cup overflows."
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.200]   The translation of this would be,
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.680]   "And now the challenges I face
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.120]   "are threatening to destroy me and expose me.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.560]   "I have nothing left to give,
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.800]   "and no one coming to my rescue."
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.640]   No one coming to my rescue.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.560]   These enemies, these attackers,
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.160]   no one is gonna be protecting me.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.520]   See, he moves now.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.320]   He's stopped talking about shepherding,
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.280]   and he moves on to hosting.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.760]   And he talks about God inviting him to this table.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.760]   And you see, this is the interesting thing here.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.160]   David's facing all these troubles,
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.320]   and yet what he sees God doing is this.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.640]   In the midst of those challenges,
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.000]   in the midst of those challenges,
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.600]   whatever, however hard life is sucking right now,
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.960]   he sees God telling him, "Sit down."
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.000]   He knows the enemies are right there.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.640]   He knows all the challenges are right there,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.200]   and yet God is saying, "Take a seat."
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.400]   Let me translate that to maybe modern day language,
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.280]   young people language.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.680]   It's God telling all of us, "Hey, eyes on me.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:06.000]   "Hey, eyes on me.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.800]   "Don't worry about them.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.320]   "They'll still be there, but you, eyes on me.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.560]   "Don't be afraid because I am here,
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.360]   "because I have invited you to my table."
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.160]   And in that culture, if you invite someone to your table,
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.360]   that is an honoured guest.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:24.480]   That is someone who is very, very special.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:25.680]   And if they're extra special,
[00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.280]   they get anointed with oil on their head,
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.240]   which is exactly how David describes it.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.560]   So God's looking at you.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.840]   He's looking at me saying, "Hey, sit down.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.960]   "Drop your weapon.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.960]   "Be still.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.520]   "Know who I am.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.240]   "It doesn't matter who they are.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.720]   "In the midst of your challenge at work,
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.040]   "in the midst of your challenge in your family,
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.280]   "in the midst of the chemo ward, sit down.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.240]   "Hey, eyes on me."
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:57.480]   And this cup that overflows symbolises God's provision.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.280]   He's saying, "If I'm with God, if he's my shepherd,
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.040]   "I shall not want.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.680]   "I will be in the green pastures.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.040]   "I will be beside the still waters."
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.320]   So the question here is, again,
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.600]   whatever challenges you're facing,
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.240]   whatever enemies you have,
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.880]   God is telling you, "Hey, eyes on me.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.280]   "Take a seat.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.400]   "You don't have to be afraid."
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   Instead of believing the challenges
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.800]   that are threatening you will destroy and expose you,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.880]   know that I have prepared a table for you
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.280]   in the presence of your enemies
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.640]   because they don't face me at all.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.400]   The goal is for you to keep your eyes on me
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.320]   and your cup will overflow.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.520]   And the final verse,
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.040]   "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.080]   "all the days of my life
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:48.400]   "and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.160]   The word follow there is redap,
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.960]   which actually is stronger than just follow.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.560]   It's pursue, which is why the song that we sang was so good
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.200]   because it's, at the end, goodness of God.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.680]   At the end, it's surely your goodness is running after me.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.440]   That's what it actually means.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.240]   God is running after you.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.960]   You see, the flip, the remixed version of this is,
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.880]   "I can see no end to the sorrow
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.200]   "and grief as my name has only a lifetime of wandering
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.480]   "as it's called.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.960]   "I will die alone and with no peace forgotten."
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.240]   God's saying, "Hey, look at me.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:23.040]   "My goodness and mercy will follow you."
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.280]   It's chasing after you.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.400]   See, David knew about enemies pursuing him.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.040]   He had King Saul chasing him down.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.680]   He had his son chasing him down.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.760]   But he's saying, "None of those matter
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.520]   "if God is chasing me, because God will outrun them.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.320]   "God will overpower them,
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.000]   "because those enemies will be rendered harmless
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.520]   "if God is in pursuit."
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.280]   So let us remember that truth.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.360]   Surely goodness and mercy will follow us
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:50.640]   all the days of our lives,
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.760]   instead of thinking that we will die alone,
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.640]   that we will have no peace,
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:57.760]   that we will be wandering here forever.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:59.440]   You see, the interesting thing about here,
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.520]   and then I'm gonna go into the conclusion, is this.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.080]   We need to remember that God is pursuing us,
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.040]   that God is chasing after us,
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.160]   because often we think we're chasing after God, don't you?
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.200]   Sometimes I do.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.520]   Sometimes I think I'm not a good enough person.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.080]   I need to work harder at being a good person.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.520]   I need to chase after God.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:20.560]   He's just so far, he's just so distant.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.520]   But that's not the gospel.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:22.720]   So, and if you believe that,
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.760]   I can tell you that is the enemy speaking.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:27.960]   That means the enemy has got a seat at the table,
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.200]   because the gospel is this,
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.760]   that God pursues you,
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.840]   that he chases after you.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.680]   How?
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.120]   He left heaven's throne to come to be with you
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:41.240]   in the form of Jesus, to rescue you.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   He is the one who is pursuing you.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:46.480]   And the gospel needs us to remember
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.880]   that we don't need to chase after the approval of man,
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.600]   that we don't need to fear evil,
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.800]   because God himself is following us, is pursuing us.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   So that's it.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.720]   We can put the whole Psalm on there now.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:02.720]   Psalm 23.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.840]   This passage we find is not about funerals.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.000]   It's not about dying.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.800]   It's about living.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.280]   It's about the daily activities that we do,
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.000]   but in a radically transformed, God-centered perspective.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.680]   It changes your approach to how you live.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.480]   It doesn't, of course, it should change your approach
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.360]   about what death is as well.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.000]   But we can see here, this passage, this chapter,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.840]   tells us that in God, we will find peace, not escape.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.920]   In God, we will find contentment, not complacency.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.280]   In God, we find the answers to everything,
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.040]   but the Lord needs to be our shepherd.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.720]   We need to be following Jesus himself,
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.960]   that we shouldn't have to worry,
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.120]   that God himself will protect us.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.000]   He will provide for us.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.680]   How do we know that?
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:54.040]   Because Jesus is the good shepherd,
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.520]   but he also is the sacrificial lamb.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:04.400]   We can trust that he is with us because he's been there,
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.760]   because he himself walked through the valley of death,
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:12.800]   and he destroyed death so that they are just shadows now.
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.000]   So he has put death to death,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.440]   and he's shown us there is something beyond the grave,
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.200]   so we don't need to fear evil.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.280]   And as Chinese people fear death, like no other culture,
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.560]   everything is about death.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.120]   Everything is about death.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:39.680]   And Jesus is saying, "Hey, I defeated death.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.920]   "I walked through the valley of death,
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.720]   "so to you, they are simply shadows,
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:47.800]   "so you won't have to fear."
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.040]   That he resisted the deceiver himself
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.640]   with the word of God, with the truth,
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.880]   and now he becomes our truth.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.080]   And now he can show you the way.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.360]   Now he can give you the abundant life
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.360]   because now he is your way.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.280]   He is the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.040]   Jesus is saying, "Hey, eyes on me, whatever is happening."
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.440]   And he will rescue you from your valley.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:12.400]   Brothers and sisters, I don't know
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.560]   what you're going through.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.160]   I don't know what challenges that you have.
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.040]   Everyone has different kinds of challenges.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:23.800]   But the message I want you to receive and to believe
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.080]   is that God is with you, that Jesus is with you,
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.040]   whatever it is that you're going through,
[00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:32.280]   however bad it is, even to the point
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.040]   of a tortuous death that may await you,
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.760]   Jesus is saying, "I've been there.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.800]   "I have been there and I am with you now.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.920]   "So take heart because I have overcome the world.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:47.840]   "Hey, eyes on me."
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.480]   D.L. Moody has this great quote which says,
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.440]   "Death may be the king of terrors,
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.440]   "but Jesus is the king of kings."
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.680]   Death may be the king of terrors,
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.120]   but Jesus is the king of kings.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:08.040]   So as I show you this "Enemy" remixed version,
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.360]   how many of those verses have you actually let
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.560]   seep into your mind to deceive you?
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.160]   Now, once you've seen the "Enemy" remixed version,
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.640]   something amazing happens.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.240]   When you look back at the real version,
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:24.440]   there is such beauty and encouragement and power in it
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:29.440]   so that you can now say, "Wow, the Lord is my shepherd.
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.800]   "I shall not want."
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.920]   And you can say that, "He leads me beside
[00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.520]   "its green pastures to still waters.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.640]   "He restores your soul.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:44.200]   "He leads you in paths of righteousness for his namesake
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.880]   "because that is who he is."
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:48.000]   And even though you walk through the valley
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.920]   of the shadow of death, you will fear no evil
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.000]   for he is with you because his rod and his staff,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.840]   they comfort you.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.040]   And he prepares a table before you
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.160]   in the presence of your enemies.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.400]   And he anoints your head with oil and your cup overflows.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.880]   So surely goodness and mercy shall follow you
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:07.120]   all the days of your life.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.760]   Do we get that?
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.640]   When you're faced with this "Enemy" version,
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.440]   this deceitful version, and then you compare it
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.120]   to the glorious truth of what he really is,
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.240]   I hope that lifts you.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.000]   I hope that lifts you.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   And I hope that encourages you to keep your eyes up,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.880]   to look to the shepherd.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.720]   I started with a football conversation
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.040]   at the beginning of this.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.960]   And as it's a very special weekend,
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.400]   I wanted to finish with a football conversation.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.320]   As I was walking here to church,
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.640]   I was somehow, I don't know how,
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.040]   I was reminded of the anthem
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.440]   that Liverpool Football Club fans sing.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.520]   And I don't really pay much attention
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.960]   because I'm a bitter, disappointed,
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:53.160]   frustrated football fan.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:59.440]   But I was like, man, what such gospel truth
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:02.560]   in that song, "You'll Never Walk Alone."
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.080]   Such gospel truth.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:08.720]   That whatever you face right now,
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.520]   that you know that you will never walk alone.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:16.160]   Not because of the drunk football fans
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.120]   standing next to you singing this song,
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:22.360]   but because of Jesus.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.360]   Do you get that?
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.560]   That you'll never walk alone because of Jesus.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.000]   And I wanted to just to finish
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.080]   with reading the lyrics to that song.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.240]   I won't sing it to you.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:34.520]   John, you probably know this, right?
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.720]   No, you know this, right?
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.200]   When you walk through a storm,
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   hold your head up high
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.000]   and don't be afraid of the dark.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.600]   At the end of a storm, there's a golden sky
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.160]   and the sweet silver song of a lark.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.800]   Walk on through the wind, walk on through the rain.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.720]   Though your dreams be tossed and blown,
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.560]   walk on, walk on.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:02.360]   With hope in your heart and you'll never walk alone.
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.440]   You'll never walk alone.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.240]   Walk on, walk on.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.880]   With hope in your heart, you'll never walk alone.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:16.120]   That is a Psalm 23 remixed in a beautiful way.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.840]   Let's pray.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:27.440]   Jesus, we believe that you are the good shepherd,
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.400]   that you truly do love us,
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.880]   that you truly do care for us,
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.960]   and that in you, we will have nothing that we need.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.240]   So give us the strength to follow you
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.120]   to these green pastures and to these still waters.
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.480]   Restore our souls,
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.880]   'cause nothing from this world seems enough, ever.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.880]   Lead us on the right path.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.160]   Stop us from getting lost.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:56.560]   And even though we walk through the valley
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.720]   of the shadow of death,
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.480]   keep our eyes fixed on you.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.400]   Give us the strength to lift up our weary heads.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:11.440]   And let us see your loving eyes.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.400]   And let us see and feel your goodness.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.440]   In the presence of our enemies,
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.840]   remind us that you are here.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:22.040]   In the midst of the challenges that we face,
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:26.040]   give us a peace that allows us to drop our weapons,
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.800]   to be still and know that you are God.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:32.760]   And fill us up, Lord,
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.680]   to the point that our cups overflow.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:40.040]   And may your goodness and mercy follow us
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.120]   all the days of our lives.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.080]   And we thank you.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:51.120]   That we will never walk alone,
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.360]   because you never let go.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.280]   Amen.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
