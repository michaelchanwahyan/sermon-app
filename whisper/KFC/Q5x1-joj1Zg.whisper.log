[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   Happy Chinese New Year!
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.760]   Happy Chinese New Year!
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.600]   Everybody have a big dinner to go to tonight?
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.640]   Okay, that's good.
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.200]   We've been working on this series, Equipping the Saints, Serving the Community.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.760]   And I don't know if you know, but just to remind you that our church is looking to serve
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.760]   the community.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.680]   We're looking to go and go to the south side of Hong Kong and possibly see if we can serve
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.880]   the community there, build a community centre there, and reach out to the people there.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.720]   There are a lot of needs, actually, in the south side of Hong Kong.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.520]   And we're working on this theme, Equipping the Saints, Serving the Community.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.640]   Pastor Seth Kim talked about unity last week.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.920]   And let's remind ourselves of this verse last week.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.840]   And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds, and teachers to
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.860]   equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ.
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.160]   And Pastor Seth Kim talked about unity, the importance of unity when we're serving together
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.880]   as the body of Christ.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.040]   Today we're talking about being prepared.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.320]   Prepared.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.120]   We gotta be prepared before we become equipped.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.480]   And so, is there sort of a wind sound?
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.480]   No?
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.480]   It's okay?
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.480]   All right.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.480]   Is it my breath?
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.480]   Okay.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.920]   All right.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.120]   Today we're talking about the passage where Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.920]   by the devil.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.680]   Now, before Jesus was led into the wilderness, do you know what happened?
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.280]   What significant event happened before that?
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.240]   The baptism, right?
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.280]   Jesus was baptized in the Jordan by John the Baptist.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.200]   He was like, "No, no, you baptize me.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.600]   No, no, you baptize me.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.400]   No, no, no, you baptize me."
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.000]   It's like our Chinese dinners where our parents are fighting over the bill, right?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.840]   And Jesus is like, "No, I will be baptized by you, John the Baptist."
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.200]   And there the Father gave his confirmation.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.120]   "You are my son whom I love.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.160]   With you I am well pleased."
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.480]   And then the Holy Spirit came upon him like a dove.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.800]   This is one of the first symbols of the Trinity we see, right?
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.040]   One of the most significant symbols of the Trinity that we see.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.800]   So Jesus was anointed.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   And then soon after, he was led by the Spirit to this desert.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.840]   Now I don't know if Winnie and the team, they went to the Judean desert.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   Did you guys, Winnie, did you go to the desert where Jesus was tempted?
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.840]   Yes?
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.840]   Yeah?
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.360]   So if you see in the next slide, the Judean desert is actually quite near Jerusalem.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.640]   It's right by the Dead Sea.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.560]   And there's actually not much there.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.560]   It's just like this picture, just a bunch of rocks, not many animals or any animals
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.880]   live there, probably just some scorpions and snakes and creepy crawlers.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   And so we see this big contrast from the baptism of Jesus towards the temptation of Jesus.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:49.520]   The baptism of Jesus was in calm waters, calm and cool waters of the Jordan.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.960]   And now Jesus has been led to the barren wilderness, the desert full of rocks.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.400]   There was nothing there.
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.600]   There was only silence and solitude there compared to the big crowds.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.160]   John the Baptist and all his followers were there.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.680]   There was a big crowd at the Jordan River.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.840]   At the Jordan River, the Spirit rested upon him.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.600]   The Father's confirmation was upon him.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.080]   But as soon after, the Spirit leads him.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.120]   And it is not the Father's confirmation, but it is Satan's tempting that we see.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.320]   At the baptism, he was anointed.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.720]   He was baptized in water.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.600]   And in the wilderness, he was attacked.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.280]   And there is the fire of temptation.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.440]   At the baptism, the heavens opened up.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.240]   But in the wilderness, it was like hell.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.200]   It was like hell.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.240]   And so it begs the question, why does Jesus need to be tested?
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.280]   Why does Jesus need to be tested?
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.880]   Well, see, we read here in Hebrews chapter four, "For we do not have a high priest
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.000]   who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.280]   but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.520]   And yet he is without sin."
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.000]   So Jesus was tempted.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.440]   He was tested.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:34.280]   And that is because he is 100% God, and yet he is also 100% man, human.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.440]   And humans, we as humans, we have weaknesses, right?
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.440]   And so we have different temptations.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.680]   And Jesus was also tempted.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:49.120]   But it says here in Scripture that he was tempted, but yet he is without sin,
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.520]   because he is 100% God.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.920]   He is almighty God.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.720]   And we see this pattern of testing within the Bible, okay?
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   What are some things, some people that we see in the Bible that were also tested?
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.440]   What are some people that we see?
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.320]   Pardon me?
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.280]   Yell it out loud.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.800]   King David.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.320]   Yes, King David was tested with many wives.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.200]   (laughs)
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.120]   Many wives, yes.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.640]   Many wives.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:29.640]   Somebody that was tested in the Old Testament, somebody with a son, Abraham, right?
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.800]   How was he tested?
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:38.280]   He was led up to the mountain with his son, and God was testing him.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:45.000]   Do you love your son, who you haven't been able to have a son for so long?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.840]   He was like 100 when he had a son.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.160]   And having a son was so important, right, for his lineage, right?
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.040]   Us as Chinese people also, right?
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.760]   You wanna have your last name to carry on.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.320]   And so Abraham was tested by the Lord.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.600]   Do you love this son more than me, right?
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:17.120]   And then the father, God the father stopped him just before he was about
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.840]   to kill his son, to offer his son.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:28.080]   And in place, God sent a lamb, symbolic, foreshadowing what would come.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.640]   Another person that was tested, a person that went through great struggle,
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.880]   who was he?
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.320]   Great struggle.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.560]   Job.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.040]   God and the devil were talking, right?
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.960]   They were like, "Ah," God was like, "Have you seen my servant Job?
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.320]   He's so awesome.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.440]   He's so awesome."
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:59.560]   And Satan's like, "He's only awesome because you have blessed him with so much.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.360]   Let me test him a bit.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.160]   Let's see if he's still loyal to you."
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.480]   And we see here his three friends saying, "You know, just deny God, you know,
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.960]   deny God, curse God and die."
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.400]   His wife is like, "Curse God and die," right?
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.640]   It's just like, God has done this to you, right?
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.800]   Because you've done something wrong.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.240]   And Job stayed faithful to the Lord.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.080]   He's like, "No, I have not disappointed the Lord.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.840]   I've stayed faithful to the Lord."
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:37.560]   And he passed the test, the test of these boils.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.480]   His family dying, all his possessions being taken away.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.960]   And yet he passed the test.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.280]   He passed the test.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:54.680]   And so we here, we see today, we're going to look into three tests
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.880]   that Jesus went through.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:04.400]   The first test is the test of our flesh, hedonism.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.160]   The second is the test of our eyes, materialism.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:15.360]   And thirdly is the test of our pride, egoism.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.280]   And so Bonnie read wonderfully for us.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.200]   And I'm just going to reread it just quickly.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:28.360]   "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to bread."
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.720]   Right? Jesus was in the desert.
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.880]   He had nothing to eat those days for 40 days.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.960]   And it says here clearly in the Bible that after these 40 days,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.440]   he was hungry.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.360]   Who's hungry?
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.880]   Are you guys being tempted?
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:51.240]   Who's thinking about food and not the Word of God right now?
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:58.520]   And in the same way, Satan was like, "Well, if you are the Son of God,
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.160]   command these stones to become bread."
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.320]   It's very funny. Satan uses, twists these words, right?
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.120]   "If you are the Son of God."
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:15.560]   Now, could Jesus be hungry?
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.160]   Yes, of course, right?
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:23.920]   Because we said once again that Jesus is 100% man and 100% flesh.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.920]   Yes, he is hungry.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:32.920]   And Satan says this, "If you are the Son of God,
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.120]   why do you need to go through this?
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.720]   Why do you need to stay hungry?"
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.920]   Satan is telling Jesus, "You can just pass through this trial.
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.720]   You can skip this trial."
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.320]   Right?
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:53.920]   And it's funny because in the baptism, God, the Father,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.120]   fully confirms that he is who?
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:03.720]   He is the Son who is loved by God,
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:09.120]   who is pleased by God.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.120]   And yet, Satan twists it and says, "If you are the Son of God,
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.520]   turn these stones to bread."
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:26.320]   Satan challenges Jesus to satisfy his flesh in an illegitimate way.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   Because God's will, God the Father's will,
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.720]   was for him to go through these tests.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.320]   Satan is tempting him for his flesh.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.120]   He's hungry to skip these tests, to go against the God's will,
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.320]   God the Father's will, to skip these tests
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.520]   by turning these stones into bread.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.120]   And what does Jesus say in response?
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:56.120]   Jesus says, "Man shall not live by Big Mac alone."
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:00.120]   I mean stone alone, stone alone.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.120]   "Man shall not live by stone, by bread alone."
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   Sorry.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.120]   By bread alone.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.920]   What about us today?
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.720]   What about our society?
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.920]   What about our society today?
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   Are we tempted by the flesh?
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.720]   Hedonism, it means we do whatever we want.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.520]   Pleasure is the most important thing.
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.720]   The desire for pleasure.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.920]   In our world, I would say lust is at its greatest.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.120]   Do you know how much money the porn industry is worth?
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.920]   $97 billion.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.920]   We are obsessed with porn.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.720]   I mean, yesterday we were watching the Australian Open
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.120]   and we were commenting at what somebody was wearing.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.520]   She was wearing something that was so revealing,
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.320]   we were shocked.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   She was playing tennis in something that's very revealing.
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:10.320]   And what we're saying here is our world is now obsessed with it.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.120]   Lust, we see it in our movies.
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:16.520]   Within, you know, a couple minutes, you see these scenes,
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.320]   these sex scenes in the movies, in our TV shows,
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.720]   in our advertisement.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:28.920]   Everything is pointing towards the craving towards our lust.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.720]   Lust is such a big problem.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.120]   Gluttony is such a big problem.
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.920]   I was listening to a podcast recently by a US Marine.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:47.120]   And he's like, "It's so hard to recruit people nowadays.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.120]   Everybody is out of weight."
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.720]   Not out of weight, overweight.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.520]   Not awful.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.920]   Everybody's overweight and eating junk food.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.320]   And it's so hard for the army to recruit people.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.720]   People are unfit and they're just at home
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.920]   playing video games or watching Netflix.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.320]   It's such a big problem for the army.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.920]   Gluttony is such a big problem.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.320]   And let's be honest, these are some of the wealthiest times
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.520]   we've ever had in the history of humanity.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.320]   We have so much food.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.520]   We can get any food we want at any time almost.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.720]   We have become the master of our stomachs.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.120]   I'm guilty as charged. I love to eat.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.120]   Who loves to eat?
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.920]   Yeah, we love to eat.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.720]   And we've become very lazy people.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.720]   Just sit at home and order everything.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.120]   You can order anything online.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.320]   Things are so convenient that we've become so lazy.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.120]   Especially this new generation.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.720]   The work ethic's not there anymore.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.520]   I coach some of them and they expect things to be there right away.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.520]   But it takes work. It takes time.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.920]   But we've become so slothful.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.520]   I don't know if that's a word, slothful.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:17.320]   But yeah, our flesh, hedonism, lust, gluttony, sloth, wrath.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:23.920]   These are all things that we still deal with today in a big way.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.120]   The testing of our flesh.
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.720]   Let's look at the second test, the test of our eyes.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.120]   I'm not putting an eye test up, don't worry.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.920]   To see if you can see the words.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.320]   But I will see if you can read with me.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.920]   Let's read together the second test, verse 5.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.520]   1, 2, 3.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.320]   "And the devil took up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.320]   in a moment of time." Is it an eye test?
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.520]   Let's continue reading. 1, 2, 3.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:59.120]   "And said to him, 'To you I will give all this authority and their glory,
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.520]   For you then will worship me, it will all be yours.'
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.320]   And Jesus answered him, 'It is written,
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:18.720]   "You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve."'"
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:24.320]   The second test is the test of our eyes.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.720]   When we walk through the mall today,
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:33.320]   when we walk through the streets of Hong Kong with all the advertisements,
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.520]   when we see it, we want it.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:41.720]   Right? When we walk through that shoe store,
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   and we see this new pair of shoe that has just come out,
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.520]   we see it and we're like, "Wow!"
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.120]   It would look so nice on me.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:56.320]   Or it would be so nice to play in these shoes.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:02.920]   Or we look and see these clothes, and we're like, "Wow! It would look so nice on me."
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   Fight Club has this quote,
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:13.120]   "Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes and working jobs we hate,
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.720]   so we buy stuff we don't need."
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.120]   Isn't that so true?
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.120]   There's so much advertising out there.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.120]   Advertising knows that if we see it and it looks appealing,
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.320]   we're gonna want it. We're gonna want it.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.120]   That's why we're chasing cars and clothes and working jobs we hate,
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.720]   so we buy stuff we don't need.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:47.320]   It's the same today, and it was the same in the time of Eve.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.520]   Eve was presented with this fruit.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.520]   It looked so nice.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:18:00.520]   Satan says, "Did God really say you shouldn't eat from this tree?
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.720]   Look how nice this fruit is."
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.120]   When the woman saw that the fruit of this tree was good for food
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:16.320]   and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom,
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:21.920]   she took some and ate it.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:27.520]   She took some and ate it because it was pleasing to the eye.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.720]   Pleasing to the eye.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:39.120]   We desire so much material wealth nowadays.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.920]   You know, there's a stat within these couple years.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.120]   The richest 10% of the global population currently takes home
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:55.120]   - do you know how much percent of the global wealth?
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:58.920]   52% of the global wealth.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:04.920]   10% take home 50% of the global wealth.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:16.120]   The poorest of the 10% earn 8% of the global wealth.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:23.720]   Greed and envy are such huge issues.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.320]   And we see it in Hong Kong, don't we?
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.120]   People with their fancy cars and Rolexes.
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.520]   Charles mentioned Rolex last time.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.720]   I remember.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   We always compare. We always envy.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.520]   We see somebody else has it and we're like, "How come I don't have it?
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.520]   I want that."
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:50.520]   The test of our eyes. Materialism.
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.520]   And what was Jesus' response?
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   Jesus' response was, "Yes, you currently - Satan, yes,
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.920]   currently Satan owns this material world.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.720]   He doesn't fight against him."
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.920]   Jesus didn't say, "No, ultimately it will come back to me.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.920]   I will make everything new."
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.320]   Jesus doesn't argue with the devil here.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.520]   Right?
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.920]   And Jesus is being tempted.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   He's seeing all the kingdoms and authorities of the world.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:30.120]   And yet, he responds to Satan and says, "You shall worship the Lord your God
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   and you shall serve him only."
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.320]   The test of our flesh.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.520]   The test of our eyes.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:46.120]   And finally, we have the test of our pride.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.520]   Let's read together one more time.
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.320]   Verse 9.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:57.720]   One, two, three. "And he took him to Jerusalem and set him on the pinnacle."
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.120]   Is it the pinnacle? Sorry.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.320]   "On the highest point of the temple.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:07.720]   'If you are the son of God,' he said, 'throw yourself down from here.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   For it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.720]   to guard you carefully.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.520]   They will lift you up in their hands so that you will surely
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.120]   not strike your foot against a stone.'
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:26.520]   Jesus answered, 'It is said, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   When the devil had finished all this tempting,
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.520]   he left him until an opportune time.'"
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:39.520]   Jesus was taken to the highest point of the temple
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.520]   or the pinnacle.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.520]   And that is this point in Jerusalem.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:49.520]   And this point would have been the busiest place in the city.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.320]   There's a lot of people, right?
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.720]   A lot of people coming into the temple,
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.520]   worshiping God, coming out of the temple.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:02.520]   And Jesus is being told, "Throw yourself down from here."
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.920]   Right? And what will happen?
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.320]   It says in Psalms, according to Psalms, right?
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.920]   The angels will catch you.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.320]   Why does Satan say this?
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:17.520]   What is Satan testing here?
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.920]   Satan is saying to Jesus,
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.920]   "You don't have to endure the cross.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.320]   This cross is so painful.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:34.020]   The nails in your hands, the humiliation, being naked,
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.920]   nailed onto a cross, hung onto a cross,
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.120]   naked, crown of thorns on your head.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.720]   You can skip all this.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.320]   You can skip the will of the Father.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.720]   You can do something that is easier.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.920]   Just throw yourself from the temple.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.020]   Everybody will say, "Wow, you are great.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:59.320]   You are amazing."
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.820]   And they'll see that you are the Savior.
[00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:08.220]   Satan was testing Jesus to go against
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.420]   the Father.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.020]   He's going against the Father.
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:19.820]   This is the final test, the test of our pride.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.820]   What is pride?
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.820]   Pride
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:31.720]   is believing that we know what's best,
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.820]   inflating our one self.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   Jesus is being tempted here in His pride to say,
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.220]   "You can go against the Father.
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.720]   You can do something better, easier."
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.120]   And that is why Satan tempted Him here.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:57.620]   Eve was also tempted in her pride.
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:05.520]   The devil said, "For God knows that when you eat of this,
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.620]   your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God,
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.620]   knowing good and evil.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:19.920]   Eat this apple, and you will be as good as God,
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.220]   as great as God, knowing good and evil."
[00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:28.420]   The test of pride.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.620]   And we see that nowadays so much,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.020]   especially in this postmodern world.
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.620]   It's not about truth anymore.
[00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.320]   It's about what you believe is right.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.220]   What you believe is right.
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:55.120]   I was having a conversation with some of our youngsters recently,
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.920]   and we were having some debate, you know, some good spiritual conversation
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:02.020]   about whether the Bible is actually true or not,
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.820]   or whether it's written by God or not.
[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.920]   And this student was very convinced,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.320]   was not convinced that the Bible was from God,
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.720]   that the prophecies of God are true.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.120]   And I was like, "You know what?
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.120]   You can take a look at some of these facts from this one book.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.620]   It's called 'The Case of Christ,' right?
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:26.520]   'The Case for Christ.'
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.520]   It lays down a lot of significant evidence that the Bible is real.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.020]   There's a series of them, right?
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.620]   'The Case for Christ,' 'The Case of Faith,' 'The Christ.'
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.620]   Yeah, it explains some of these things."
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.920]   And he was like, "Oh, I don't want to read it.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.420]   I don't want to read it. All these things are biased."
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   And I'm like, "Well, why don't you just take a look
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:54.120]   at some of the arguments that he's presenting,
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.820]   and maybe they'll start to make sense to you."
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.720]   And he's like, "No, I don't want to read it. It's bias."
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.020]   And I'm like, "Okay.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.320]   Well, how are you going to learn the truth then?"
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:12.920]   He's like, "I don't know. I'll just do it on my own.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.420]   I believe in myself."
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:20.720]   And isn't that what our world is now?
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.220]   It doesn't matter if there's truth.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:30.520]   What most matters is what I believe, what's right for me.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:34.720]   I think this is right.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:37.120]   It doesn't matter what God thinks.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.520]   I believe this is right.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.720]   This is our pride talking.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:49.020]   We believe that we are more right than the moral law maker.
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:57.120]   This is the test of our pride.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.120]   And what was Jesus' response?
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.820]   "You shall not put the Lord your God to the test."
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:10.020]   You shall not put the Lord God to the test.
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:15.320]   Because He is all-knowing, all-powerful.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.520]   Why are we testing God?
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:23.020]   God, we should be trusting Him instead of testing Him.
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.520]   Place our full faith in Him.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.120]   He's almighty, all-knowing.
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:31.620]   And He loves us.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:37.120]   But yet we test Him instead of trusting in Him.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.320]   So what were the three tests?
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:47.020]   The first was the test of the flesh, hedonism.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.220]   Pleasure is king.
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.420]   The second was the test of our eyes.
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:58.720]   We see and we want it, materialism.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.820]   And lastly, the test of our pride, egoism.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.320]   We believe we know what is best.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.520]   We believe we know what is right.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.120]   God doesn't matter.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   The three tests that Jesus was put through
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:22.620]   in order to prepare Him for ministry.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:29.520]   And so, we are also being tested.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.520]   God also is testing us.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:39.720]   And in order to pass the tests, we need to know our enemy.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.020]   What is some common things that we see from the enemy, from Satan?
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:48.720]   The Bible says Satan was once the morning star, right?
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:53.020]   He was Lucifer, one of the top three generals, right?
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.520]   There was Michael, Gabriel, and Lucifer.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.820]   And Lucifer thought he was so beautiful
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.420]   that he was greater and better than God.
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:09.320]   And so, he and his legion of angels was sent down to the earth.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.720]   And that is why we have demons.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.520]   And Satan is the leader of them.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.320]   And so, in order to defeat these tests or pass these tests,
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.720]   we need to know our enemy.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.320]   And the first thing we know from this story
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.220]   is that Satan comes at an opportune time.
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:36.120]   He came when Jesus was tired, hungry.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:38.520]   He comes when we are weak.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:42.520]   In our weakness, Satan comes at an opportune time.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:47.820]   He's looking. He's like the lion, ready to pounce.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:55.020]   The second thing we see here that Satan is,
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.720]   he questions the truth.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:04.520]   Did God really say you shouldn't eat from all the trees?
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:11.220]   If you are the son of God,
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:17.720]   he's questioning, making us question the truth.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.520]   What God really said.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.920]   The third thing we need to know about our enemy
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.320]   is he knows how to twist scripture for his purposes.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:30.420]   Satan knows the Bible, right? He knows the Bible.
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:35.820]   And so, we need to know the Bible better, right?
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.320]   Or else, we're gonna be tricked.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.120]   Satan pulled up a verse here, right?
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.620]   "For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you."
[00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:50.120]   And he sort of misses the next part,
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.620]   which is, "In all your ways."
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:58.420]   Satan is focusing on only one aspect of scripture,
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.920]   but not the part that is important.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:07.520]   He will guard you, sort of, in your ways,
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:11.420]   that is, in God's ways.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:15.420]   In the way of God, in God's will.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.220]   Satan skips that out,
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.820]   so that he can just focus on the things that he wants.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.620]   So, we need to be careful of Satan,
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.420]   when we are weak,
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.220]   when we are being questioned of our identity
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.920]   and God's love for us, our identity in Christ.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.420]   We need to be careful.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.720]   To know scripture more,
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:46.320]   so that devil doesn't twist these scriptures against us.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.920]   And we need to know our Messiah.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.520]   How did he overcome these tests?
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:56.320]   He knows scripture better, right?
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:01.620]   It says, "Don't put the Lord God to the test."
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.520]   He knows scripture better. He is God.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.720]   He didn't argue with the devil, right?
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.420]   There's no sense arguing with the devil sometimes.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:15.020]   We just need to know what scripture is,
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:18.220]   and then just flee, right?
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.520]   He knew what was righteous and the Father's will.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:24.120]   He knew what was the Father's will.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.020]   The Father's will was for him to go through these tests,
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.520]   not skip.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.620]   Skip by turning these stones into bread.
[00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.920]   He knew the Father's will.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.320]   What was the Father's will?
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.320]   Was for him to die for the sins of humanity.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.320]   Not to skip this test by showing how great and how awesome he is,
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.620]   so that he can get off easy.
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:48.720]   He knew the Father's will,
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:53.520]   and because he did, he was able to pass these tests.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:33:02.920]   And he was able to stand firm and maintain his integrity.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.220]   And we need to be like Christ.
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:11.020]   We need to be like Christ.
[00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:19.320]   Adam died and had sin.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:25.220]   Jesus did not die to prove he is God,
[00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.020]   and he overcame sin.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:33.220]   With Adam came judgment and condemnation because of sin,
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:37.320]   but with Jesus came justification.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.120]   With Adam came death,
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.820]   but with Jesus, he overcame death.
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:50.120]   Through Adam, we were made sinners,
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:55.420]   but through Jesus, we are made righteous.
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.320]   We are made righteous.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.220]   Yes, Jesus was tempted,
[00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:06.020]   but yet he is without sin.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.420]   Have you guys watched the Olympics?
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:10.520]   And you know the deadlift?
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.120]   The deadlift is like this, right?
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.220]   You're on your knees—
[00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:17.820]   You're not on your knees. You're bending your knees.
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.520]   Sorry. Sorry. English is my second language.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.220]   Yeah, I grew up in Hong Kong. Cantonese was my first language.
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.520]   So you're on your—you're bending your knees.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.020]   See, I almost did it again.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.820]   And then you're flipping this.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.320]   I don't know how many kg it is.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.120]   How many kg do you think it is?
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.720]   Who lifts weights here?
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.820]   Carlos, you used to weightlift. How many kg is this?
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.320]   145 times 3, right?
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:50.620]   How much is that? A lot.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.720]   So you're lifting it, right?
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.620]   And then you're lifting it over your shoulder,
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.320]   and you have to, like, make the stance, you know,
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.920]   so that you can hold it.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.920]   How long are you supposed to hold it for? I don't know.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.720]   They hold it for as long as they can, right?
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.120]   To prove that they fully hold the weight.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.320]   Temptation is like this.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.420]   We're trying to lift this temptation,
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:21.520]   and it comes, and it's so heavy that we give in to it.
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.820]   And when we give in to it, what happens? We drop it.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.320]   All right?
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:36.020]   But Jesus took this 45 times 3 times 6 over his shoulder,
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:42.620]   stood it up, and what happened when temptation and tepsting came?
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:47.620]   He stood firm. He stood firm.
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.120]   He didn't drop it.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.020]   He didn't drop these weights,
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.720]   because He is God Almighty.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.920]   We have a Savior who went through the tests that we go through.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.020]   The temptation of our flesh, the temptation of our eyes,
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:10.720]   the temptation of pride, and yet He is without sin.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.320]   He's the only one on this earth, not Muhammad, not Buddha,
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.820]   not Gandhi, only Jesus Christ.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.920]   And that is why we are here worshiping the Lord today,
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:27.720]   because our God lives, overcame temptation, overcame death.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.720]   He is the only one that can lift this weight.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.020]   Amen. Hallelujah.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:42.120]   And this is the Father's will.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.720]   Jesus said this, "I am the true vine."
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.720]   Let's read together. One, two, three.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.720]   "I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener.
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.020]   He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit,
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.620]   while every branch that does bear fruit,
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:04.320]   He prunes so that it will be even more fruitful."
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:11.420]   Jesus died and rose again because He wants us to be fruitful.
[00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.020]   To bear fruit.
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.720]   Not so we could eat it ourselves.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:20.520]   He doesn't bless us so we can enjoy the blessings for ourselves.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.620]   He blesses us so that we can bless others.
[00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.820]   He wants us to be fruitful.
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.720]   And in order to be fruitful, we must first be prepared.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:35.720]   He needs to cut off the lust of our flesh, our hedonism.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.220]   He needs to cut off the lust of our eyes, materialism.
[00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.820]   He needs to cut off the pride of our life, egoism,
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:47.520]   so that He can make us more fruitful.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:52.620]   That we could be equipped to serve the community.
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:57.020]   To expand His kingdom.
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:05.520]   And so, what does the Father need to cut off from you
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.220]   to make you more fruitful?
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:17.920]   What does the Father need to cut off of you,
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.820]   from you, to make you more fruitful?
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.720]   What temptation, what test are you struggling through
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.820]   that is holding you back from serving the Lord,
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:39.220]   reaching your full potential to bear more fruit?
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:47.320]   God wants to prepare you for His purposes.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:53.320]   As the band comes up, I'm gonna give us six R's.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:39:01.320]   The six R's to reaching our potential and overcoming tests.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.920]   The first R is recognize.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.320]   Recognize your weaknesses.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.120]   If you don't believe that you have any weaknesses,
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.820]   you won't change.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.720]   Right? I teach some students.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.620]   They think they're great.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.520]   Well, then there's nothing to teach.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   You teach me. You're so great.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.620]   If you don't recognize the weaknesses that you are going through,
[00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:37.720]   then you won't change.
[00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:39.120]   We're all weak.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:43.020]   We all have things that we need to overcome.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.920]   The second thing is we need to repent of these weaknesses,
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.620]   present to them, present them before the Lord and confess them
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.020]   and say, "I agree with you, Lord, that I've gone my own way.
[00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:56.420]   I struggle with my flesh.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.820]   I struggle with materialism.
[00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.820]   I struggle with my pride."
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.820]   I repent them before you.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:06.720]   The next is reconcile.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.220]   Repair that relationship with the Lord through repentance.
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.020]   And then next, what do we need to do?
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.720]   We need to recite.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.420]   What do we need to recite?
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:21.420]   Recite the Word of the Lord.
[00:40:21.420 --> 00:40:24.420]   Satan knows Scripture.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:32.020]   And if he knows it better than us, we're going to be in trouble.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:37.120]   That's why Jesus has sent who?
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:40.520]   To teach us, to guide us, to lead us.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.420]   Who has Jesus sent?
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:47.220]   The Holy Spirit to teach us the Word of God.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:47.920]   Right?
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.420]   That's why we need to recite the Word of God so that the Holy Spirit
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:56.120]   will open our eyes so that we can see the truth.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.420]   Next is we need to take responsibility.
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:03.320]   Responsibility for our actions.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:08.920]   If we know that we're tempted in a certain situation, we need to get out of it.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.120]   We need to take responsibility.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:13.120]   Avoid those certain areas.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:17.820]   Don't go to the mall if you're going to shop.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:23.920]   Don't go on that website if you know you're going to buy things you don't need.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.620]   Take responsibility.
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:32.320]   And the last thing is we need to reach out.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:40.220]   If we could do it alone, we would have done it already.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:46.720]   This is from some weight-losing advertisement, okay?
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:48.820]   In Canada.
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:53.620]   If you could do it alone, you would have done it already.
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:58.020]   It's from some weight-losing, all right, company.
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.720]   And it's true.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:04.720]   If we could do it alone, we would have done it already.
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   God has placed us in community, in fellowship, so that we could bear each other's burdens,
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:18.820]   so we can pray for one another and be healed according to James.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:29.020]   God has placed us so that we can reach out to others and bear each other's burdens.
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:37.420]   Let us take a moment to just close our eyes and come before the Lord.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.920]   Just you and Him right now.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.720]   You and the Lord right now.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:48.820]   You and the Lord.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.120]   Let's do one or two of these steps.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:59.620]   Maybe we just need to come and repent before the Lord.
[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:10.120]   Maybe we need to come and recognize, "God, open our eyes to our own weaknesses."
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:19.920]   Maybe the Lord is telling us we need to be renewed as we recite the Word of God.
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:28.720]   Maybe the Lord is telling us we need to reach out.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.620]   We are weak.
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:41.920]   We need to reach out to somebody that is close, trusted, that we can bear each other's burdens.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.420]   Let's just take a moment before the Lord.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:44:15.220]   [music]
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:18.720]   Heavenly Father, we come before you.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:24.220]   We just want to admit life is hard.
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.720]   Life is a struggle.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.220]   There are so many tests and so many temptations.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:34.520]   It's so hard sometimes.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.620]   We just come honestly and openly before you.
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:46.620]   We ask that the Holy Spirit would come, convict us of our sins.
[00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:56.320]   The Holy Spirit would come, open our eyes to the truth, to sanctify our hearts, to make
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:04.620]   us more like Christ, that we could be equipped to serve you.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.920]   Father, help us in our weaknesses.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.520]   Be our strength.
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.520]   In Jesus' name we pray.
