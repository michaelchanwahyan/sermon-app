[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]  (字幕製作:貝爾)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.240]  好,今日我們的主題是He is Risen
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.240]  我們說He is Risen之前
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.920]  你有沒有聽過有很多不同的理論
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.920]  有些隱秘理論
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.920]  195年
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.680]  那些人
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.480]  你看外面
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.480]  看不到
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.480]  在
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.480]  在哪裡看
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.960]  森林
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960]  或者是地球
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.960]  他就看不到地球的盡頭
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.960]  是不是?
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.960]  有些人就叫做
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.960]  Flat Earth People
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.960]  他們覺得世界不是圓的
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.960]  他們覺得是平的
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.960]  因為他們看不到地球的盡頭
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.960]  他們覺得你走了很久
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.960]  然後又會怎樣
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.960]  會掉下去
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.960]  Flat Earth People
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.960]  因為他們相信地球是平的
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.960]  沒有飛過
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.960]  有一個球星很出名
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.960]  相信Flat Earth
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.960]  知道是誰嗎?
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960]  Kyrie Irving
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.960]  她是相信Flat Earth的
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.960]  如果你上過飛機
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960]  你應該看到
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.960]  看起來是圓的
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.960]  第二個隱秘理論
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.960]  是Moon Landing
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960]  有沒有聽過Moon Landing
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.960]  他們好像1960年
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.960]  1960年
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.960]  上了月亮
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.960]  但為什麼
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960]  從現在到那時
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.960]  從過去
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.960]  為什麼還沒有回到月亮
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.960]  有些人就覺得
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960]  可能用Hollywood的電影
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.960]  偽造了月亮的落地
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.960]  還有一個隱秘理論
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.960]  有聽過5G的隱秘理論嗎?
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.960]  5G的隱秘理論
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960]  有沒有人聽過?
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.960]  5G
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960]  有些人覺得
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.960]  他們放了很多5G
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.960]  你的電話有沒有5G?
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.960]  哪有5G的電話?
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960]  他們以前
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.960]  不知道現在有沒有
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.960]  他們覺得放了很多5G Tower
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.960]  全部人的免疫系統
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.960]  就弱了
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.960]  弱了
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.960]  接著他們就受了COVID
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.960]  有沒有聽過?
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.960]  有沒有聽過這個隱秘理論?
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.960]  還有些人就覺得
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.960]  COVID的疫苗是給你COVID的
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.960]  有些人覺得
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.960]  COVID的疫苗你放了
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.960]  政府就可以追蹤你的系統
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.960]  你的身體
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.960]  有沒有人聽過這個隱秘理論?
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.960]  很多不同的隱秘理論
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.960]  我們今天說耶穌
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.960]  耶穌復活
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960]  耶穌復活
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.960]  都有很多不同的隱秘理論
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960]  有沒有聽過?
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.960]  耶穌復活的不同的隱秘理論
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:01.960]  有沒有人聽過?
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960]  OK
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.960]  有很多不同的隱秘理論
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.960]  我們今天會說4個不同的隱秘理論
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.960]  第一是叫
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.960]  The Swoon Theory
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960]  第二是
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.960]  Conspiracy Theory
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.960]  第三是
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.960]  Hallucination Theory
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.960]  第四是
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.960]  Myth Theory
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.960]  我們在說這些不同的隱秘理論之前
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.960]  我們先說說
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.960]  神話是說什麼的
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.960]  我們一起讀
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.960]  Luke 24
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.960]  一起讀
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.960]  1,2,3
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.960]  在星期一的第一天
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.960]  早上
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.960]  女人拿著她準備的香料
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.960]  前往寺廟
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.960]  她們發現石頭
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.960]  從寺廟中滑落
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.960]  但當她們進入
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.960]  她們卻找不到
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.960]  神父的身體
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.960]  她們在想這件事的時候
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.960]  突然
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.960]  兩位穿著光明閃耀的男人
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.960]  站在她們面前
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.960]  她們的驚慌中
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:02.960]  女人向地面向下仰
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.960]  她們的臉向地面向下
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.960]  但男人對她們說
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.960]  為什麼你們要
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.960]  為死亡中的生命著想
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.960]  祂不在
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.960]  祂已經出生
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.960]  記得祂對你們說過什麼
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.960]  祂還在你身邊
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.960]  在加勒比
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.960]  人的兒子
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.960]  必須被傳送到
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.960]  罪惡的手中
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]  被祭祀
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.960]  在第三天
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960]  再次出生
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.960]  然後她們記得了
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.960]  祂的話
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.960]  好
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960]  這個Luke
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.960]  The Gospel of Luke
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.960]  是很清楚
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.960]  說耶穌是怎樣
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960]  是死了
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.960]  第三天是復活的
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.960]  OK
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.960]  但有不同的理論
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960]  第一個理論
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.960]  記得名字嗎
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.960]  Swan Theory
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.960]  知道Swan是什麼意思嗎
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.960]  Swan是Swan嗎
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]  不是Swan
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.960]  Swan是什麼意思
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960]  記得嗎
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.960]  有人知道嗎
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.960]  有人知道嗎
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.960]  Swan呢
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.960]  是好像暈了
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.960]  有沒有人暈過
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.960]  有沒有人暈過
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.960]  Fainted
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.960]  OK 幾個
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960]  這個理論是這樣的
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.960]  耶穌釘十字架
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.960]  其實是沒有死的
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.960]  祂覺得
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.960]  耶穌只是暈了
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.960]  Swan了
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.960]  OK
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960]  所以
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.960]  祂沒有死
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.960]  祂覺得祂只是暈了
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.960]  我們來看看
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.960]  為什麼這個理論
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.960]  會不正確
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960]  第一
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.960]  是Crucifixion
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.960]  Crucifixion
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.960]  是羅馬的設計
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.960]  怎樣去
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.960]  Maximize
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.960]  你的受苦
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.960]  Maximize你的受苦
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.960]  令你
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.960]  未死的
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.960]  OK
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.960]  有沒有人想試
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.960]  Maximize
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.960]  Suffering
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:54.960]  Towards Death
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.960]  有沒有人想試
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.960]  OK
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.960]  第一
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.960]  祂會打你
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.960]  用一些
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.960]  用一些
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.960]  Thorny的
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.960]  Spikes
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.960]  會打你
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:07.960]  打到你的背
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.960]  傷了
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.960]  然後你要揹著十字架
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.960]  上去這個
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.960]  Crucifixion Area
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.960]  OK
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960]  Next slide
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.960]  你要揹著十字架
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.960]  好像一個
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.960]  一半的Piano
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.960]  那麼重
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.960]  有沒有人
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.960]  幫過搬Piano的
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.960]  有
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.960]  OK
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.960]  Pure
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.960]  有幾個
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.960]  試過
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.960]  你被人打了
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960]  又沒什麼吃
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.960]  又沒什麼喝
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.960]  然後又要
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.960]  搬十字架上去
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.960]  然後
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.960]  被
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.960]  Romans釘十字架
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.960]  Nails in the hands
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.960]  and in the feet
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.960]  然後你Lift it up onto the cross
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.960]  你Hang在這裡
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.960]  有沒有人試過
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.960]  Hang
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.960]  Crossbar
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.960]  在公園那些
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:58.960]  Hang在這裡
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.960]  有沒有Hang在這裡
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:00.960]  OK
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.960]  你Hang在這裡
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.960]  可以Hang多久
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.960]  一分鐘
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.960]  誰說一分鐘
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.960]  OK
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.960]  上來試下
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.960]  開玩笑
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.960]  誰覺得
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.960]  他Hang到一分鐘
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.960]  OK
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.960]  多過一分鐘
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960]  有沒有人覺得
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.960]  OK
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.960]  Jose
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.960]  OK
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960]  平時
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.960]  攀石那些人
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.960]  是可以Hang到久一點的
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.960]  其實不容易的
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.960]  OK
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.960]  你現在
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.960]  不是Hang
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.960]  是什麼
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.960]  Nails
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.960]  OK
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960]  你Hang的時候
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.960]  你覺得呼吸是不是正常的
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.960]  正常
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.960]  是不是正常的
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.960]  其實不是正常的
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.960]  是要
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.960]  少少拿起自己
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.960]  然後才能呼吸
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.960]  OK
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.960]  那Cross的設計是什麼
[00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.960]  你會自己
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.960]  Suffocate
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:48.960]  You will suffocate
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.960]  因為你要拿起自己
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.960]  OK
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.960]  你的腳是很痛苦的
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.960]  你的手是被釘住的
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.960]  你要拿起自己
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:02.960]  去呼吸
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.960]  OK
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:05.960]  The Romans designed crucifixion
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.960]  to maximize the suffering
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.960]  that you had
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.960]  towards death
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.960]  這些soldiers
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.960]  有一個Law的
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.960]  那些soldiers
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.960]  There was a law laid even
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.960]  for a death penalty
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.960]  for any soldier
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.960]  who let the prisoner escape
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.960]  釘十字架
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.960]  那些
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.960]  看著那些兵
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.960]  如果他看到你
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.960]  他還沒死
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.960]  You had the death penalty
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.960]  好像你現在坐牢那些
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.960]  如果那些prisoner
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.960]  prison guard
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.960]  給了那些prisoner escape
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.960]  他自己會有個prison
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.960]  death penalty
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.960]  嚴不嚴重
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.960]  很嚴重
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.960]  You would have the death penalty
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.960]  if you were the guard
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.960]  who let the prisoner go
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.960]  So there was no way
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.960]  that Jesus could not have died
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.960]  Jesus could not have died
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.960]  OK
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.960]  我們繼續讀
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.960]  John chapter 19
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.960]  我們一起讀
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.960]  1,2,3
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.960]  Since it was the day of preparation
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.960]  so the bodies would not remain
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.960]  on the cross
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.960]  on the Sabbath
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.960]  For the Sabbath was
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.960]  on the high day
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.960]  The Jews asked Pilate
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.960]  that their legs might be broken
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.960]  and that they might be taken away
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.960]  So the soldiers came
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.960]  and broke the legs of the first
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.960]  and of the other
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.960]  who had been crucified with him
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.960]  And when they came to Jesus
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.960]  and saw that he was already dead
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.960]  they did not break his legs
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.960]  這個soldier已經看到
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.960]  耶穌是怎樣
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.960]  已經死了
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.960]  所以沒有打爛
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.960]  不是打爛
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.960]  打斷
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.960]  打斷他的腳
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.960]  OK
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.960]  因為是聖誕節
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.960]  這個Jewish festival
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.960]  他就想
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.960]  這些人死了
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.960]  快點死
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.960]  快點死
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.960]  打斷他的腳
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.960]  OK
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.960]  所以我們看了兩個原因
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.960]  為什麼耶穌一定是死了
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.960]  在釘十字架是死了
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.960]  The crucifixion
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.960]  OK
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.960]  Romans perfected the crucifixion towards death
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.960]  第二
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.960]  那個soldier
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.960]  那個soldier是
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.960]  差不多每天都看到
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.960]  crucifixion
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.960]  是不是
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.960]  他就看到
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.960]  耶穌一定是死了
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.960]  第三
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.960]  我們read John the gospel
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.960]  John是
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.960]  disciple of Jesus
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.960]  他自己親眼看到
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.960]  耶穌是死了
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960]  我們一起讀
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.960]  But one of the soldiers pierced his side with the spear
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.960]  and at once they came out blood and water
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.960]  He who saw it was bore witness
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.960]  His testimony is true
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.960]  He knows that he is telling the truth
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.960]  that you also may believe
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.960]  John the gospel writer
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.960]  John寫這本書
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.960]  他親眼看到
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.960]  耶穌是怎樣
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.960]  是死了
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.960]  是有first eye witness
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.960]  還有John gospel writer
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.960]  是寫了什麼
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.960]  他們以前怎樣check
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:17.960]  怎樣check
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960]  那些
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960]  那些
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960]  crucified的人
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960]  是死了沒有
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.960]  他們用那個spear
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.960]  去插
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.960]  插那些
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.960]  crucified的人
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.960]  他們插
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.960]  耶穌的時候
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.960]  他
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.960]  有什麼出來
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.960]  有什麼出來
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.960]  blood and
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.960]  water
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:39.960]  blood and water
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.960]  為什麼會有血和水出來
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.960]  是不是耶穌喝了很多水
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.960]  他的肚被插了
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.960]  然後水都出來了
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:50.960]  是不是
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960]  是不是
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.960]  水從哪裡來的
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.960]  知不知道
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.960]  ok
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.960]  我給幾個

[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.960]  所以
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.960]  血和水出來了
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.960]  這是第一個option

[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.960]  他的liver somehow

[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.960]  喝了很多水
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.960]  是不是
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.960]  你覺得耶穌那天喝了多少水
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960]  其實
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.960]  不會喝了很多水
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.960]  very little water
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.960]  他聽十字架的時候
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:36.960]  他說他很thirsty
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.960]  他們給他喝什麼
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960]  醋
[00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.960]  是不是給了5L的水給他喝
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.960]  不是
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.960]  是給醋
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960]  是不是
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.960]  ok
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.960]  有人的theory就是這樣
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.960]  next slide
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:57.960]  那些soldier插了什麼
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.960]  插了他的心
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.960]  這個theory
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.960]  我讀給你聽
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960]  這個是一個theory
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.960]  you can believe it or not
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.960]  the soldier punctured
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.960]  when he speared Jesus
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.960]  there is a membrane
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.960]  that surrounds the heart
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.960]  called the pericardic sac
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.960]  pericardic sac
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.960]  when the heart ruptures
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:23.960]  blood leaks from the heart
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.960]  and fills the pericardic sac
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.960]  and while it sits
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:32.960]  blood will separate from the plasma
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.960]  Jesus did not die
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960]  of asphyxiation
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.960]  which is suffocation
[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.960]  but of a broken heart
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.960]  這個theory是什麼
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.960]  耶穌不是suffocation死的
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.960]  耶穌
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.960]  他的heart attack
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.960]  his heart bursted
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.960]  ok
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]  because of a heart attack
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:55.960]  然後
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.960]  他的theory是這樣
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.960]  blood and the plasma filled the heart
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.960]  the sac
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.960]  然後
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.960]  blood and the plasma fluid
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:08.960]  separated
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.960]  所以有blood and water
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.960]  so Jesus died of a broken heart
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.960]  broken heart
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.960]  有沒有人聽過這個theory
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960]  有沒有人聽過這個theory
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960]  ok
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:22.960]  I am glad you learned something new
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.960]  ok
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.960]  所以我們有幾個reason
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.960]  crucifixion
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.960]  ok
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.960]  Romans perfected the crucifixion
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:31.960]  第二
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.960]  soldier
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.960]  兵沒有打斷耶穌的腳
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.960]  因為他看到耶穌已經死了
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.960]  第三
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:39.960]  gospel writer
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.960]  John
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.960]  親眼看到耶穌死了
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.960]  第四
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.960]  there was blood and water
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.960]  to prove that Jesus had in fact died
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960]  and we think
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960]  one of the theories
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.960]  is he died of a broken heart
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.960]  第四
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.960]  Jesus was entombed
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.960]  ok
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.960]  Jesus was entombed
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.960]  now in the place where he was crucified
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:03.960]  there was a garden
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.960]  and in the garden was a new tomb
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.960]  where no one had yet been laid
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:09.960]  ok
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960]  so they took the body of Jesus
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.960]  and bound it in lemon clothes
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.960]  and with spices
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.960]  and buried it
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.960]  as was the custom of the Jews
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.960]  這些猶太人呢
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.960]  看到耶穌是死了
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.960]  所以就用他們的custom
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.960]  去包了他的body
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.960]  ok
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.960]  如果耶穌只是faint了
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.960]  不是他會繼續breathing嗎
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.960]  他不會醒嗎
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:35.960]  這三天
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.960]  他不會醒嗎
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960]  ok
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.960]  第四
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.960]  the next reason
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.960]  the disciples were convinced
[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.960]  he was dead
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.960]  the disciples were convinced
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.960]  he was dead
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.960]  Thomas
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.960]  他說
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.960]  主耶穌是不是真的你
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.960]  如果真的是你
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.960]  我可不可以摸摸
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.960]  你的傷口
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.960]  我可不可以摸摸
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.960]  你的傷口在你的身旁
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.960]  Thomas the doubter
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.960]  even Thomas the doubter believed
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.960]  that he had died
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.960]  and was resurrected
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.960]  ok
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.960]  那我們就看到
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.960]  Swoon theory
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.960]  conclusion是什麼
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.960]  conclusion是這個
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.960]  there is sufficient evidence
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.960]  physical evidence
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960]  Roman witnesses
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.960]  from the soldier
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.960]  Christian witnesses
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.960]  to show that Jesus did in fact die
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.960]  therefore
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.960]  the Swoon theory
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:36.960]  that he did not die
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.960]  that he simply fainted
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.960]  is not correct
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.960]  ok
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.960]  the theory is not correct
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.960]  第一個theory
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960]  是一個Swoon theory
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.960]  第二個theory
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.960]  是一個conspiracy theory
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.960]  conspiracy theory
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.960]  這個conspiracy theory
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.960]  就是說
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.960]  耶穌是有死的
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.960]  但是
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960]  門徒
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.960]  是make up this story
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.960]  make up this story
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.960]  耶穌是復活
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.960]  他make up this story
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.960]  那
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.960]  next slide是誰來的
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.960]  是誰
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.960]  這個叫什麼
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.960]  Pinocchio
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.960]  他說謊的時候
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.960]  他的鼻子會很長
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.960]  是不是
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.960]  你為什麼說謊
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.960]  有沒有人說過謊話的
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.960]  舉手
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.960]  有沒有人說過謊話的
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.960]  舉手
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.960]  是嗎
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.960]  有些人沒有說過謊話的
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.960]  wow
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.960]  為什麼你們說謊話的
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.960]  為什麼你們說謊話
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.960]  為什麼你們說謊話
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.960]  不想別人知道
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.960]  真的
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.960]  ok
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.960]  there has to be a benefit
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:47.960]  是不是
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.960]  你說謊話
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.960]  是不是因為你覺得
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.960]  對你自己有benefit的
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:53.960]  是不是
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.960]  如果對你自己沒有benefit
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.960]  為什麼你要說謊話
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.960]  是不是
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:58.960]  ok
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.960]  so here are some of the reasons
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.960]  why we think
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.960]  that the conspiracy theory is not right
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.960]  第一
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:06.960]  是
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.960]  the disciples challenged all authorities
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.960]  and faced punishment on all sides
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.960]  if it was a conspiracy
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.960]  ok
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.960]  如果門徒作
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:18.960]  耶穌
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.960]  是復活
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.960]  他
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.960]  他challenge什麼authority
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.960]  有什麼authority
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.960]  第一
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.960]  是Roman authority
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.960]  ok
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:30.960]  他challenge Roman authority
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.960]  是不是
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.960]  Romans perfected the crucifixion
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.960]  soldiers
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.960]  如果被人escape了
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.960]  他們自己會有death penalty
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:46.960]  so they were challenging the Roman authorities
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.960]  他們又challenge什麼authority
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.960]  the Jewish authorities
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.960]  the Jews wanted him dead
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960]  the Jewish authorities
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.960]  the high priest
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.960]  they wanted him dead
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.960]  so they would face punishment from the Jews
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.960]  they would face punishment from the Roman authorities
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.960]  there was no advantage to lie
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.960]  the result was being hated
[00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:08.960]  scorn
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960]  persecuted
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.960]  excommunicated
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.960]  imprisoned
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.960]  tortured
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.960]  exiled
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.960]  crucified
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.960]  boiled alive
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.960]  roasted
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.960]  beheaded
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.960]  disembodied
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.960]  and fed to lions
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.960]  ok
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.960]  有什麼benefit
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.960]  沒有benefit
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.960]  為什麼他們會作耶穌復活
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960]  然後說謊話
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.960]  有什麼benefit
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.960]  是沒有benefit
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.960]  是不是
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.960]  你在測驗的時候
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.960]  是copy
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:40.960]  cheat
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.960]  你的benefit是什麼
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.960]  你想pass the exam
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.960]  是不是
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.960]  但如果你cheat
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.960]  是沒有benefit的
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.960]  那你cheat來幹嘛呢
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.960]  是不是
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.960]  所以這些門徒
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.960]  是沒有benefit
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.960]  他challenge the Roman authority
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.960]  是會釘十字架
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.960]  又會被人扔去
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.960]  坐牢
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.960]  那些Jewish authorities
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:05.960]  又會踢走他們
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.960]  是不是
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.960]  有什麼benefit呢
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.960]  沒有benefit
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.960]  ok
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.960]  接著我們又看
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.960]  門徒的character
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.960]  我們看門徒的character
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.960]  他們多數是做什麼的
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.960]  門徒做什麼的
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.960]  是釣魚的
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.960]  還有呢
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.960]  還有
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.960]  follow Jesus
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.960]  他們是不是好像magician
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.960]  經常騙人錢
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:31.960]  經常偷人的錢
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.960]  我們看到門徒的character
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:34.960]  是不是這樣
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.960]  不是
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:37.960]  in fact
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.960]  耶穌釘了十字架的時候
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960]  是不是
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]  死了的時候
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.960]  他們怎樣
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.960]  很害怕
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.960]  他們去hiding
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.960]  他們回到他們的房間
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]  他們的house
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.960]  hiding
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.960]  他們害怕Roman authorities
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.960]  去捉他們
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:54.960]  是不是
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.960]  我們看到門徒的character
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.960]  不是騙人的
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.960]  他們是很害怕
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:01.960]  他們害怕Roman authorities
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.960]  害怕Jewish authorities
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.960]  所以我們的conclusion
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.960]  是什麼
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.960]  the disciples had no benefit to lie
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.960]  and this went against
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.960]  their known character
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.960]  and their reaction
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.960]  所以我們的conclusion
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.960]  就是conspiracy theory
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.960]  不對的
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:24.960]  conspiracy theory
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.960]  不對
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.960]  第三個theory
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.960]  有沒有人記得
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.960]  第三個theory是什麼
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.960]  hallucination
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.960]  這個hallucination theory
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.960]  是說耶穌是死了
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.960]  但是門徒
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.960]  是hallucinating
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.960]  他們看到耶穌復活的時候
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:49.960]  他們hallucinating
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.960]  他們做夢
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.960]  或者中文是什麼
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.960]  hallucination
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.960]  幻象
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:01.960]  有沒有人試過幻象
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.960]  hallucination
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.960]  有沒有人試過
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.960]  Alvin有嗎
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.960]  沒有
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.960]  你見到誰
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.960]  Alvin
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.960]  那些chipmunk
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:10.960]  是不是chipmunk
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:11.960]  在你的房間裡
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.960]  沒有
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.960]  有沒有試過hallucination
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.960]  有沒有人
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.960]  沒有人試過
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.960]  你試過
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.960]  你見到什麼
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.960]  跳舞
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.960]  是一些shadow
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.960]  ok
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.960]  那你見了多久
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.960]  可能在做夢
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.960]  吃了一些藥
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.960]  ok
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.960]  hallucination的definition是什麼
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.960]  我們看下一個slide
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:40.960]  hallucination
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:48.960]  hallucination are where you hear, see, smell, taste, or feel things that appear to be real
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.960]  but only exist in your mind
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.960]  我有一個朋友
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:24:00.960]  他之前是有些schizophrenia
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.960]  然後又有covid
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.960]  covid就isolate了他自己
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:13.960]  然後他就覺得有人經常追他
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.960]  他覺得不知為什麼一個外國人在美國經常追他
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.960]  可能偷聽他的電話
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.960]  黑他的computer
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.960]  他經常覺得有人追他
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.960]  他就想死
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.960]  我有一個朋友真的這樣
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.960]  他真的要見psychologist
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.960]  吃藥
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.960]  因為他suffer from schizophrenia
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.960]  我真的有一個朋友是這樣的
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:49.960]  這個朋友還在吃藥
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.960]  他現在是improve了
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.960]  他現在realize他之前有一個mental issue
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.960]  he was seeing things, hearing things that were not true
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.960]  他聽到的聲音是有人追著你
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.960]  有人coming towards you
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:13.960]  我們現在看為什麼hallucination theory是不正確
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.960]  第一,there were too many witnesses
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:19.960]  你們猜猜有多少個witness
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.960]  耶穌是復活的
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.960]  有多少人見證過耶穌復活
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.960]  你們猜猜
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.960]  聊天的男生
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:40.960]  你們猜猜有多少人見證過耶穌復活
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.960]  你猜猜
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.960]  凌
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.960]  Adam
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:56.960]  Ethan
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.960]  Anson
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.960]  Lucas
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.960]  到你
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960]  13個
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.960]  為什麼
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.960]  因為12個滿途
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.960]  然後還有一個
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.960]  你
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.960]  100個
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.960]  有沒有人想猜
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.960]  Kid

[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.960]  兩個
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.960]  2000
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.960]  太多了
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.960]  我們一起讀
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.960]  下一頁
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.960]  準備
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]  1,2,3
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.960]  他被埋葬
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.960]  他在第三天被誕生
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.960]  根據福音
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.960]  他出現了西斐斯
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:46.960]  是彼得
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.960]  然後是12個
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.960]  然後出現了500多個兄弟
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.960]  在同一時間
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.960]  大部分還活著
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.960]  有些已經睡著了
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.960]  然後出現了詹姆斯
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.960]  然後是聖徒
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.960]  最後
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.960]  出現了一個復活的
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.960]  他也出現了
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960]  我
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.960]  這個寫大概有多少人
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.960]  500多個
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.960]  到12個
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.960]  12個滿途
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.960]  500個兄弟
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.960]  然後
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.960]  聖徒
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:24.960]  到詹姆斯
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:25.960]  聖徒
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.960]  還有
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.960]  誰寫的這本書
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.960]  保羅
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.960]  保羅寫的
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.960]  他也出現了
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.960]  然後也出現了
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.960]  所以有多少人
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.960]  Ethan 有多少人
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.960]  見證了耶穌的復活
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.960]  Yes
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.960]  500多個
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.960]  這是你們在討論的
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.960]  對嗎
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.960]  非常好
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:49.960]  哇
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.960]  非常好
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.960]  第一個原因
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.960]  為什麼幻覺理論不能正確
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.960]  因為太多人見證了
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.960]  太多人見證了
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:04.960]  多數是個人有不同的幻覺
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.960]  如果真正有幻覺
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.960]  是不同的幻覺
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.960]  但這個太多人了
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960]  第二
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.960]  見證者是真實的
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.960]  這個不是500個見證者
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.960]  來自心理醫院
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.960]  在醫院的心理醫院
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.960]  500個見證者來自心理醫院
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.960]  不是的
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.960]  這些是正常人
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.960]  他們是徒弟
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.960]  他們是正常人
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.960]  正常人
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960]  OK
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.960]  不是有心理問題的歷史
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.960]  這些是正常人
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.960]  還有500個人
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.960]  同時見證了耶穌
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.960]  500個人
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.960]  是一起
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.960]  同時見證了
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.960]  耶穌的復活
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.960]  所以500個人
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.960]  是整個房間
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.960]  他們是整個房間
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.960]  他們是整個房間
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.960]  然後把所有人放在一種氣體
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.960]  然後他們都看到了
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.960]  會不會呢
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.960]  很難
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.960]  還有他們以前有什麼氣體
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.960]  不知道
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960]  有什麼氣體
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.960]  可能只有
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:17.960]  OK
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.960]  還有呢
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.960]  幻覺通常維持多久
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.960]  他們通常維持多久
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.960]  不久
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:27.960]  是不是
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.960]  但是耶穌出現了多久
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.960]  和這些門徒
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]  有人猜到
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.960]  耶穌在復活之後
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.960]  出現了多少天
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.960]  有人猜到
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.960]  耶穌出現了多少天
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:47.960]  OK
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.960]  誰覺得是
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.960]  少於十天
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.960]  舉手
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.960]  OK
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.960]  誰覺得是
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.960]  十天到二十天
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.960]  十天到二十天
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.960]  OK
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.960]  誰覺得是
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.960]  三十天左右
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.960]  三十天
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.960]  OK
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.960]  誰覺得是
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.960]  四十天左右
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.960]  舉手
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.960]  OK 下一頁
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:21.960]  下一頁
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.960]  1 2 3
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.960]  He presented himself alive
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.960]  你們不讀嗎
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.960]  1 2 3
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.960]  He presented himself alive to them
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.960]  after his suffering
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:34.960]  by many proofs
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.960]  appearing to them during forty days
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.960]  and speaking about the kingdom of God
[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.960]  耶穌復活
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.960]  然後出現了多少天
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.960]  40 days
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.960]  這些五百人
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.960]  四十天
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.960]  四十天
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:55.960]  難嗎
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.960]  五百人
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960]  看到耶穌
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960]  他們都在幻想
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.960]  同一件事
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.960]  然後四十天
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.960]  難嗎
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.960]  非常難
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.960]  幾乎不可能
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:11.960]  幾乎不可能
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.960]  所以我們看到
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.960]  這個幻想理論
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.960]  多數不是正確
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.960]  最後
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.960]  耶穌出現在徒弟們身上
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.960]  OK
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.960]  耶穌出現在徒弟們身上
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.960]  我們一起讀
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.960]  我們一起讀
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.960]  OK
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:28.960]  男孩們在後面
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:29.960]  一起讀
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.960]  1 2 3
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.960]  他們在說這些事
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.960]  耶穌自己站在他們身上
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.960]  對他們說
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960]  和平
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.960]  他們被驚慌
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.960]  被驚慌
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.960]  他們看到了靈魂
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.960]  然後祂對他們說
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.960]  為什麼你們有困難
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.960]  為什麼你們有疑問
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.960]  為什麼你們有疑問
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.960]  在你們的心裡
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.960]  看著我的手和腳
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.960]  這是我
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.960]  觸摸我
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:54.960]  看著我
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.960]  因為我的靈魂
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.960]  沒有肉和骨頭
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.960]  就像你們看到的
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.960]  對不起
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.960]  對不起
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.960]  (聽不清)
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.960]  OK 再說一次
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.960]  而他們仍然對快樂不信
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.960]  而仍然對快樂不信
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:12.960]  而仍然在驚慌
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.960]  祂對他們說
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.960]  你們有什麼吃的嗎
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.960]  他們給了他們一塊熟的魚
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.960]  然後祂吃了
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.960]  然後吃了
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.960]  在他們面前
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.960]  如果是驚慌呢
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.960]  驚慌
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:27.960]  平時會不會吃東西
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.960]  驚慌
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.960]  你會不會碰到牠的肉
[00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.960]  牠的傷口
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.960]  驚慌
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.960]  不只是這個情況
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:38.960]  牠吃東西
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.960]  之後牠出現
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.960]  吃了魚
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.960]  吃了不同的東西
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.960]  超過40天
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.960]  驚慌
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.960]  牠會不會吃東西呢
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.960]  你會不會摸到牠呢
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.960]  所以
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.960]  這不是正確的
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.960]  還有
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.960]  還有最後一個原因
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.960]  如果這個理論是正確的
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.960]  如果這個理論是正確的
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.960]  那麼耶穌的身體
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.960]  會在寺廟裡
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.960]  很容易被用作證據
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.960]  對抗教會的
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:15.960]  如果
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.960]  那些猶太人
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:17.960]  知道那些門徒
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.960]  是在說謊
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.960]  還有他們是在做夢
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.960]  在幻想
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.960]  那麼很容易
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.960]  他們會展示耶穌的身體
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.960]  那就是證據
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.960]  這是證據
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.960]  我們有耶穌的身體
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.960]  你們是錯誤的
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.960]  你們的理論是錯誤的
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.960]  那麼結論是什麼呢
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.960]  有很多的證據
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.960]  證據的角色
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.960]  和耶穌的個人表現
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960]  顯示了
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.960]  幻想是不可能的
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.960]  是不可能的
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.960]  那麼我們看了三個理論
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.960]  叫什麼名字
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.960]  第一個理論叫什麼名字
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.960]  Swoon Theory
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.960]  不正確
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.960]  第二個理論是什麼呢
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.960]  Conspiracy Theory
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:08.960]  不正確
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.960]  第三個是什麼呢
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.960]  Hallucination Theory
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.960]  第四個理論
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.960]  最後一個理論我們要看的
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.960]  是Myth Theory
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.960]  這個Myth是什麼呢
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.960]  耶穌的死亡和復活的教會的事實
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.960]  只是一個假設
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.960]  就像是希臘的神話
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.960]  OK
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.960]  希臘的神話
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.960]  第一個證據
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.960]  是內在的證據
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.960]  神話的內在
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.960]  是基督徒寫的
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.960]  四位基督徒
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.960]  三位基督徒和一位耶穌的追隨者
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.960]  博士Luke
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:48.960]  它有正確的名字
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.960]  日期
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:50.960]  文化日期
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.960]  歷史事件
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.960]  傳統和當時的意見
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.960]  我的英文很差
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.960]  我的英文
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.960]  歷史上很準確
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.960]  準確的名字
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.960]  準確的日期
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:09.960]  不單止是聖經自己說
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.960]  耶穌死亡和復活
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.960]  有外來證據
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:15.960]  外來證據
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.960]  很多外來證據
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.960]  我們看下一個頁面
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.960]  這些人
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.960]  這些人不是基督徒
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.960]  但他們也寫了關於耶穌的書
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.960]  這個人怎麼讀呢
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960]  第一個是
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.960]  Finnie
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.960]  他寫了關於耶穌的追隨者
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.960]  追隨者認為祂是神
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.960]  第一和第二
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.960]  我不知道其他名字
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.960]  S字頭那個
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.960]  耶穌是真正的人
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.960]  稱呼耶穌
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.960]  造成了猶太人的擾亂
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.960]  Selassius
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.960]  據說是一位女婿
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.960]  一位爺爺
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.960]  有奇蹟的力量
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.960]  Josephus
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.960]  說耶穌是一個聰明的人
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.960]  追隨者
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.960]  報告了復活
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.960]  Talmud
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.960]  在聖誕前就執行了
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.960]  有奇蹟的力量
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.960]  OK
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.960]  下一個
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.960]  Thalys
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.960]  耶穌活了
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.960]  耶穌被祭祀
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:10.960]  當祂死去的時候
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.960]  有黑暗和地震
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.960]  Testius
[00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:16.960]  稱呼耶穌
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:17.960]  追隨者
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:18.960]  執行了
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:19.960]  追隨者
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.960]  這些全部人
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.960]  不是基督徒
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.960]  他們是歷史學家
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.960]  但他們寫了關於耶穌
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.960]  祂的死亡
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.960]  祂的復活
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.960]  祂的追隨者
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.960]  所以我們看到
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.960]  有內在的證據
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.960]  聖經自己有說
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.960]  耶穌死和復活
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.960]  外在的證據
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:42.960]  有些人說了耶穌的死
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.960]  祂的復活
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.960]  追隨者
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:46.960]  還有什麼
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.960]  如果門徒是作這個故事
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.960]  為什麼他們會
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:56.960]  誰是耶穌的復活的第一itness
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.960]  誰是第一itness
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.960]  誰是
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.960]  第一
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.960]  看到空的墓地
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.960]  是誰
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.960]  是女人
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.960]  如果你是
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.960]  作一個故事
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.960]  為什麼你會用
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:17.960]  第一itness
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.960]  作為女人
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:20.960]  女人以前不是
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.960]  可信的itness
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.960]  為什麼你不用一個
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.960]  很可信的itness
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.960]  一個high priest
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.960]  一個teacher of the law
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.960]  一個saducee
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.960]  去first witness
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.960]  空的墓地
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:36.960]  他們用女人
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.960]  作為第一itness
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.960]  以前女人
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.960]  不是可信的itness
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.960]  還有呢
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:47.960]  如果門徒是作這個
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.960]  復活故事
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.960]  這違反了
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.960]  耶穌的復活的規則
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.960]  之前的猶太人
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.960]  覺得復活是何時會復活
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.960]  知不知道
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.960]  有人知嗎
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.960]  有人知嗎
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.960]  猶太人之前是覺得
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.960]  何時才會復活
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.960]  on the last days
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:12.960]  you remember Mary and Martha
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.960]  Martha was like
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:15.960]  oh yeah we believe in the resurrection
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.960]  the resurrection will happen on the last day
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.960]  which is
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.960]  when the Messiah comes
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.960]  and restores everything
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.960]  他們不知道
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:28.960]  they did not believe that
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.960]  Jesus would resurrect
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.960]  it was against their custom
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960]  還有呢
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]  they did not believe that
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.960]  the Messiah needed to resurrect either
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.960]  they did not believe the Messiah would die
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:45.960]  so this went against their Jewish customs
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.960]  so disciples would have to be
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.960]  really creative
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.960]  to make up this story
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.960]  還有呢
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.960]  the religious opponents
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.960]  could not produce Jesus' body
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.960]  我們
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:01.960]  and the soldiers were bribed
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.960]  to spread lies
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.960]  yet still people believed in the resurrection
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.960]  alright let's look at the next passage
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.960]  when the chief priests
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.960]  had met with the elders
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.960]  and devised a plan
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.960]  they gave the soldiers a large sum of money
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.960]  telling them
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:19.960]  you are to say
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.960]  the disciples came during the night
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.960]  and stole the body
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.960]  while they were away
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.960]  for this report
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.960]  gets to the governor
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.960]  he will be satisfied
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.960]  and keep you out of trouble
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.960]  他們是給錢
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.960]  給了錢
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.960]  the disciples
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.960]  去說謊
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.960]  and yet they
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.960]  the people still believed
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.960]  in the resurrection
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.960]  so therefore the conclusion is
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.960]  the synoptic gospels
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.960]  offer us evidence
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:53.960]  that the disciples did not make up this story
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.960]  that there is external evidence about Jesus
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:57.960]  also confirms this
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.960]  and the religious authorities
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.960]  could easily reveal the body of Christ
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.960]  if the resurrection were not true
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.960]  所以我們看到四個理論
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.960]  今天
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.960]  ok
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.960]  Spoon theory
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.960]  Conspiracy theory
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.960]  Hallucination theory
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.960]  The myth theory
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.960]  全部都覺得沒有什麼證據
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.960]  for these theories
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.960]  therefore we believe
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.960]  that Jesus has risen
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.960]  Jesus has risen
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:31.960]  Jesus is alive
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.960]  the difference between Christianity
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.960]  and all other religions in the world
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.960]  is what
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.960]  is that our God lives
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.960]  our God lives
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.960]  Islam
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.960]  did Muhammad die
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.960]  Muhammad died
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:52.960]  Buddha
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.960]  did Buddha die
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.960]  Buddha died
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.960]  Johnny
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.960]  Confucius
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:00.960]  did he die
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.960]  Confucius died
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.960]  but Christianity is different
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:05.960]  and it is special
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.960]  because Christianity
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.960]  Jesus did not die
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.960]  we have a God that lives
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:13.960]  that is what makes
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.960]  Christianity so special
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:17.960]  and that is why
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.960]  your belief in Christianity
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.960]  is meaningful
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.960]  because we believe in a God
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.960]  that lives
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.960]  and so as the band comes up
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.960]  I want us to think about
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:32.960]  today
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.960]  as the band comes up
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.960]  我們每個人閉上眼
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:38.960]  let's close our eyes
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.960]  let's turn off our phones
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.960]  let's stop playing games for a sec
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.960]  let's just talk between you and God
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.960]  you want to talk
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.960]  talk to God
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.960]  ok
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.960]  let's close our eyes
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.960]  if you want to talk
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.960]  talk to the Lord
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.960]  let's talk to the Lord right now
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.960]  maybe you've come to church so many times
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:05.960]  you've heard the Easter message so many times
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:08.960]  and yet you've never actually believed
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.960]  that Jesus died
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.960]  and He rose again
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:17.960]  are you one of these people today
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.960]  are you one of these people today
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.960]  maybe you've come to church a long time
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.960]  your parents are forcing you to come to church
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.960]  and you have not actually believed
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.960]  that Jesus has died
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.960]  and rose again
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.960]  today we talked about four theories
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.960]  we broke down why these four theories are not correct
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.960]  and that is why we believe Jesus is alive
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.960]  our God lives
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.960]  let's everybody just close your eyes right now
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.960]  close your eyes
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.960]  have you come to a point
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.960]  where God is real to you
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.960]  Jesus is real to you
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.960]  Jesus is the greatest person alive
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.960]  He's better than any Instagram influencer
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.960]  YouTube influencer
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:21.960]  He's greater than any athlete
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.960]  any debater
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.960]  He's better than all these people
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.960]  because He died and rose again
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.960]  Our God is not dead
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.960]  if Jesus died and did not rise
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.960]  I would not stand here
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:40.960]  because He's no different than Buddha
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.960]  Mohammed
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.960]  those guys died
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:44.960]  Confucius
[00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.960]  they died
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.960]  but I stand here today
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.960]  and I spend my time
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.960]  I've spent all my life
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.960]  trying to convince people
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.960]  that Jesus is alive
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.960]  and that is why I stand here
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.960]  and I want to challenge each one of you tonight
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.960]  today
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.960]  have you made a decision
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:11.960]  to put your trust
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.960]  in a God that is alive
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.960]  who conquered death
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.960]  who died in the most painful way
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.960]  on the cross for your sins
