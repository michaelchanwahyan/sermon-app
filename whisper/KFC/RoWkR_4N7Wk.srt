1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,120
 Hi, my name is Joseph T. I'm from the Philippines and I've been living in Hong Kong for over

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,120
 40 years.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,120
 So I'm originally from Australia, hence the beautiful accent.

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:26,000
 I'm second generation on one side with ancestry in England and Scotland and then first generation

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,720
 on the other side where my dad comes from Switzerland which is where I inherited my

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,000
 deep, deep love for chocolate.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,240
 Hi, I'm Peter.

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,240
 I'm Cherry.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
 I'm Florence.

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,000
 We're raised in Hong Kong and we've been here our entire lives.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,200
 Greetings from New Zealand.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,520
 My family history is pretty much like the family history of many people in Hong Kong.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,800
 My parents, my father and my mother actually came to Hong Kong when they were just a few

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,680
 years old as refugees because of the Chinese-Japanese War.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,920
 And they settled down here and they grew up here and eventually they built a family here.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,280
 So my brothers and I were all born in Hong Kong, grew up, brought up here and we were

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,240
 educated here in Hong Kong.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,600
 Eventually we built our families here in Hong Kong.

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,960
 So my sons are also born in Hong Kong.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,920
 Welcome wherever you are.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:32,200
 It was really good to start this off by seeing the faces of our people.

22
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,720
 I miss seeing you face to face.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,920
 The good news and hopefully it will be next week, we are going to come back together again

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
 and have a service together.

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:54,840
 So I will be able to see you face to face or at least mask to mask.

26
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:04,200
 Twenty or thirty years after Jesus had gone back to heaven, a Jewish disciple named Matthew

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,680
 was inspired by the Spirit of God to write a book.

28
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:18,440
 The finished product is what we know today as the Gospel of Matthew.

29
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:26,800
 We're going to spend the seven weeks of Lent taking a whistle stop tour through the book

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,120
 to coincide with the one campaign that we're doing.

31
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:39,720
 And I heard today 41,234 Christians in Hong Kong are doing.

32
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,320
 I want to give you some background and to do so I want you to look at this chart.

33
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,400
 Look carefully.

34
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,280
 Each of the four Gospels has got its own emphasis.

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,680
 Matthew's book is called the Gospel of the King.

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,000
 It was written primarily for Jewish readers.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,040
 Mark's book, the Gospel of the Servant, was written to instruct Roman readers.

38
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:22,280
 Luke wrote mainly to the Greeks and presented Christ as the perfect Son of Man.

39
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:28,480
 John's appeal is universal and his message was, "This is the Son of God."

40
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,000
 No one Gospel is able to tell the whole story as God wants us to see it.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,400
 But when we put these four Gospel accounts together, we have a composite picture of the

42
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,920
 person and the work of our Lord.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:56,240
 The book of Matthew was written by Matthew, one of the twelve disciples of Jesus.

44
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:02,120
 Matthew was a tax collector before Jesus called him to be one of his disciples.

45
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,680
 And let me just expand on that a little bit.

46
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,760
 A tax collector then wasn't like a tax collector today.

47
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,580
 A tax collector at the time was hated, was despised.

48
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:22,440
 The central message of Matthew's Gospel was Jesus the King.

49
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:30,880
 The words, "the Kingdom of Heaven" are mentioned 33 times in this book.

50
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:40,320
 Now nowhere in the four Gospels do we find a single word recorded that Matthew spoke.

51
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,920
 Yet in his Gospel he gives us the words and works of Jesus.

52
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:55,200
 He started off by calling Christ the Son of David, the Son of Abraham.

53
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,400
 Matthew did not write to tell us about himself.

54
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:08,360
 But over the next seven weeks, let's get acquainted with him and the book he wrote.

55
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:17,320
 Then we can all learn what he wanted us to know about Jesus Christ.

56
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:27,560
 The Holy Spirit used Matthew to accomplish three important tasks in writing the Gospel.

57
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,760
 Number one, he was the bridge builder.

58
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,520
 He introduced a new book.

59
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,080
 That book was the New Testament.

60
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:47,480
 If a Bible reader were to jump from Malachi into Mark or Acts or Romans, he would be bewildered.

61
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:54,040
 Matthew's Gospel is the bridge that leads us out of the New Testament and into the New

62
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,760
 Testament.

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:06,520
 Matthew used at least 129 quotations or allusions to the Old Testament in this Gospel.

64
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:16,040
 He wrote primarily for Jewish readers to show them that Jesus Christ was indeed their promised

65
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,320
 Messiah.

66
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,680
 The second thing we learn about Matthew, he was the biographer.

67
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,720
 He introduced a new king.

68
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,940
 You know, none of the four Gospels is a biography in the modern sense of the word.

69
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:41,880
 There are many details about the earthly life of Jesus not given in any of the Gospels.

70
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,780
 What we will see that while Matthew does not contradict the other three Gospel writers,

71
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:53,720
 he does follow his own pattern.

72
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:02,860
 In particular, his emphasis on the kingship of Jesus Christ.

73
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,560
 So Matthew was not only a bridge builder who introduced a new book, the New Testament,

74
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,720
 and a biographer who introduced a new king, Jesus Christ, but he also accomplished a third

75
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,900
 task when he wrote this book.

76
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:26,760
 Matthew was the believer who introduced us to a new people.

77
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,400
 The new people, of course, was the Church.

78
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,280
 Matthew is the only Gospel writer to use the word "Church".

79
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:44,560
 The Greek word translated "Church", "Ekklesia", means a "cored out assembly".

80
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,980
 So even though Matthew wrote primarily for the Jews, he has a universal element in his

81
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:59,640
 book that includes the Gentiles.

82
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:10,960
 Over the next seven weeks, we will look at seven aspects of the life of Jesus.

83
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,320
 But I want to ask a question to begin with.

84
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:27,960
 If a man suddenly appears to be a king, the public immediately asks for proof.

85
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,260
 So what is his background?

86
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,280
 Who pays homage to him?

87
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,600
 And what credentials can he present?

88
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:47,000
 Now anticipating these questions, Matthew opened his book with a careful account of

89
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,860
 the birth of Jesus Christ and the events that accompanied it.

90
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,880
 He presented four facts about the King.

91
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,160
 Let's look at them in the first chapters of Matthew.

92
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,640
 Number one was this, the hereditary, the heredity of the King.

93
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:23,680
 Since royalty depends on heredity, it was important for Matthew and for Jesus to establish

94
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,400
 his rights to David's throne.

95
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,120
 So what Matthew did was two things.

96
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:41,600
 He gave him human heredity as well as his divine, his heavenly heredity.

97
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,100
 I won't have time to look at them in great detail.

98
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:58,260
 But let's listen, actually let's watch, firstly about his human heredity.

99
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:07,820
 This is the genealogy of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

100
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:14,460
 Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, Jacob the father of Judah

101
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:22,820
 and his brothers, Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, Perez the

102
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:31,820
 father of Hezron, Hezron the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the

103
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:39,940
 father of Nashon, Nashon the father of Salmon, Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was

104
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:49,180
 Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse

105
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,380
 the father of King David.

106
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:58,460
 David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife, Solomon the father

107
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:06,980
 of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa, Asa the father of

108
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:16,300
 Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Jehoram, Jehoram the father of Uzziah, Uzziah the father

109
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:27,140
 of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, Hezekiah the father

110
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:35,100
 of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah, and Josiah the

111
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:42,380
 father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.

112
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:49,740
 After the exile to Babylon, Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father

113
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:58,780
 of Zerubbabel, Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father

114
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:09,100
 of Esau, Esau the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Akim, Akim the father of Eliud,

115
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:19,180
 Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Mathan, Mathan the father of Jacob, and

116
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:25,340
 Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary.

117
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:33,740
 And Mary was the mother of Jesus who is called the Messiah.

118
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,940
 Thus there were fourteen generations in all from Abraham to David, fourteen from David

119
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:49,140
 to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Messiah.

120
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:55,940
 Genealogies were very important to the Jews, for without them they could not prove their

121
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:03,100
 tribal membership to rights, to inheritances.

122
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:09,980
 Anyone claiming to be the son of David had to be able to prove it.

123
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,520
 Now in the Gospels we have two different genealogies.

124
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,700
 If you have time this week, compare the genealogy in Matthew to that in Luke.

125
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,720
 It is generally concluded that Matthew gave our Lord's family tree through his foster

126
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,460
 father Joseph, while Luke gave Mary's lineage.

127
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:40,900
 Now many Bible readers skip over this list of ancient and, can I say in some cases, unpronounceable

128
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
 names.

129
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:49,500
 But this list of names is a vital part of the Gospel record.

130
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:57,380
 It shows that Jesus Christ is a part of history, that all of Jewish history prepared the way

131
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,380
 for his birth.

132
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:06,320
 God in his providence ruled and overruled to accomplish the great purpose in bringing

133
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,420
 his son into the world.

134
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:17,100
 This genealogy also illustrates God's wonderful grace.

135
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:24,620
 It is most unusual, at least at the time, to find the names of women in Jewish genealogies,

136
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,940
 since names and inheritance generally came through the fathers.

137
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:36,220
 But in this list we find references to four women from the Old Testament.

138
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:49,220
 Tamar in verse 3, Ruth and Rahab in verse 5 and Bathsheba, wife of Uriah in verse 6.

139
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,020
 Matthew clearly omitted some names from the genealogy.

140
00:14:54,020 --> 00:15:02,940
 Now probably he did this to give a systematic summary of three periods in Israel's history,

141
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,060
 each with 14 generations.

142
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:15,700
 Interestingly, the numerical value of the Hebrew letters for David equals 14.

143
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:23,900
 Matthew probably used this approach as a memory aid to help his readers remember this difficult

144
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,980
 list.

145
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:35,220
 But there were many Jewish men who could trace their family back to King David.

146
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,660
 It would take more than human pedigree to make Jesus Christ the son of David and heir

147
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,420
 to David's throne.

148
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:53,020
 That is why the heavenly heredity is so important.

149
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,140
 Let's listen to that.

150
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,880
 This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about.

151
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,620
 His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph.

152
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:22,540
 But before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit.

153
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,580
 Because Joseph, her husband, was faithful to the law and yet did not want to expose

154
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:38,100
 her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.

155
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,180
 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and

156
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:52,300
 said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what

157
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,260
 is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

158
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:01,940
 She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will

159
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,340
 save his people from their sins."

160
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:12,700
 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet, "The virgin

161
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:20,420
 will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel, which means God

162
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,900
 with us."

163
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,180
 When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary

164
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,580
 home as his wife.

165
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,940
 But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son, and he gave him the

166
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,140
 name Jesus.

167
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:51,580
 Matthew 1 verses 16 and 18 make it clear that Jesus Christ's birth was different from

168
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:59,180
 that of any other Jewish boy named in the genealogy.

169
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:06,460
 Matthew pointed out that Joseph did not physically father Jesus Christ.

170
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:15,620
 Rather, that Joseph was the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is the Christ.

171
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:27,140
 Jesus was born of an earthly mother, without the need for an earthly father.

172
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:37,260
 By a miracle of the Holy Spirit, Jesus was conceived in the womb of Mary, who is a virgin.

173
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:45,420
 Both Mary and Joseph belonged to the house of David.

174
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,460
 Look at the Old Testament prophecies.

175
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:54,140
 They indicated that the Messiah would be born of a woman, of the seed of Abraham, through

176
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:03,300
 the tribe of Judah, and of the family of David.

177
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:10,700
 The king then was a Jewish male who is also the divine son of God.

178
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:16,980
 But did anybody acknowledge his kingship?

179
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,140
 Yes!

180
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,980
 And it came in a surprise package.

181
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:29,860
 The Magi from the East came and worshipped him.

182
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:36,900
 Now, Mount Matthew also makes no reference in his Gospel to a stable, a manger, shepherds

183
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,780
 or donkeys.

184
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:50,980
 He simply says the Magi came to the house after their fateful visit to Herod in Jerusalem.

185
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:58,140
 Let's take a look at that, as we look at the homage to the king.

186
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:04,700
 After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the

187
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:12,780
 East came to Jerusalem and asked, "Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews?"

188
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,260
 We saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him.

189
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:25,540
 When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.

190
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,620
 When he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he

191
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,420
 asked them where the Messiah was to be born.

192
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:39,940
 "In Bethlehem in Judea," they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written.

193
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:46,060
 But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of

194
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:52,860
 Judah, for out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel."

195
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,460
 Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had

196
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,460
 appeared.

197
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,480
 He sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and search carefully for the child.

198
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:11,980
 As soon as you find him, report to me so that I too may go and worship him."

199
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,640
 After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen when

200
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,160
 it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.

201
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,760
 When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.

202
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,380
 On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down

203
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,740
 and worshipped him.

204
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:42,100
 Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and

205
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
 myrrh.

206
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:49,300
 And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country

207
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,020
 by another route.

208
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,100
 Now we must confess that we know little about these men.

209
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:04,420
 The word translated "wise men" or "Magi" refers to a group of scholars who studied the stars.

210
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:11,580
 Their title connects them with magic, but they were probably more like astrologers.

211
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:18,660
 God gave them a special sign, a miraculous star that announced the birth of the king.

212
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:24,420
 The star led them to Jerusalem where God's prophets told them that the king would be

213
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,880
 born in Bethlehem.

214
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:35,220
 They went to Bethlehem and there they worshipped the Christ child.

215
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,180
 Now actually we don't know how many Magi there were.

216
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:44,540
 From the three gifts listed in Matthew 2, some people have assumed, and don't we sing

217
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,660
 don't we, "We three kings of Aurelian Tower."

218
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,420
 Though this is not certain.

219
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:59,500
 But please keep in mind, these men were Gentiles, not Jews.

220
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,420
 From the very beginning, Jesus came to be the savior of the world.

221
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,820
 The Magi were seeking the king, but Herod was afraid of the king and wanted to destroy

222
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,580
 him.

223
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:21,380
 This was Herod the Great, called "King" by the Roman Senate.

224
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:31,020
 Herod was a cruel and crafty man who permitted no one, not even his own family, to interfere

225
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,300
 with his rule or prevent him from satisfying his evil desires.

226
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,460
 He was a ruthless murderer.

227
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:45,900
 He killed his own wife and her two brothers were slain because he suspected them of treason.

228
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:53,500
 He was married at least nine times in order to fulfill his lusts and strengthen his particular

229
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,980
 ties.

230
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:02,860
 It is no surprise that Herod tried to kill Jesus.

231
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:11,300
 For Herod alone wanted to bear the title, "The King of the Jews."

232
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,780
 The Magi were seeking the king.

233
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,140
 Herod was opposing the king.

234
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,180
 And the Jewish priests were ignoring the king.

235
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:30,820
 These priests knew the scriptures and pointed others to the savior, but they would not go

236
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,080
 and worship him themselves.

237
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,220
 They quoted Micah 5.2 but did not obey him.

238
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:45,860
 They were five miles away from the Son of God, yet they did not go to see him.

239
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:55,820
 The Gentiles sought and found him, but the Jews did not.

240
00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:06,100
 Matthew cites a second fulfilled prophecy to prove that Jesus Christ is the King.

241
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:13,260
 In Bethlehem in Judea they replied, "For this is what the prophet has written."

242
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,460
 Quoting directly Micah 5.2.

243
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,780
 That's interesting isn't it?

244
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,940
 Matthew 2.5 and Micah 5.2.

245
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,820
 How he was born was a fulfillment of prophecy.

246
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,700
 And where he was born was a fulfillment of prophecy.

247
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,460
 Bethlehem literally means a house of bread.

248
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:45,700
 And this is where the bread of life came to earth.

249
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:53,380
 But there was hostility against the king.

250
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,620
 Let's watch it.

251
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:01,780
 When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream.

252
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:08,540
 "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt.

253
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:15,340
 Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."

254
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:20,780
 So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where

255
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,820
 he stayed until the death of Herod.

256
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:30,380
 And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet, "Out of Egypt I call

257
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,580
 my son."

258
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,100
 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious.

259
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:43,860
 And he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years

260
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:49,300
 old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.

261
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,420
 Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled.

262
00:26:53,420 --> 00:27:00,100
 A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children

263
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:08,340
 and refusing to be comforted because they are no more.

264
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:16,940
 A person is not only identified by his friends, but also by his enemies.

265
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:23,380
 Herod pretended that he wanted to worship the newborn king, Matthew 2.8, when in reality

266
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,700
 he wanted to destroy him.

267
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,460
 God warned Joseph to take the child of Mary and flee to Egypt.

268
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,380
 Egypt was close.

269
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,260
 There were many Jews there and the treasures received from the Magi would more than pay

270
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:43,620
 the expenses for traveling and live there.

271
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,220
 Herod's anger was evidence of his pride.

272
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:58,820
 He could not permit anyone to get the better of him, particularly some Gentile scholars.

273
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:07,700
 This led him to kill the boy babies two years of age and under who were still in Bethlehem.

274
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:19,060
 Matthew introduced here the theme of hostility, which he focused on throughout his book.

275
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:26,900
 Satan is a liar and a murderer, as was King Herod.

276
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
 He lied to the Magi.

277
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,420
 He murdered the babies.

278
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:41,340
 But Matthew 2.17-18 tells us that even this horrendous crime of murder was itself a fulfillment

279
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,540
 of Old Testament prophecy.

280
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:55,420
 But I'd like to finish on something which has puzzled me ever since I started singing

281
00:28:55,420 --> 00:29:01,500
 a song in the 90s called "The Humble King".

282
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:09,660
 When I first heard about it, the humble king seemed like an oxymoron.

283
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,540
 Let's watch the next few verses.

284
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:20,140
 After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, "Get

285
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:26,340
 up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying

286
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,340
 to take the child's life are dead."

287
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:37,660
 So he got up, took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.

288
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:43,260
 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father Herod, he

289
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,380
 was afraid to go there.

290
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,780
 Having been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee and he went and

291
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,540
 lived in a town called Nazareth.

292
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:00,500
 So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.

293
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:08,980
 The start of Matthew's Gospel contrasts Herod the Great with Jesus the Child.

294
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:14,820
 In a sense, this chapter could be called a tale of two kings.

295
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:26,420
 Ironically, Herod, the pompous, brutal, but phony king, seems to possess all the power.

296
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:36,140
 While Jesus, the vulnerable, the powerless, the humble king, actually is the King of Kings,

297
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:42,180
 who rules the heavens and the earth.

298
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:50,500
 In verse 23, Matthew intentionally quotes Jesus' hometown and says that he went and

299
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,780
 lived in a town called Nazareth.

300
00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:02,460
 So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.

301
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:10,940
 Nazareth is an off-the-map, politically insignificant place in the outpost of Galilee.

302
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,500
 It was despised by the people of that day.

303
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,820
 The name Jesus the Nazarene meant Jesus the lowly nobody.

304
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:29,340
 Even on the cross, he was called Jesus of Nazareth.

305
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:39,580
 So today, we have had Jesus the King linked with a dirty, smelly stable in a town called

306
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,100
 Bethlehem.

307
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:48,420
 Its only claim to fame, apparently, was it was the town of David.

308
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,460
 And we've had a hick town called Nazareth.

309
00:31:52,460 --> 00:32:00,820
 Archaeological research says that in Jesus' day, probably only 120 to 150 people lived

310
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,740
 in Nazareth.

311
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:06,740
 That's like our congregation on a normal day.

312
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:18,700
 In John 1, 46, Nathanael asked the famous question, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"

313
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:26,940
 This tiny farming village, high on a hill and far from the main trade routes, was the

314
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:34,940
 last place that anyone would want to look for the Messiah of Israel.

315
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,180
 Who ever heard of a king being born in a humble village?

316
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:49,060
 A place of violence and grief and growing up in a despised city?

317
00:32:49,060 --> 00:33:02,380
 The humility of the king is something for us to admire and to imitate.

318
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:11,180
 I want to leave us now with the thought that the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the

319
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:25,620
 Almighty God comes to us in the most humble of packages.

320
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:37,300
 Let us reflect on this as we watch and we listen to the song that I was referring to,

321
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
 The Humble King.

322
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:51,100
 Oh, kneel me down again Here at your feet

323
00:33:51,100 --> 00:34:12,020
 Show me how much you love humility Oh, Spirit be the star that leads me to

324
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:28,700
 The humble heart of love I see in you You are the God of the humble

325
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:38,140
 Friend of the weak You wash the feet of the weary

326
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:48,060
 Embrace the ones in need I want to be like you, Jesus

327
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:57,580
 To have this heart in me You are the God of the humble

328
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:08,460
 You are the humble king Here in this dusty ground

329
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:18,100
 I bow with kings Where wise men lay before

330
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:27,580
 Their offerings I lay no golden crown

331
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:36,820
 Here at your feet Just this, my broken life

332
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:47,860
 I offer thee See, you are the God of the humble

333
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:56,860
 Friend of the weak You wash the feet of the weary

334
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:06,180
 Embrace the ones in need I want to be like you, Jesus

335
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:15,260
 To have this heart in me You are the God of the humble

336
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:25,940
 You are the humble king You are the God of the humble

337
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:35,540
 Friend of the weak You wash the feet of the weary

338
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:43,020
 Embrace the ones in need I want to be like you, Jesus

339
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:53,780
 To have this heart in me You are the God of the humble

340
00:36:53,780 --> 00:37:05,940
 You are the humble king You are the God of the humble

341
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:13,380
 You are the humble king

342
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:44,100
 As you meet with your family or your friends or even as you're at home on your own listening

343
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:50,140
 to this, I want to give you a couple of things to reflect on.

344
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,620
 If you're in a group, good things to talk about.

345
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:01,900
 If you're on your own, just reflect on your answers to these questions.

346
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:13,580
 Firstly, how important to your faith is it to regard Jesus as a king?

347
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:26,380
 Secondly, compare the type of king Jesus was to Herod the Great.

348
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:39,820
 And thirdly, how does the humble king challenge you to live your life differently?

349
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:47,460
 Father God, I just pray for each one of us today as we reflect on this amazing tale of

350
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:56,260
 your birth, of your kingship, but Lord, how we are led to your humility.

351
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:03,820
 And I just pray today you'll help us to live lives that reflect your son Jesus.

352
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,620
 Amen.

353
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:13,260
