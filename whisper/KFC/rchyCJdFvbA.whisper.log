[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   - Well, thanks so much, Pastor John.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:14.820]   I was so impressed when I heard that you were doing a sermon series on serving and really
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.320]   thinking intentionally for almost two months about how you can serve the community.
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.120]   And I was especially grateful to John for giving me the invitation because serving the
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.360]   community is truly at the heart of Mother's Choice.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.400]   And that's because when I think about that more than 30 years ago, when my parents and
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.600]   their friends from our church, the same church where Pastor John prayed for me all those
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.280]   decades ago, they started Mother's Choice and it's really, they were just volunteers,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.760]   just regular people in the community.
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.520]   Nobody really had a professional background, but they were just people in our church family
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.000]   who wanted to respond to the deep need in our city of babies and children who don't
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.360]   have families and pregnant teenagers.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:23.680]   And now 36 years after the start of Mother's Choice, we have an average of 900 volunteers
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.160]   a month, and they're mostly people from our church community, including people who are
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.200]   in this room tonight.
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.640]   I'm so touched to see you here.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.960]   So I just want to say, I think that there's a movement.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.760]   There's something happening here in our city where people want to care about the lonely
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.340]   and the vulnerable.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.120]   And I have seen firsthand the power of serving the community.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.000]   And I think for us as Christians, it's more than just something powerful.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.920]   It's actually our calling.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.120]   I'm so blown away to hear those young people speak out the words from Jesus himself, that
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.640]   this is what our calling is.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.640]   This is our purpose.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.760]   This is why we're here on the planet.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.560]   But I think it takes something for us to pause, and that's really what you've been doing through
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.760]   this series, to ask ourselves the question, how do we actually serve our community?
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.880]   And if you remember one thing that I tell you tonight, I want you to remember this.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.000]   Serving our community looks like family.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.600]   So I'm not going to speak too long tonight.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.680]   I'm mostly just going to tell you some stories.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.040]   But I want to break that simple sentence down.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.600]   And I'm going to start with the word serving first.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.640]   What does it actually mean to serve?
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.720]   If you look it up in the dictionary, of course, it says it means to work for, to do good for,
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.200]   to help.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.800]   And the Bible tells us, and you can see this verse from the Gospel of Mark, but the Bible
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.440]   tells us that we are called to serve one another.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.640]   To work for, to do good for, to help others, not just ourselves.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:28.040]   Now, I'm talking about serving the family, and you can see behind me here in a moment,
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.080]   this is my family.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.480]   That's right.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.120]   It's a little bit unusual in Hong Kong, but believe it or not, I was born and raised right
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.720]   here in Hong Kong in a family of seven children.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.640]   And now I have seven children.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.240]   But I have six boys and one baby girl.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.280]   And speaking of serving and family, I was just really touched.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.320]   I think God has a sense of humor that the Cambodia youth mission trip, we're here sharing
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.560]   their testimony today.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:13.220]   Because just a few weeks ago, I agreed to go on my own church's youth and family service
[00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.400]   trip to the Philippines with my oldest son, Paxton.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:24.200]   Now he's 12 and a half, and he really, really wanted me to go with him.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:34.160]   The challenge was, and I'm being really open with you here, I really didn't want to go.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.000]   I did not want to go on the youth mission trip to serve others.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.640]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.760]   Things have been hard for me.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.720]   And I have a feeling they've probably been hard for some of you in this room too.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.600]   Now especially for me where I work, I work at Mother's Choice.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.720]   And the reality is the last couple of years, it's been three years since the last time
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.400]   I preached here at KFCI.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.160]   But the last three years have been really hard years.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.640]   And the reality is that Hong Kong, even though the COVID restrictions have been lifted, Hong
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.720]   Kong is actually facing a child protection crisis.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.360]   And our work serving children and pregnant teenagers has never been more difficult.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.480]   And if I'm being really open with you, I've been feeling really tired and maybe even a
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.440]   little burned out and discouraged.
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.240]   And feeling like does our work, does our service even make a difference?
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.960]   But I knew, my son who's about to become a teenager, I knew that this was really important
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.960]   to him.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.520]   It's a pivotal time in his life.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.680]   And I knew that I needed to say yes.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.760]   So I said yes, but another true confession here, I didn't read the bulletin that said
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.600]   where we were going or what we were doing.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.000]   I just, my son kept telling me to send the money in.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.720]   So I wrote the check.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.280]   I signed the permission slip.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.360]   I sent photocopies of our passport.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.640]   And I didn't actually know where really we were going in the Philippines or what we were
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.680]   going to be doing there.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.960]   So we got there late at night, the week of Easter, and it was too late to get any details.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.800]   And we woke up first thing in the morning.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.200]   And we had a big team meeting.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.640]   There were 38 people from our church.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:32.240]   And they talked about the ministry, where we were serving, and all the different projects
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.360]   that we could get involved with serving alongside the local community.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   So they described it.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:44.320]   They said they had a home for pregnant teenagers and women who had been abused and who'd fallen
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.680]   pregnant.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.220]   They had a children's home for babies and children who don't have families.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.200]   They had a school and a feeding program for underprivileged children.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.960]   And they had a maternal and child health clinic.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.160]   My heart sunk.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:11.320]   I had just taken a precious week of annual leave to go to the Philippines and volunteer
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.880]   at an organization that does almost the exact same thing that I do every day here in Hong
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880]   Kong.
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.540]   I was like, "Oh, do I really have to do this, Lord?
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.740]   I love this work, but I need a break.
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.740]   I need a vacation.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.700]   And here I am doing the exact same thing."
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:36.100]   Then they went on to describe the projects where we could be volunteering.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.360]   And they said you could cement stucco.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.780]   They were trying to build more rooms in the school.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.280]   You could do cement stucco.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.620]   You could lay sod in the garden outside the children's home.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.560]   You could paint the nursery.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:56.220]   They even had an opportunity to volunteer in the clinic, helping to deliver babies and
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.500]   look after the newborns who came in for their well baby checks.
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.580]   And I tell you, I'm so happy seeing your beautiful baby there in the back because, I mean, obviously
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.100]   with seven kids and working at Mother's Choice, I love babies.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:15.420]   But the reality is I was there with my 12-year-old son who had no interest in going to the clinic.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:23.980]   And so I found myself doing basically manual labor in the heat of the Philippine sun.
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:26.380]   And I didn't say anything out loud.
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.620]   Of course, I was there with the youth group and a parent volunteer.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.980]   So I kept a smile on my face.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.180]   But inside, I was pretty grumpy.
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.780]   I had a bad attitude.
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.180]   I was like, "Why am I doing this on my vacation?"
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:47.620]   And every evening, we would gather together with other teams from our church and they
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.100]   would talk about what they did.
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.180]   And the ladies who had come with their daughters had all been in the clinic and they were delivering
[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.300]   three to four babies a day.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.980]   And can you imagine, a teenager in Hong Kong doesn't get the chance to deliver a baby in
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.980]   the hospital.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.620]   So they were all so impressed.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:04.780]   They thought it was amazing.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:10.420]   And they kept saying, "Aliya, you really need to meet the head midwife.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.420]   She's incredible.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.740]   She's like an army general.
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:18.700]   She tells everybody what to do and where to go.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.580]   She creates like a gentle birthing environment for the women who've been through a lot of
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:23.580]   trauma.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.580]   She's amazing.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.660]   She's going to really be impressed meeting you because you've delivered seven kids."
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.260]   So I said, "Yeah, yeah, I'd love to meet her."
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:36.740]   And with the second to the last night, I am getting ready for dinner.
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.220]   And one of the other moms sees me and says, "I see her.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.420]   She's down in the dining room.
[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.300]   You got to come and meet her.
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.260]   Her name's Rona."
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:50.340]   So I come along and I see Rona and I say, "Hello."
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.100]   And the lady from my church says, "Rona, please meet Aliya.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:58.460]   She's one of the volunteer moms from the Hong Kong mission trip.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.540]   And actually, she runs a very similar organization in Hong Kong called Mother's Choice.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.760]   You're going to love meeting her because she has..."
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.540]   And she doesn't even get the word seven kids out of her mouth because the woman suddenly
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.100]   bursts into tears.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.060]   I mean, really crying.
[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:17.700]   She's hyperventilating.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:18.700]   She's mumbling.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:19.780]   She's almost screaming.
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:21.180]   I couldn't really...
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.140]   I thought she was having a heart attack.
[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:27.780]   So I'm like looking around to see if they have a defibrillator.
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.540]   Eventually she calms down enough and I hear the words that she's saying.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.740]   She's like, "2005, 2005, was it you?
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.740]   Was it you?
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.260]   I've been trying to recard all these years.
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.260]   Was it you?"
[00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.660]   And finally I said, "What?
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.300]   I don't think I've ever met you before.
[00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.860]   Are you trying to say that you visited Mother's Choice in 2005?
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.860]   Definitely wasn't me.
[00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.940]   Maybe Gretchen, maybe Kit Ying, maybe somebody else from our team.
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.080]   Why?"
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.940]   And she proceeded to tell me the story.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.100]   She said, "I was a domestic worker in Hong Kong."
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.740]   And she didn't tell me what happened, but it was pretty clear from how she said it.
[00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:13.100]   She said, "I experienced extreme trauma.
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.220]   And as a result, I was pregnant."
[00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.740]   She said, "I didn't know what to do.
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.380]   I was so upset.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.860]   And she's a medical professional.
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.860]   She's a nurse.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.860]   She's a nurse and midwife."
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:32.900]   So she said, "She tried to terminate the pregnancy herself five times and it didn't work."
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.760]   She said she was so depressed she would go on the street and see cigarettes and put them
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.020]   out on her arms.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:43.540]   She eventually went to the top of her building where she decided that she was going to jump
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.540]   off.
[00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.560]   But she said she felt someone, something stop her.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.460]   Eventually it came time for her to deliver her baby and she went to the hospital and
[00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.940]   she said, "I still remember the name of the doctor.
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.940]   Dr. Ma.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.860]   Hope one day I get to meet him."
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:06.580]   And he gave her a scan and he said, "Miss, you're going to have this baby.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.580]   But I need to tell you that this baby has some very serious medical conditions."
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:16.360]   I don't know if it was a result of what had happened, but he said, "This baby needs serious
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.360]   medical intervention."
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.340]   And she said she just started weeping because she thought, "I can't stay here in Hong Kong
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:28.700]   where this thing has happened to me, but how can I go back to my home country with this
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.820]   baby who's going to need medical care?
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.260]   I don't have the support for that."
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:40.340]   And the doctor looked at her and he said, "I know a place here in Hong Kong that takes
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:46.060]   really good care of babies and they find families for those babies.
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.500]   I'll take you there."
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.860]   Now she said, "That was 2005.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.980]   I brought the baby to Mother's Choice and you guys took the baby, but you know you can't
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.980]   sign off on adoption right away in Hong Kong.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.180]   It takes quite a long time period."
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:06.580]   So she went back and about two weeks had gone by and she said she just cried every day and
[00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.260]   every night and she couldn't leave the little boy, who she called Joseph, behind.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.020]   So she came back to Mother's Choice after two weeks and said she wanted her baby back.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:19.020]   And of course, they gave the baby back to her.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.900]   And she said, "I went back to the Philippines."
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:28.380]   She said, "But that was the same year that the ministry where I was volunteering was
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.460]   started."
[00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:35.180]   And she said, "Because of what you did for me in my moment of extreme need," she said,
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:41.900]   "I decided to become their head midwife and now I have delivered 4,000 babies from pregnant
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:46.420]   teenagers and women who've been through trauma like me."
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:51.100]   And I started to cry because I thought, "God, I had such a bad attitude.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.100]   I didn't want to come here to serve.
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:14:01.420]   I felt like what we were doing, this manual labor, is worthless and I feel discouraged
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:05.940]   back in my work at home in Hong Kong."
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:11.480]   I thought I was going to the Philippines for my son, but I think God had me choose to go
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:15.100]   on that service trip with my church for me.
[00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.780]   It was a divine appointment because I'll tell you, Mother's Choice looked after that baby
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.780]   for two weeks.
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.740]   It wouldn't have even been in our impact report.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.460]   We wouldn't have even counted it in our numbers.
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.100]   We would have felt like we didn't really do anything.
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:35.380]   But because whoever were the volunteers at that time said yes to serving, to volunteering,
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:42.180]   and that doctor, that woman has gone to another country and saved 4,000 children.
[00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:50.860]   And I thought, "God, you're reminding me that we are called, we are called to serve others."
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:56.900]   And when we serve others like Dr. Ma and those volunteers at Mother's Choice 18 years ago,
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:00.820]   God multiplies our impact.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:06.620]   And when we choose to serve others like I very reluctantly chose to do with Paxton,
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:14.460]   we can receive too because I received an encouragement that God knew that I needed.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:21.880]   So we know that serving is really important, but why do we serve our community?
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:28.980]   So next I just want to unpack the importance of relationship and community.
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:35.220]   Now the Bible says, and this is one of my favorite verses, "Two really are better than
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.900]   one."
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.620]   We are built to be in relationship.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:45.140]   Nobody, not one of you, not me, and not any single one of you in this room, you cannot
[00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.900]   go through life alone.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.380]   We need each other.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:58.620]   And when we serve, as I said, we're called to serve, we need to serve relationally.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:06.020]   We need to become community for the lonely now more than ever in Hong Kong.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:11.860]   Because I actually believe that this is a pivotal moment in Hong Kong history.
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.860]   We're at an inflection point and it's not just in Hong Kong, I believe it's around the
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.860]   world.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:22.260]   I believe that people will look back on this time and say everything changed.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:28.060]   And over the last few years, what we've seen happening in Hong Kong, and even since the
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:35.300]   last time I came here to preach, we've seen a huge rise in social isolation.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:40.620]   That was exacerbated by the social unrest and by COVID restrictions.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:46.660]   But even now that we're all online, we have church online, we have online school, we can
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:53.620]   do everything online, we've actually become much less connected as a community.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:17:00.940]   And without community support, without people having deeper relationships with friends,
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:08.300]   with family, even with their faith community, we have seen more marriages break down.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.180]   We have seen more mental health problems.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:15.940]   I'm really blown away that you guys were doing Restore, it's so needed right now.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:21.360]   We are seeing, as people are experiencing more financial stress, we've also seen a huge
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:25.580]   increase in Hong Kong in substance abuse.
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:31.180]   Now all of this isolation and people going through all these problems without having
[00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:37.180]   people who can speak into their lives to support them, all of that has made families a lot
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.020]   more vulnerable.
[00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:44.160]   And that has led to this child protection crisis that I was telling you, we have never
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.540]   seen anything like it in Hong Kong's history before.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:53.440]   We have more child abuse, more child neglect, more child abandonment.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.520]   And the reality is there's actually tens of thousands of families right now that are very
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.360]   socially isolated where their children are at very high risk, and 4,000 children living
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.800]   in full-time residential care.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.300]   I mean, we're really at a breaking point.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.160]   And I think you just need to pick up the newspaper any day of the week here in Hong Kong to recognize
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.780]   what's happening.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.120]   Now the challenge for me, and this is what we see at Mother's Choice, of the children
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.720]   who enter into residential care in Hong Kong, most of them never leave.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.280]   They spend most of their childhoods without a family.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:31.280]   And I love, is it Elizabeth, the missionary from Cambodia?
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:36.440]   Babies without somebody to look after them die.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.760]   You children need family.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:44.440]   And so the longer children stay without that permanent legal family who love them, who
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.880]   look after them, even if they have food, even if they have a roof over their head, even
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.000]   if they have school, they're more likely to have physical and mental health problems.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   They're more likely to do drugs.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.280]   They're more likely to drop out of school.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.060]   They're more likely to go to prison.
[00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:01.040]   And of course, if they're a girl, they're the most likely to get pregnant between the
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.320]   ages of 12 and 25.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:09.280]   And then of course, if you're a pregnant teenager without a family, your child is very likely
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.760]   to end up in the residential care system.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.120]   And the cycle begins again.
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.720]   So it's a vicious cycle.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.760]   But I'm standing here today with great hope.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.000]   I'm not depressed, even though I was crying in the last song.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.520]   Because I want to tell you that there's actually something that is so much more powerful than
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.080]   this vicious cycle.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.400]   There's something that breaks it.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.680]   And that is family.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:47.640]   But the reality is no family, not my family, not your family, no family can do it on their
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.160]   own.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.200]   Families need to be supported by their community.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.480]   Families in this church need to be supported by their community.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:04.600]   And that's why since I was last here, even with all the uncertainty and challenge of
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.680]   COVID, we actually started safe families.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:15.120]   And that's because we were seeing so many young single mothers who wanted to parent
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.600]   their children.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.440]   And actually, there are programs and there are things to support those women in Hong
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.440]   Kong.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.120]   But they were struggling to even access or go to those programs or to receive those supports.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.280]   And that's because they didn't have relationship.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.800]   They didn't have anybody who could watch their child when they needed a break or need to
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.800]   go shopping.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:40.720]   They didn't have anybody to talk through their problems or nobody to be their mentor or to
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.720]   be their role model.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.360]   They didn't have any community.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.440]   So that's why we started safe families.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:54.400]   And it's not something, it's not the same as becoming a foster parent or becoming an
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.760]   adoptive parent.
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:01.320]   Safe families is saying, I want to be community to a young single mom and her child and want
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.880]   to become an extended family.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:09.000]   And actually, I was so blown away to see one of our safe, amazing stars, single mom, safe
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.720]   family volunteers here in the front row.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.120]   But I just want to tell you, what does it really mean to be community?
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.720]   I want to share two stories with you, two real stories that happened since I was last
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.400]   here and we started safe families.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.360]   There was one girl, I was really moved by her story because she called her safe family
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.320]   volunteer crying, saying that she wanted to place her child into the orphanage and foster
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.760]   care system in Hong Kong.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.960]   And her safe families volunteer was really upset.
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:42.520]   She drove over and went to her apartment and said, "Why do you want to place your child
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.520]   in the system?
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.840]   I thought you really wanted to take care of your baby.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   What's wrong?"
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:50.280]   And she said, she was weeping, "I'm a terrible mother.
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.760]   I can't take care of this baby.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.480]   I'm a terrible mother."
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.360]   And she said, "Why do you, you're an amazing mom.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.520]   Why do you think you're a terrible mother?"
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.320]   She said, "Look at my baby."
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.680]   And the baby had scratches on his face.
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:10.160]   And she said, "Oh," she said, "the baby keeps scratching his face and now the baby's face
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.740]   is bleeding."
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:17.920]   And her safe family friend, you know, who's an experienced mom said, "Oh, sweetheart,
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.920]   that's normal.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.480]   You know, babies can't control their hands for the first few months.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.720]   Their nails grow real sharp.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.960]   You have to cut their nails.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.920]   But you know, that's normal.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.760]   You just put, you can put the mittens on the baby's hands.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   It's not a big deal."
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:34.160]   And she was crying, "I don't have any mittens."
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.120]   And she said, "Do you have socks for the baby?"
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.440]   She said, "Yes, we'll put the socks on the baby's hands.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.440]   It's okay."
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:45.480]   You know, but I'm just telling you that, you know, even though she had housing, even though
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.000]   she didn't have the strength to mother without community.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.120]   And sometimes being community, it doesn't matter if you're single, if you're young or
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.040]   if you're older, if you're married or you're, it doesn't matter.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.720]   You all have something to offer.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:06.080]   Another young girl's story who really impacted me and showed me the power of community is
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.040]   it was somebody from our wider church network here who agreed to be a friend.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.420]   She said, "Look, I don't want to take care of your baby.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.760]   But what I will do is I want to be the one, I'm going to drive you."
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:22.320]   Her baby was born a little bit sick and had to go to the MCHC, to the clinic, you know,
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   every couple of weeks.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:24.580]   She said, "I will bring you.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.140]   I have a driver.
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.760]   I'll go with, in my car, I'll bring my car, I'll pick you up.
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.320]   I'm going to take you to the clinic because even if you have an appointment, you know,
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.960]   you got to wait there like two, three hours, right?"
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:40.800]   And so she came to visit us after the baby hit, I think, two months old.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.560]   She came back to Mother's Choice to visit us.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.820]   And our housemother said, "How are you doing?"
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.020]   And she was crying again.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.380]   She said, "Why are you crying?"
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.100]   And she said, "I'm just so touched."
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:56.160]   She said, "Even my mother, my boyfriend, not one of them has ever taken me to the hospital
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.460]   or came to visit me in the hospital."
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.740]   And this lady from the church who didn't feel like she could do anything, but she had a
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.940]   driver and could take her to her appointments, you know, she felt so loved.
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.540]   She experienced the power of community.
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.100]   And so I want to tell you this about community.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:15.180]   Community isn't about being a superhero, okay?
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.620]   You don't have to be a professional social worker or something like that.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:24.580]   You just need to be someone's friend.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.200]   You just need to be in relationship.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.600]   That's what it means to be community.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.820]   The God that we serve is a really good Father.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:40.860]   And He's actually the author and designer of family.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:44.580]   And family is really important to Him.
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:50.900]   In fact, the Bible tells us that He is the Father to the fatherless.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.460]   He's the defender of widows.
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:58.420]   And He is the one who sets the lonely in families.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:04.940]   And I believe that part of our mission and our calling to serving the community as a
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:11.020]   church is not only to be community for families that are vulnerable and struggling, but we
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:17.220]   are actually called to be family for those who don't have a family at all.
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.620]   And the truth is, family is not just blood, right?
[00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:26.100]   It's not just the people who we have a DNA connection with.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:31.340]   And I really believe that it's important for us in the church in Hong Kong to redefine
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.620]   what family means.
[00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:38.180]   I love this quote from Mother Teresa, because she said that the problem with the world is
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.260]   that we draw the circle of our family.
[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:45.300]   That means we define who our family is far too small.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:50.300]   Because I think the reality is that family isn't DNA.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:53.500]   Family is love and commitment, right?
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.140]   Because so what I tell my kids when I'm trying to tell them what does it mean to be in our
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:01.380]   family, I say, "Family sticks together."
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.380]   Okay?
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.340]   Family forgives each other.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:13.100]   Family we see the best in each other, and we walk through the worst with each other.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.900]   Family tells you that you're never going to be alone.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:27.940]   There are so many who are alone right here in Hong Kong.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.580]   I want to tell you the story of a little boy.
[00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.980]   It was actually a man on a bicycle who found him.
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:41.820]   He was a newborn baby, and he was left by the footbridge off the highway in Tai Po.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:47.780]   The man on the bicycle saw the package moving, realized it was a baby, and he called the
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.600]   police.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.860]   The police actually got there pretty quickly, and it was immediately obvious to them that
[00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.980]   the baby had very serious medical needs.
[00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:02.580]   And so they called an ambulance, and he was sent to the hospital.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:08.140]   His condition was so severe that he actually spent 17 months in two different hospitals
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.860]   here in Hong Kong.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:16.540]   And it was after 17 months that we got the call, and that was almost exactly 10 years
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.420]   ago, 2013.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:26.380]   I was just one year into my new role as CEO of Mother's Choice.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.060]   I tell you, I got that phone call, and I was terrified.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:31.060]   I was really scared.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.780]   And actually, all of us were.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.180]   Could we care for a baby with this severe medical needs?
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.500]   Would we ever be able to find him a family?
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.700]   Because we don't want to keep kids with us permanently.
[00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.340]   We're trying to aim to get them to be adopted or to go back to their birth families.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:51.660]   And the truth is, with his medical diagnosis, we even wondered, would he even live long
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.220]   enough to be able to find a family?
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.700]   But even though we were scared, we said yes.
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.500]   And I'm so glad that we did.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:08.900]   In 2015, we actually found an adoptive family for Nolan.
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.540]   That's what they called him in the United States.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.100]   And they totally fell in love with him.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:20.900]   And they were so blown away by his capacity for love.
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.300]   And I think that's really something that he learned from our local volunteers here in
[00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:30.700]   our child care home, who loved him and cared for him so tenderly.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:38.140]   And so they actually determined that they wanted to adopt another little boy who had
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.580]   been Nolan's best friend in our child care home.
[00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:48.840]   Now Francis was blind and had some other medical needs and was eight years old by the time
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.900]   Nolan legally became his brother.
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:57.800]   But he got to experience what it meant to be loved and to join a family.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:04.600]   And then just last year, at the height of our COVID restrictions and all the challenges
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:11.820]   we were having here in Hong Kong, that same family was inspired to adopt their third child
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.060]   from Mother's Choice.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:18.740]   Now little Oakland was quadriplegic, just like Nolan.
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:26.460]   And honestly, if we had not had the courage to say yes to Nolan and then see him find
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.600]   a family, we wouldn't have had courage to say yes to her either.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:36.220]   And so I want to show you their story because God designed for them to be in family.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:52.220]   So let's go.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:59.220]   [MUSIC]
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:07.220]   [MUSIC]

[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:54.220]   [MUSIC]
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:59.220]   When we began our journey with Nolan, it was heavy on my heart that his story is more than
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.220]   just coming into our family.
[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:06.220]   We would always say, if nothing else, his story will encourage others to take that first
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.220]   step towards adoption.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.220]   And it did.
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.220]   Our story is not about us.
[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:18.220]   It really is about Nolan and that connection between him, Francis, and Oakland.
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:24.220]   Nolan also created a passion and avenue for me to help and encourage others to just go
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:30.220]   for it and for me to advocate for these kids in need.
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.220]   There are days when choosing joy is very hard.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:38.220]   Even on the hard days, though, I am the lucky one.
[00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:45.220]   Adoption is creating a family from broken places that all of us have and then putting it
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:52.220]   back together to make a picture more beautiful than we could have ever created on our own.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.220]   It's not about us or anything that we do special.
[00:32:56.220 --> 00:33:03.220]   It's simply that their stories do not have to end in an institution.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:14.220]   Our vision at Mother's Choice is every child, every child in the city of Hong Kong in a
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:16.220]   loving family.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:22.220]   And we know that that's the heart of our father God for this city, too.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:30.220]   And we believe that it's possible for our vision to become a reality in Hong Kong, in
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:37.220]   our nation of China, in our world, that every child can grow up knowing that they're safe,
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:41.220]   that they're loved, that they have a mother and a father.
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:43.220]   I'll tell you something.
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:49.220]   I believe that it's possible for Hong Kong to be the best place in the world to raise
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.220]   children.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.220]   I believe that people will no longer leave this city because they want to give their
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:34:00.220]   children a better life, but people will move to Hong Kong because this is the best place
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:04.220]   for their children to be raised.
[00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:13.220]   I know that this is a radical vision and sounds crazy when you read the newspapers, but I
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.220]   believe that it's possible.
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.220]   I want to tell you something.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:20.220]   It's going to take you.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.220]   It's going to take us.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.220]   It's going to take us, this is the church here in Hong Kong.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:27.220]   It's going to take us to saying yes.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:34.220]   We're going to start saying yes to serving, saying yes to being community for those who
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:40.220]   are lonely and isolated, and it's going to take us saying yes to being family.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:49.220]   The children like Nolan and Francis and Oakland could be adopted right here in Hong Kong.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:56.220]   Serving the community looks like family, and I want to tell you this as you go out to dinner
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:35:01.220]   tonight, as you go home, as you meet up with your friends, I want you to think about how
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:06.220]   you can serve, whether you sign up to give your time and your expertise to serve others,
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:12.220]   to go on the next mission trip to Cambodia, whether you volunteer at Mother's Choice
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:19.220]   Safe Families, become a foster parent, or you just show kindness to the lonely and the
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:22.220]   hurting who are right here in this room tonight.
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.220]   You know, you greet the person who you don't know.
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:29.220]   You offer to take somebody out for coffee or for lunch.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.220]   You visit somebody in the hospital.
[00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:36.220]   You invite, you see a single mom and you see if you can bring her kid to Sunday school
[00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:39.220]   or help her out.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:44.220]   Whether you decide to open your own home and heart as an adoptive family, and I believe
[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:49.220]   that there are people right here in this congregation who maybe not now, but maybe later, you could
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:52.220]   open your heart to adoption later.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:59.220]   I believe that when we decide at Gong Fook Church, the wider church here in Hong Kong,
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:05.220]   when we decide that we want to serve our community as family, that we are going to see our city,
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.220]   Hong Kong, transformed.
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:09.220]   So, thank you so much.
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:11.220]   Thanks so much for listening to me today.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:12.220]   God bless you.
