[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.120]   I'm excited about tonight.
[00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.600]   I get excited to teach.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:20.140]   I've been preaching for, gosh, probably 35 years, but I get so excited every time because
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.560]   I think anything could happen tonight.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.960]   Like literally anything.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.680]   I really believe when I talk to God, when I pray, like He literally hears me.
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.880]   The God who spoke the world into existence hears me.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.440]   And so tonight I was praying specifically saying, "God, can I please experience you?
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.780]   Can we all experience you?"
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.560]   And so as we go through His Word tonight, I'm just excited about what He might do.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.320]   I've been in Hong Kong for eight months now, and it's been one of the best seasons of our
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.660]   lives.
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.720]   We love it here.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.520]   I don't know, every season is so happy for me.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.680]   I love following God.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.480]   I love experiencing Him in new ways.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.700]   In fact, my wife who's with me, we've been married for 27 years now.
[00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.840]   We have seven children, two grandchildren.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.640]   And when we decided to move here from the US, we thought, "Okay, we'll take our four
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.020]   youngest children and move to Hong Kong."
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:55.560]   And then both of my son-in-laws prayed and sought the Lord, and they both said, "We believe
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.100]   God wants us to come with you."
[00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.920]   And so 12 of us moved to Hong Kong.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:14.280]   The 12 of us moved to Hong Kong in February, like in the middle of COVID and the protests,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.720]   and everyone in America thought we were crazy.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.560]   They go, "Why would you do that to your children?"
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.760]   And then we get here, and it's totally safe in Hong Kong, and it's crazy in America right
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   now.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.040]   Especially today, they're going to be killing each other.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.480]   I mean, it's just a way we've experienced God over the years.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:50.880]   I remember at our 25-year anniversary, at dinner I asked my wife, I said, "No, she asked
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.520]   me."
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:02.840]   She said, "Do you know of anyone on the earth that is happier than us?"
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.480]   And I said, "I don't.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   I don't know anyone."
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   And she goes, "I know."
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.840]   She goes, "I keep thinking there has to be someone on the earth that is more blessed
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.200]   than we are."
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.200]   But she goes, "I haven't met them yet."
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.920]   And I go, "That's exactly the way I think."
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.800]   It's so cool at 25 years of marriage to go, "I wouldn't trade this for anything."
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.280]   It's been an amazing life.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.720]   The way that we've seen God answer prayer.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.800]   There's no way our lives should have worked out this way.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.520]   So many times I'm just amazed, going, "God, you really heard me yesterday when I prayed
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.760]   that specifically."
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.260]   I mean, sometimes I am literally shaking, like so shocked at the way that He answers
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.100]   my prayers.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.760]   And so when I was praying for you today, I'm saying, "God, can I experience it again?
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.580]   Can you do something tonight?
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.160]   Something that I've never even experienced?
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.920]   Can we all experience you in some way?
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.560]   Can that fire come from heaven in some way to where some of you that maybe you've been
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.040]   going to church services your whole life for the first time, you're like, "I get it.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.800]   I love Him."
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:41.960]   Because something I've noticed being in Hong Kong, the people here are so hardworking.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.640]   They work so many hours and it's great.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:53.080]   I mean, when I need something done, this is the place to go.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:01.320]   Hong Kong people know how to get things done and how to work.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:11.560]   But sometimes the relationships aren't so strong between parents and children, husbands
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.720]   and wives.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:21.200]   And I've seen how sometimes that spills into the church, where you can be very good at
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.560]   obeying commands and even showing up to serve.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.240]   You know, if we need people to pass out rice, you'll show up.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.400]   If we need people to fold bulletins or do whatever all night, you'll show up, you'll
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.880]   do it.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.240]   And you'll come week after week.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.680]   But how is the relationship?
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.780]   Because I grew up in a Chinese Baptist church, you know?
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.000]   And so very, very similar.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.360]   Both of my parents were pastors in Hong Kong, both in the Baptist church.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:15.520]   And so when they went to the US, the idea was to start a church very similar to the
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.640]   Hong Kong church.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.000]   And so that's what I grew up in.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.640]   And so grateful, so thankful for some of the people in that church.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:32.480]   In fact, Simo, the pastor's wife, she still calls me.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.680]   This is 45 years later.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.160]   Simo still calls me.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.480]   In fact, she's like, "Don't move to Hong Kong."
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.480]   You know?
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   She goes, "Ning li Zhong Min mai gei hou.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   Mou buan la.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   Gei hou da sei ni."
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.840]   You know, she's just worried, like, "Don't go over there.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   Your Chinese is terrible.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.720]   You're going to say the wrong thing and someone's going to beat you up."
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   You know?
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   She goes, "Ning li Zhong Min mai gei hou.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   Mou buan la.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.720]   Gei hou da sei ni."
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   You know?
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   And she goes, "I can't help it."
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.480]   She goes, "I've been loving you for 40 years.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.600]   I can't just stop."
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.680]   And I think, "Wow, that's so beautiful.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.440]   So much that I'm thankful for."
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.200]   You know, but I saw so many of my friends that grew up in the same church and so many
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:25.360]   people that were in that same church and they're not following God anymore.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.080]   And they were very good at doing whatever the pastor told them to do and obey those
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.080]   rules.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.920]   But it's like it really wasn't in their own hearts.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.620]   They didn't really experience Him.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:47.560]   They know how to do Christian things, but did they really know God?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.480]   See, when I grew up, I didn't understand some of this book.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:02.120]   When I would read like, you know, the passages about God's holiness, I understood it.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.040]   And when I would read the commands, I understood them.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:15.160]   But then when I would read the Psalms, the Psalms were very confusing to me because I
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:21.900]   would read the way that David would talk to God and I go, "Wow, that's weird."
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:30.480]   Because for most of us growing up in a Chinese home, the relationship, especially with your
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.680]   father, you don't talk.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.400]   You just don't talk, right?
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:45.000]   I never, not even one time, had a conversation with, not one sentence of a conversation with
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.180]   my father.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.360]   I obeyed him.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:55.440]   I got the grades he told me to get because if I didn't get those grades, he would punish
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.600]   me severely.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.920]   I feared him.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.600]   I would try to honor him, but there's no relationship.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.040]   So then I read the Psalms and it talks about David going, "Oh, I just want you.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.600]   I just want to be with you.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.080]   This is the one thing I ask.
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.560]   Can I just stare at you?
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.660]   Oh, when can I, even when I'm in the desert and there's no water, all I want is you."
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:30.880]   And I would read those things and I just couldn't understand it because I grew up very Chinese.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:41.960]   And we understand commands and we will obey those commands, but these words about relationship
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:51.560]   and desire, especially with your authority, okay, your authority, and David's talking
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:57.440]   to God like he's his friend or his wife.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:04.360]   It's like these words, how can you use that for authority?
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:11.320]   Because authority and intimacy don't seem to go together.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:19.440]   But I would read that in the Bible and God over many, many, many years, even to this
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:32.000]   day, he's teaching me about love, teaching me about relationship, teaching me the enjoyment.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.760]   And it's not just David.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:40.240]   In the New Testament, you know, one of my favorite passages is in Philippians 1 when
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:50.280]   Paul says in verse 21, "For me to live is Christ and to die is gain."
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.880]   He's like, "My whole life is about Jesus.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.120]   And if I die, that'd be even better because I'd be even closer to him.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.240]   I could see him.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.360]   I want to be with him."
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:09.940]   Because a couple of verses later, he says, he goes, "I am hard-pressed between the two.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:19.760]   My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better."
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:26.360]   Paul goes, "Oh, I just want to leave this earth right now.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:33.920]   This would be so much better."
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.580]   Is that your desire tonight?
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.240]   Not because you're depressed, not because, you know, you're having a hard time, but because
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.320]   you're in love with the person of Jesus.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.320]   Is it like a real...is he a real person to you?
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:57.880]   You know, it's like when...you know, I'm so grateful for COVID because all the places
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.680]   I was supposed to travel, I got to say, "Sorry, you know, I can't go.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.400]   I have to stay here."
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.220]   But it's great because I don't want to go anywhere.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.480]   And every time I'm away from the family, I just travel every single week.
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:19.640]   And so every time I'm like, "Oh, I hate being away from my family.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.500]   And I can't wait to get home."
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.640]   That's the way Paul felt about Jesus.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:29.300]   He wasn't just this idea of some being up there.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.300]   He was a real person.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.500]   He's going, "God, this isn't enough.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.820]   I love praying to you, but I want to see you.
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.380]   I want to be with you.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.100]   You're the only one I want to be with.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.420]   So I would much rather leave the earth, all these people on the earth I love, for my one
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:51.220]   true love, for me to live is Christ."
[00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:57.980]   And I was thinking, "You know, I can explain this passage to you.
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.900]   I can teach it."
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:07.960]   But I'm saying, "God, I don't want this just to be a lesson."
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:20.080]   So I brought with me a menu of just different...it's a pastry shop, you know, different cakes.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:24.540]   And I can teach you the menu.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.460]   I say, "Oh, you got to try this cake.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.700]   Wow.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.860]   It's like...I don't know what's on there, okay?
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.900]   But I...because I can't read Chinese.
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:42.980]   But if I could, I could just read it for you and say, "Oh, this cake is made of this and
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.500]   this and this and this."
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.420]   You know, and you'll be there and go, "Wow, that sounds really good."
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.460]   Then I go, "Okay, you got to try this one, okay?
[00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.460]   This one is..."
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.780]   You know, and I explain every...
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.940]   Maybe I can explain it so well.
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:03.420]   See, this happens in a lot of churches.
[00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.900]   We open up the menu and we just start reading.
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.380]   And everyone's like, "Oh, that sounds good.
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:14.900]   That sounds really good.
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:21.060]   And maybe I've never tasted this, but I can still explain it to you.
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.220]   I can still be right.
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.780]   I can still be accurate."
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.380]   I say, "Wow, they have these egg tarts."
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:33.660]   You know, and I say, "Wow, look at this, you know, how they make them."
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:39.820]   And I can explain everything in an egg tart, how it's created, what it would taste like.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.100]   And you go, "Oh, that's good.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.100]   That's good.
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.100]   Thank you.
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.100]   Thank you.
[00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.460]   Next week, teach me about, you know, char siu bao.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.380]   You know, just teach me something else.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.380]   Oh, okay, that's good."
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:15:00.420]   And we learn and we pass on information and it's accurate.
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:06.060]   But my prayer, I actually brought some Dan Tat, okay?
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:12.460]   Now or I could go, "Wow, this is so good.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.860]   This is so awesome.
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:15.860]   Here, see how that...
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:16.860]   You want to try one?
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.700]   You want to try one?"
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.700]   This is what I prayed for.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.020]   I go, "God, I don't want to just talk about you.
[00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.820]   I want to be up here.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.540]   I want to experience you.
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.620]   I want to taste you."
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:39.860]   The Bible says, "Taste and see that the Lord is good."
[00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:44.940]   I always pray, "God, make me one of those pastors that's talking about you as I'm tasting
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.940]   you."
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.220]   You know, that I'm not just reading out a book.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.660]   That's fine.
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.820]   It's accurate.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.300]   But I want it in my mouth.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.940]   I want to taste it.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.740]   And I want you to taste it.
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.500]   I'm saying, "God, I can't make this happen.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:19.060]   I can't make you experience God and understand this relationship where it's real to you and
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.100]   He enters you and He becomes a part of you."
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.300]   And then you tell everyone.
[00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:31.460]   Then you've tasted and you tell everyone, "You've got to understand this relationship."
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:35.980]   Man, for me to live is Christ.
[00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.100]   I love Him so much.
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:43.540]   I just want to leave the earth right now because I can't get enough of Him.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.020]   That was Paul.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:53.660]   And I can explain to you how Paul felt, but that's not my desire.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:17:00.180]   I go, "God, I want them to feel what Paul felt.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.460]   I want them to experience what Paul experienced.
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:09.980]   I want you to taste and see and go, 'I really want to leave the earth right now because
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:18.380]   I'm so at peace with Jesus and I want more of Him.'"
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:28.380]   See I believe there are some of you here that all you've done is read the menu and you just
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.060]   look at it, the pictures, you go, "Yeah, I agree.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.060]   I agree.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.060]   I agree.
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:34.060]   I agree.
[00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.060]   That sounds good.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.820]   Oh, good.
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.020]   I can have peace beyond comprehension?
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.540]   I can have that much peace?
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.780]   I'd like to try that someday.
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:53.220]   I could have joy, joy that's inexpressible where there's no words, where I'm so freaked
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.500]   out, like happy that I can't...
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.540]   There's no words to explain how good this is."
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.260]   You go, "Oh, I want to try that."
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.660]   It's all these things you read about.
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:13.220]   And maybe you've been reading the menu your whole life, but you've never tasted.
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:20.820]   I'm saying, "God, I can't make that happen.
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.100]   I can't make a blind person see.
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:26.100]   You have to do it.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:31.740]   It has to be a miracle."
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:37.460]   You know, this week they asked me a couple of months ago to come because they want to
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:45.060]   talk about giving to the poor and caring for the needy.
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:50.780]   And so, yeah, that's such a big concern of mine is those who are suffering.
[00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:55.580]   And so I'm like, "Yeah, I'm honored to do that."
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.620]   But I know how Chinese can be.
[00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.900]   You know, we ask you to do something and you do it.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.900]   It's weird.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.420]   It's not like that in America, okay?
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:15.500]   So if we say, "Give to the poor," you're like, "Okay," you know, and you do it.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:23.180]   But I think we're far more concerned about the heart behind it.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.940]   There's a passage I want to show you.
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.500]   It's in 2 Corinthians.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.660]   I love this.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:38.220]   I was looking at it again this morning just going, "Wow, it really says this."
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:47.420]   In 2 Corinthians 8, Paul says this, "We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:54.660]   God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia.
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:20:05.580]   For in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:11.340]   have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.500]   For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means of their
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:24.100]   own accord, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints."
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.100]   Okay.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:33.700]   He says, "I want to tell you," he tells them about the churches in Macedonia, and he says,
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.340]   "They are extremely poor."
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.260]   He says, "I want to tell you about this church.
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:41.420]   They're extremely poor.
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:51.020]   But they earnestly, they kept begging me, 'Can we give our money to the saints who really
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.020]   need it?'"
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.860]   It's like, "What?"
[00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.500]   These guys were very, extremely poor.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.500]   Extremely poor.
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:08.580]   Picture the poorest people you've ever seen, and imagine them begging, "Can we give you
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:14.900]   what we have to other people who are in need?"
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:22.340]   But what I want to point out to you is Paul is not telling the Corinthians about the Macedonian
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.340]   church.
[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.620]   He is not bragging about the Macedonian church.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.540]   He is not saying, "That church, those churches are so amazing in Macedonia."
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:32.660]   No.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.060]   What does he say?
[00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:44.740]   He says, "We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:49.660]   the churches."
[00:21:49.660 --> 00:22:00.300]   He's writing, telling the Corinthians, "I want to tell you, God gave a gift to the Macedonians.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.300]   I want to tell you."
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.460]   Because grace is, right?
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.700]   He gives you something you don't deserve.
[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:11.980]   He goes, "I've got to tell you something that God gave."
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.540]   When someone receives a gift, do we ever boast about that?
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:25.660]   You know, let's suppose, let's pretend Pastor John is rich.
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:30.580]   Okay, use your imagination.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:32.620]   Say financially rich.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.220]   Okay, pretend he's financially rich.
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:47.700]   Say he has billions of dollars and tonight then he hands Pastor Michelle $1 billion.
[00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:52.780]   Here you go, $1 billion.
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:57.340]   Would any of us say, "Wow, Michelle is so awesome"?
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:59.100]   No.
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.180]   We'd go, "You're so lucky.
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:02.660]   Why did you get it?
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:05.180]   How could you be so blessed?
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.780]   How could you be so fortunate?"
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.180]   We'd all look at the giver and go, "You seriously gave her that?"
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.740]   So that's what Paul is saying here in 2 Corinthians 8.
[00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:23.220]   He goes, "I want to tell you what God gave the Macedonian churches, the grace.
[00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:31.420]   He made them so generous that even in their poverty, they're like, 'Can I give?
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:32.420]   Can I give?'"
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:38.900]   See, Paul is explaining this is a gift from God.
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:44.580]   Generosity is, if you're a generous person and I don't know you, I don't know who's stingy.
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:51.420]   I mean, most Chinese are cheap, you know, but there may be some of you that are so generous
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:58.980]   givers and that's nothing to be proud of.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.580]   That's what I love about this passage.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.340]   That was a gift that was given to you.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.380]   Why are you so generous?
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.580]   Because God gave you His grace.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:12.540]   And so that's why it's not like, "Oh, please give.
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.940]   Give to the poor, this or that."
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:20.780]   My prayer is, "God, would you give a gift to Gong Fu Church tonight?"
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.380]   Can you...
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:29.860]   The way you just gave generosity to the Macedonians where they were in extreme poverty and yet
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:36.040]   they became givers, that was a gift.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:43.980]   And there's probably people here that do have a lot of money and you're scared and you're
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.060]   holding on to it.
[00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:48.500]   And you're like, "Well, I don't know if I have enough to retire.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.900]   I don't know if I have enough for my kids to retire.
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.420]   I don't know if my grandkids will have any."
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:58.660]   And you have so much and you're still worried.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:04.660]   And so you know people are dying today, but you're scared.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.860]   And we're not going, "Please, please, just give and beg you."
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:13.100]   We're saying, "God, would you pour out your grace on them?
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.860]   Would you gift them with generosity?"
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:25.440]   Because Jesus says it's more blessed to be a giver than a receiver, right?
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.140]   It's more blessed.
[00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.380]   I mean, try to think.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.260]   Do you know of any generous person?
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:38.260]   Think of the most generous people you know.
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.420]   Do you know of any generous people who are unhappy?
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.060]   My wife and I were talking about that.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:51.260]   Try to think about someone who's just a total giver and just mad all the time.
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:52.260]   It's not.
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.820]   The generous people are the happiest people on earth.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:02.620]   It's those who are holding on and have so much, but they're scared.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:10.220]   There's no joy versus, "Oh, I freely give and God always takes care of me."
[00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:16.540]   I look back at my life and I go, "God, I don't know where I'd be without giving.
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:25.980]   Some of my greatest boasts are the way you came through when we gave."
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:30.940]   I remember the first time I went to Africa.
[00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:37.200]   It was about over 20 years ago.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.100]   I kind of went for selfish reasons.
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.380]   There were some famous people going on the trip.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:54.300]   In fact, there was one of my favorite bands back then was a band named U2.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.060]   Bono was supposed to be on this trip.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:00.420]   I thought, "Whoa, I want to go to Africa with Bono.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.460]   That'd be cool."
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:07.580]   A few others, Franklin Graham, but he's not as cool.
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.060]   A few others, but I'm thinking, "Wow, this would be really cool."
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:14.980]   But then Franklin Graham's mother got sick and so he didn't go.
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:17.340]   And then all the famous people didn't go.
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:24.500]   I'm on a plane going, "Wow, it's just me and a few no-name pastors."
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:37.620]   But when I got there and I saw the poverty of these people, everything in me just wanted
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.780]   to help them.
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.700]   And I just fell in love with these little kids.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.660]   And gosh, they have nothing.
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:52.900]   And I'm seeing these little girls trying to find food in the dump, just lifting things
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.940]   up, looking for anything they can eat.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.540]   And I'm thinking, "I have two little girls at home."
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.260]   I only had two back then.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.540]   And I'm going, "Whoa, what if that was them?
[00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:06.380]   I'm supposed to love them like I would love my own kids."
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.740]   And suddenly, I just had this love.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.140]   And I was like everyone else.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.740]   Yeah, this is a picture of me.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:22.420]   This was during our trip to Ethiopia on our 20-year anniversary.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.700]   So just like seven years ago, we're like, "Gosh, all our greatest times are when we
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.580]   go out and serve."
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:33.700]   And so we go, "Okay, I haven't been to Ethiopia yet and we've been volunteering there, serving
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.700]   there."
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:42.020]   And this girl, I mean, I've never seen anyone like that, that bad.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:45.420]   I've seen a lot of poverty, but not like that.
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.780]   And I remember just, I didn't know if I could touch her.
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:53.580]   I didn't know, you know, when I asked the leader, I go, you know, and her stomach was
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:54.580]   distended.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:57.700]   That means like her organs were already eating themselves.
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:03.140]   And he just said, "She's not going to live no matter what we do."
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:04.940]   I said, "But can I pray for her?"
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.820]   He goes, "Oh, yeah, you can pray for her."
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:08.820]   And I just begged God.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.500]   I said, "Oh, God, can you save her?
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:17.160]   Just keep her alive long enough to worship you."
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.620]   And there were thousands of kids like this.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:25.100]   Just you know, her brothers, sisters, they're all dead.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.100]   It's just weird.
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:32.020]   I've been on trips where I just watched mothers screaming like crazy because their child just
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.580]   died.
[00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.620]   But I think I sent the next picture too.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.700]   You can go to the next slide.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:45.900]   That's her, the same girl a few years ago.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:55.020]   And I can't tell you the thrill of going, you know, that day we were chasing each other
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.020]   around.
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:29:59.980]   We were playing tag and she's just laughing, laughing, laughing.
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:05.020]   Then we have a worship service and I just see her with her hands up in the air worshiping
[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.020]   Jesus.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:09.140]   I go, "God, that's the one thing I prayed for.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:14.620]   Have her live so she could be used to worship you."
[00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:18.140]   There's no way I can explain to you.
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:25.180]   I mean, I'm trying to explain it to you, but I can't have you taste what it's like to chase
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:32.300]   a girl like that around and play tag with her and listen to her laugh and know that
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:38.060]   had we not gone on that trip, she would have died.
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.100]   And she should have died.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.580]   And there's thousands more and sometimes we get there too late.
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.700]   But it's the joy.
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:48.420]   It's the joy.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.420]   It doesn't compare.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:56.020]   You know, when I came home from Africa the first time, I told my wife, I go, "You don't
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.020]   understand.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:00.140]   These kids, they make me so happy."
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.100]   It's not like I feel guilty.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.500]   I go, "I just, I want to give whatever we can."
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:09.940]   And we didn't have very much, but we had a house.
[00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.300]   And I was like, "Do you mind if we sell our house?
[00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.620]   You know, we can just move into a trailer or something like that."
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:22.420]   I said, "Because these kids, I have to do something for them.
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.700]   I want to do something for them."
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:30.380]   And my wife, you know, at that time I think she was maybe pregnant with our third or we
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.060]   had at least two.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:37.860]   And she goes, "Well, it's not, I didn't go with you on the trip.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.740]   So I don't feel what you're feeling.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:47.700]   But if you think God wants us to sell our house, then let's do it."
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:53.180]   And so that day we went out looking for trailer parks and trailers to live in and sold our
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.540]   home and found a smaller place to live in.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:04.300]   And the joy of being able to help these people.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:12.340]   And then I remember, gosh, probably 12, 13 years ago, you know, we kept giving and seeing
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.700]   the results and we kept getting happier.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:22.580]   I remember one time after a service, I'm going, "God, there's so many rich people in our church."
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:30.380]   I go, "But if they really believed in heaven, why wouldn't they be giving it all away?
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.020]   Because you say this is forever.
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:39.380]   And everything I give you, you're going to reward me for a hundredfold forever.
[00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:40.380]   That's a good investment."
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.620]   Okay?
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:46.500]   And so I go, "If they believe that, why won't they give more?
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.020]   Why do they have to live so luxuriously?
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:54.900]   Why can't they just live like a normal person and give the rest of the money if they believe
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:57.140]   in heaven?"
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:03.780]   And in my prayer, I go, "God," at the end, I said, "God, either change him," I said,
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.260]   "or you can make me rich."
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:09.980]   Seriously, this was my prayer.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:15.900]   And I told God, "If you make me rich, I will still live the same way.
[00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.660]   I won't spend any of it.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:25.980]   I'll give it all away because I am so happy knowing you that money won't change me.
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:30.100]   Money can't make me happier."
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:35.460]   And I just kind of said that like I wasn't that serious to say, "Change them or make
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:40.780]   me rich and I'll give it all away and show the world that it doesn't matter."
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:45.340]   And the next year, I made a million dollars.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:52.180]   US, not just a little Hong Kong million, like US million.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.900]   And I'm going, "What?"
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.340]   Because I wrote a book I didn't know I could write.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.780]   My English was terrible.
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:06.940]   My math was awesome, but my Chinese, you know, but the English was horrible.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.620]   And then I write a book and it becomes a bestseller.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:12.540]   And I'm going, "What?"
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:15.180]   And they go, "Yeah, you'll have...
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:19.180]   Looks like you'll have millions of dollars coming in."
[00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:25.260]   And I told my wife, I'm like, "We're not touching any of it."
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.660]   I told God, "If you made me rich, I don't want it.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.500]   I'll give it all away."
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:37.020]   And immediately, we signed over all the royalties, you know, to a nonprofit and just saying,
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:44.140]   you know, we spend the last, I don't know, 10 years or so just giving away millions of
[00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.700]   dollars around the world.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:51.820]   And that's why I feel like we're the happiest people in the world.
[00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:56.460]   And we still drove the same old car, same old clothes.
[00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.780]   I mean, this is the only...
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:03.460]   This is the only time I've ever preached in a suit, you know, like, because I heard that's
[00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:06.820]   what you do.
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:07.820]   And I just bought this.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.620]   I had the same suit for 20 years.
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.620]   And then my second, third daughter just got married.
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.220]   So we bought this for $100.
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:24.500]   But before the suit, I just wore the same old clothes because it's like, it doesn't
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.780]   matter.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:34.020]   For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.020]   This is why...
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.100]   How much time do I have?
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.100]   I'm okay?
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.500]   Okay, I'll tell one more story.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.260]   Okay, all right.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:53.380]   Like when I read in the book of Luke, in the book of Luke, Jesus is talking to rich people.
[00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:59.020]   In Luke 18, you remember the story of the rich young ruler?
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:07.260]   And the rich young ruler comes to Jesus and he says, "What do I have to do to go to heaven?"
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.860]   And Jesus answered him in a way that we wouldn't.
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:14.860]   He says, "Well, have you obeyed the commands?"
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.500]   And the guy's like, "Yeah, yeah, I obeyed them."
[00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.100]   And then Jesus says something crazy.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.060]   I mean, this man is just asking, "How do I go to heaven?"
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:33.100]   And Jesus, "Sell everything you have and give it to the poor."
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:41.180]   And the man, it says, he walked away sad because he had so much.
[00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:50.100]   See that's the way some people respond when we ask them to give to those who are in need.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:57.100]   They almost get sad, like, "Ugh, give to the poor."
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.420]   And for this man, it was everything.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:07.220]   And the Son of God asked him to do it and he was sad because he felt like someone's
[00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:14.380]   taking away something I love.
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:20.740]   But then in the very next chapter, after Jesus says, "Oh, it's so hard for the rich to enter
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.580]   the kingdom of heaven.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:27.300]   It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:30.060]   the gates of heaven."
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:36.100]   But then in the next chapter, in the next chapter, there's a man named Zacchaeus.
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:45.580]   And the Bible specifically says in Luke 19, in verse 2, "There was a man named Zacchaeus.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:51.900]   He was a chief tax collector and was rich."
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:56.740]   And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd, he couldn't because
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.740]   he was small.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:02.980]   So he ran on ahead, climbed up a sycamore tree.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:08.540]   And then, you know, Jesus sees him and says, "Get down, I want to come to your house."
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:10.860]   And you know the story, Zacchaeus is like, "What?
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:11.860]   Jesus?
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.220]   Jesus is going to come to my house?"
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.460]   He gets so excited.
[00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:24.280]   So he came down and received him joyfully.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:32.120]   And then in verse 8, "Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, 'Behold, Lord, half of my
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.120]   goods I give to the poor.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:41.980]   And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.'
[00:38:41.980 --> 00:38:47.100]   And Jesus said to him, 'Today salvation has come to this house.'"
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:52.100]   Remember, Jesus says it's hard for the rich.
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:58.660]   But then here it says he's a rich man and he goes, "Salvation has come to this house."
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:02.700]   What's crazy is you don't even have a record of Jesus saying, "Well, give to the poor."
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:06.900]   Zacchaeus just goes, "I can't believe you're in my house.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.220]   You're in my house.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.220]   The Son of God is in my house.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:14.020]   Okay, everyone, half of everything I own goes to the poor.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.020]   And I know I've stolen money from some of you.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.580]   I'll give you four times as much back with the rest of my money."
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:25.620]   And Jesus just sees Zacchaeus and goes, "Salvation has come to this house."
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:30.180]   Do you see the difference in the attitude?
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:34.340]   One person is looking at his money going, "Oh, I don't know.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.700]   I don't know.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.060]   I don't know."
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.420]   You're asking for everything.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.460]   I don't know.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:46.340]   The other person, Zacchaeus is like, "Jesus, you're Jesus.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.620]   You're the Son of God.
[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:49.460]   You want to come into my house?
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:50.460]   Seriously?
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.860]   Oh my gosh, this is crazy.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.700]   Here, take all my money.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:54.980]   You guys, I know I stole from you.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:55.980]   Here's the money."
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:59.420]   He's not thinking about his money.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:04.220]   He's looking at Jesus and going, "I can't believe you're willing to come into my house."
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:15.620]   You see, when you really understand who Jesus is, when you've really tasted and you really
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:21.820]   go, "Wait, so Jesus, you went earth.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.340]   And then the earth just showed up?"
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.420]   He's like, "Yeah, yeah, that's what I did."
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:31.460]   "Oh my gosh, and you're in my house.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.060]   Like you seriously, what did you do?
[00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.060]   You just said light?"
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.100]   He goes, "Yeah, I just said light."
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.820]   And just, "That's it?"
[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:42.580]   And then light, like the sun, "Well, how did it?"
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:46.180]   And now you're in my house.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.700]   Of course I'm not thinking about my money.
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.140]   Of course I'm not thinking about retirement.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:59.020]   You spoke the world into existence and now you're about to go to the cross and you're
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.620]   going to die for me?
[00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:07.540]   To pay for everything I've done wrong?
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:09.620]   Because you want me?
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.340]   Because Jesus, you want me?
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:16.580]   You want relationship?
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.780]   You want to know me?
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:24.620]   My own dad didn't want to know me.
[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:28.860]   And you who spoke the world into existence, you're going to die on a cross because you
[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:32.560]   want me?
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.060]   This is crazy.
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:40.420]   This is insane.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:46.020]   That's why a few million dollars, you're talking about money?
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.620]   You think I care about money?
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:56.100]   Man, I go, "God, thank you.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.100]   Thank you.
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:02.520]   You gave me a gift.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:06.220]   You opened my eyes."
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:10.180]   And now money, nothing matters.
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.740]   You have it all.
[00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:18.940]   Because for me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:32.980]   And I'm praying that some of you would be honest enough to admit, "Wow, I feel more
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.860]   like the rich young ruler than I do Zacchaeus.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:38.380]   I'm looking at all these things.
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:43.340]   I didn't have to give up to really follow Jesus and I still love them all.
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:48.500]   And I don't know if I'm ready to follow him.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:54.260]   But I see Zacchaeus and now you're explaining who Jesus is?"
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:43:01.420]   And I'm going, "Wow, he really did that for me?"
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:08.340]   And maybe tonight he's going to open your eyes because I prayed that.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:14.580]   For some of you, maybe you're like a lot of the people in the church I grew up with where
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:19.500]   you did things, you obeyed things.
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:26.740]   You didn't do anything super evil, you know, all the thou shall not command, you got them
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:27.740]   down.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.040]   You stayed away from those things.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:37.380]   But this joy of tasting God and going, "Oh, I love him.
[00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:41.000]   I just want to leave this earth and be with him.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.240]   Jesus, please come because I miss you.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.200]   I just want to be with you.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:53.880]   I just want to hold you and experience you even more."
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.480]   That's what I'm praying for.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:07.800]   In fact, even right now, I'm going to pray that God would give some of you the gift.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.600]   I'm not asking you to give, okay?
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.160]   I'm going to ask God to give.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:20.680]   I want him to give you sight like Zacchaeus.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:26.920]   I want him to give you generosity like the Macedonians.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:41.400]   Father, right now, I praise you.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:58.280]   I worship you for opening up my eyes to how beautiful you are, for giving me generosity.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:11.480]   God, I was just as selfish as anyone until you opened my eyes to what a treasure I have
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.040]   in Jesus.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:21.280]   Money is ridiculous to me now, Lord.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.680]   That's a gift from you.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:38.200]   And I pray for my new friends in this room that you would pour your grace out on them,
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:49.880]   that they would see you even now as we worship you, that they would taste of you.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:46:15.560]   Holy Spirit, please fall on this room.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:29.320]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
