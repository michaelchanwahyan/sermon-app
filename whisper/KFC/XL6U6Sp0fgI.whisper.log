[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Hi, everybody.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.720]   Hope you're all doing well.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.200]   We're starting, we've been starting this new series last week.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.040]   It's on 1 Peter chapter 2.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.060]   And it's going to be a little bit of an interactive sermon today.
[00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.240]   So get ready to type.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.200]   The first thing I want you to type in the chat is what comes up?
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.680]   What's the first thing that comes up on your mind when it says God's grace and submission?
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.260]   What's the first thing that comes to mind when it says God's grace and submission?
[00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.200]   You can type anything you want.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   Jesus.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.720]   Yeah, very good.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.720]   Very good.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.720]   The cross.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.720]   Absolutely.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.000]   Grace and submission.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Obedience.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Very good.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   From Anshan.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.200]   Anything else?
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.760]   What comes to mind?
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.400]   Letting go of ourselves.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.440]   That's a very good one, right?
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.120]   Letting go to receive God's grace and also giving ourselves to God.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.120]   Absolutely.
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.120]   Salvation.
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.120]   Very good.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.160]   Any other, any other, any other things that come to mind when we think of God's grace
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.160]   and submission?
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.160]   Okay.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.440]   Those are very good.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.800]   So last week, Pastor James did an excellent talk on teaching us what it means to have
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.280]   living hope.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.060]   And last week we saw, right, we have inheritance because we are now part of God's family.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.000]   And because of this inheritance, we also have reward.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.400]   In verse six to seven, Pastor James talked about the suffering that we also have.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.800]   And when we have this suffering, God refines us so that we become more like him and we
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.360]   receive salvation through Jesus.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.280]   And he is the one that rescues us.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.880]   And so today we are talking about the next part, which is grace and submission, grace
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.360]   and submission.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.260]   So there's four things that we're going to talk about today in terms of grace and submission.
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.240]   The first is that we are part of the same family.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.240]   That's right.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.280]   Look at the people beside you.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.880]   We're part of the same family.
[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.200]   Like it or not, we're part of the same family.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.800]   The second thing we're going to learn about is we are stones in the same house.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.080]   We are priests in the same temple, number three.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.200]   And number four, we are citizens of the same nation.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.160]   So we're going to read the passage for today.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.840]   So verse 22 here, "Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.600]   brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.760]   Because you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable through the living
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.960]   and abiding word of God.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:59.240]   So put away all malice and deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slender like newborn infants,
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.560]   long for the pure spiritual milk that by it you may grow up into salvation.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.400]   If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good."
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:20.360]   And so we see here in the second part of chapter one that Peter is confirming that we have
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.640]   been born again, right?
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.840]   We have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.580]   What Jesus has done on the cross for us is that now we no longer live for the earthly
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:44.000]   and the temporary, but now we live for the eternal and for the heavenly things.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.440]   And so we have been born again, as we see in the next slide, that we are part of the
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   same family.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.600]   We've been born again to the same family.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.840]   And Jesus also does that to us, for us through the living and abiding word of God.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.920]   His word is truth.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.320]   What he says, he will accomplish.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.240]   And his promise was that if we believe in our heart that Jesus Christ is Lord, we are
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.280]   now part of his family.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.180]   We are a child of God.
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.240]   And so this is what God has done for us.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.960]   He's died on the cross for us so that we are born again.
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:30.140]   We are now born for the eternal, for the heavenly, and we are born through the word of God.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:37.540]   It says here, through the living and abiding word of God, that Jesus is the word, the way,
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.540]   the life, and the truth.
[00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.500]   And no one comes to the Father except through him.
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.840]   And so that's what God has done.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.980]   And so this is God's part.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.580]   That part is grace.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.220]   What we need to do is we need to submit.
[00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.780]   And Peter tells us here that we need to purify ourselves, right?
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.620]   Because we've been born again, we need to pure ourselves.
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.740]   No more slander, no more malice.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.500]   Do good things to each other.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.020]   We need to love each other earnestly.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.460]   We need to put away sin.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.100]   And a great example of this is the prodigal son, right?
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.020]   When he recognized, I've done wrong things.
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.540]   I can go back to my father if I turn from my ways of wild living, of throwing away all
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.060]   my inheritance.
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.420]   He had to put away his sins first.
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.700]   As we see in the next slide, the prodigal son returns to the father.
[00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.460]   He's willing to obey.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.620]   And what does the father do?
[00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.380]   The father runs to him with open arms.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:53.540]   He sees his son in the distant and he runs to him and he receives the father and receives
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.660]   his son, the prodigal son.
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.500]   And so that is what we need to do as we are part of the same family.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.300]   Yes, we've received God's grace already, but we also need to do our part to obey, to love
[00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.940]   one another, to put away sin.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:20.100]   And the last part that Peter also said is that we need to long for pure spiritual milk
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.660]   so that we will be able to grow.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:28.060]   Now a lot of us in this KFC family has had newborn babies.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.060]   Praise the Lord, right?
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.580]   We have Josh and Mel.
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.260]   We have Sam and Rachel.
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.740]   We have Rocky and Adrian.
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:43.220]   We have lots of people that we've been blessed as this KFCI family with newborn babies.
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.460]   We've had people with new newborn dogs, right?
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:54.060]   And puppies, Vincent and Agnes, you know, dogs are a special part of our family as well.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:00.620]   What's amazing about these babies, these puppies, is that they don't have to think twice about
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.100]   spiritual, about milk, right?
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.300]   They long for milk.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.940]   They know they need it, right?
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.940]   The babies aren't like, "Oh yeah, I don't know.
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.660]   I don't know if I want milk today.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.340]   You know, I might not feel like milk today."
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.300]   No, they long for milk.
[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.320]   You know, Agnes' puppy, it longs for food, right?
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.380]   It doesn't have to think twice about it.
[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:27.900]   And so if we are doing the right things, we will naturally long for spiritual milk.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.940]   We will long to grow in the Word of God through prayer, through fellowship, through our church
[00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.300]   community.
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.480]   And so that is what we need to do as we submit to the Lord.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.180]   And so the first thing that we see in grace and submission is that we are part of the
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.340]   same family.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.180]   The second part of it is that we are stones in the same house.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.700]   I want you to type in the chat, what is the biggest thing that you've built?
[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.620]   It could be a model car.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.660]   It could be a snowman.
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.500]   It could be a sandcastle.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.780]   What's the biggest thing that you've built?
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:12.200]   It could be a, I know Joseph has built a lot of things, right?
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.540]   What's the biggest thing that you've built?
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.180]   Come on, don't take too long.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.720]   What's the biggest thing you've built?
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.000]   It could be something small.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.620]   It could be something big.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.780]   What's the biggest thing that you've built?
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.780]   A wall.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.780]   Okay.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.780]   All right.
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.500]   Hopefully, hopefully we're building bridges, not walls.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.340]   Ikea furniture.
[00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.340]   That's right.
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.340]   A family.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.340]   Oh, very good.
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.620]   We're getting very, very spiritual here.
[00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.900]   A Lego boat.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.900]   That's super cool.
[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.300]   I wonder what boat it was.
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.300]   All right.
[00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.300]   What else?
[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.300]   What else do we have?
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.300]   A new family.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:50.300]   Awesome.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.300]   That's great.
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.860]   A fort in the woods.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.860]   Oh my.
[00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.840]   I wonder what kind of material you built that fort with.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.500]   Anybody built a snowman or a snow fort or an igloo?
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.420]   That's something we like to do in Canada when we have snow.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.420]   All right.
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:15.220]   We're going to read the next passage about how God is building us in the same house.
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:21.420]   Verse four, "As you come to him, a living stone rejected by man, but in the sight of
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:28.940]   God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:36.140]   house to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.340]   Christ.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:45.580]   For it stands in scripture, 'Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:51.660]   and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.'"
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.540]   And so we see here that God has built.
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:05.460]   God has built stones that were once rejected, but now chosen and precious.
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:12.940]   Jesus was rejected, but he was chosen by the Father, chosen by the Father, and he himself
[00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:13.940]   is precious.
[00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.740]   And we are also like those living stones.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:23.980]   Peter says that we might also be rejected by people or the world, but we were chosen
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.300]   and we are also precious according to the Father.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:34.060]   And he builds us up into a spiritual house, into a spiritual house.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.240]   It's amazing that the Jews, they have the temple, right?
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.900]   If you've been to Jerusalem, if you've been to Israel with Pastor John, you would have
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.300]   been to this amazing temple, right?
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.940]   They think that this wall is part of the temple.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.040]   The Jews have a temple.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.500]   And Jesus says, "We also have a temple."
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.340]   And the temple is that we are the body of Christ.
[00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:04.820]   Our bodies is the temple of God.
[00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:10.980]   If you've been to Dubai or if you've been to a really tall building and you look up,
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:18.660]   right, as we see, you know, the purge caliph, right, in the next slide, we look up and we're
[00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:23.940]   just amazed how amazing this building is.
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:33.720]   Imagine that each glass, each metal part, each brick, each component of the purge caliph
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.940]   is like us.
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:43.380]   We are being built up into a spiritual house, a living spiritual house.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.500]   Has anybody played Jenga before?
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.940]   Everybody loves playing Jenga, right?
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:50.820]   It's an amazing game, right?
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.740]   You're taking brick from brick, what you call it, those wooden logs or wooden bricks, right?
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:01.200]   And you're taking it up from the bottom and you're trying to put it onto the top.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:07.740]   And this Jenga spiritual house is getting bigger and bigger as new people come to know
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.820]   Jesus.
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.980]   And we have to be very careful because it might tumble, right?
[00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:19.420]   That's not going to happen in our spiritual house because Jesus is building us up.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:25.540]   Don't worry, this spiritual house will not collapse because Jesus is the foundation.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.620]   His word is the foundation.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:35.180]   And so the second thing that we see is God's grace is that we are part of this spiritual
[00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.900]   house that is being built up.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.140]   And we also partake upon it.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:49.100]   We need to submit to the body of Christ as we are part of his spiritual house.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:55.620]   And so the next thing we see is that we are priests in the same temple.
[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.200]   So firstly, we are of the same family.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.220]   The second thing is we are stones of the same house.
[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.840]   And thirdly, we are priests in the same temple.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.100]   And so let's read the next passage together.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:13.160]   And you yourselves, like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house to be
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:20.180]   a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:26.940]   But you are a chosen race, in verse 9, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:34.180]   own possession that you may proclaim his excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into
[00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.480]   his marvelous light.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.240]   So what is a priest?
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.880]   You guys can type into the chat, what is a priest?
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.720]   What is a royal priesthood?
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.700]   Any ideas?
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:53.600]   What is the role or the occupation or the job of a priest?
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.640]   What is a priest?
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.640]   Any ideas?
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.520]   Type in the chat for me.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.000]   What is the role or a job of a priest?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.240]   Okay, Julian, very good.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:11.360]   He mediates between us and God, one who is set apart, very good, serving God.
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.080]   Yeah, these are excellent.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:22.000]   That is exactly what a priest should do, perform sacrifices as offerings to preach.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.200]   Absolutely.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.240]   These are all what a priest should do.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:34.480]   And so God's grace is that we have been called to be a holy and royal priesthood.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.280]   Before it was just the line of the Levites, right?
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:44.320]   They, a specific tribe within Israel, they were called to be priests, to be mediators
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.800]   between them and the rest of the other tribes.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.580]   Before, they were called to make sacrifices on behalf of the people.
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:15:00.520]   But now we are called to be a holy and royal priesthood.
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:06.360]   And what Jesus calls us to do, and what Peter specifically calls us to do now is that we
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   must offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.360]   Let's add to that.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:21.880]   What do you think are spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ that
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.760]   now we as Christians offer?
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:33.320]   Obviously, you know, we're not bringing our goats and our lambs to our online Zoom services
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:40.680]   and offering them as blood sacrifices and sin offerings to the Lord because now we have
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.400]   Jesus Christ.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:49.280]   And so what are spiritual sacrifices that we need to offer?
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.280]   That's very good.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.760]   Confession, absolutely.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.320]   Confession, obedience.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.320]   Very good.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.560]   Wow, you guys should be preaching this.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:57.560]   You know, not me.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   You guys are excellent.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.720]   Yeah, come on.
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.720]   Keep adding to that.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.080]   What else?
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:07.460]   What else are spiritual sacrifices that we can offer to the Lord that can be acceptable
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:08.460]   to Him?
[00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.440]   What do you guys think?
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.880]   Any others?
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.320]   Our own way of doing things.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.320]   That's interesting.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.200]   What do you mean by that, Michelle?
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.880]   What do you mean by that?
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.880]   Any others?
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.880]   Obedience.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.880]   Okay.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.240]   How we live our lives.
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.440]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.000]   Jesus says, or Paul says in Romans 8 that we are living sacrifices.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Right?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Worship.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Absolutely.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Very good.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.520]   Oh, Anthony, you've been learning a lot in your seminary classes.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.960]   Let's look at the next slide and it'll give us some ways that we can offer sacrifices
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.960]   to the Lord.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.960]   Prayer.
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   As we pray.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.960]   Right?
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.400]   Prayer is a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.280]   Prayer is our way of saying that we submit to you, Lord.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.840]   That we ask your will to be done.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.520]   As we praise the Lord, just like Paul and the team led us in praise.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.040]   That is offering spiritual sacrifices to the Lord.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.440]   Michelle, you know, she said, obedience.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:14.240]   And that we need to offer ourselves as living sacrifices.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:19.920]   We can offer ourselves through time as we serve the Lord.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.920]   Right?
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.480]   As we spend time helping those around us.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.480]   Loving our neighbors.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.160]   Honoring our parents.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160]   We can tithe.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160]   Right?
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.580]   We can offer our offerings of tithe.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.960]   Pastor John said we can offer, you know, through FPS.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.960]   Right?
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:40.800]   That is one of the ways that we can offer spiritual sacrifices to the Lord.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.420]   Our talents, obviously.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.780]   Each of you have been blessed with many talents.
[00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:47.460]   It could be musical.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.860]   It could be, you know, service.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.860]   Right?
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:51.980]   It could be encouragement.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.020]   It could be our heart.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.020]   Absolutely.
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.580]   We can offer our hearts to the Lord as well.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.900]   And we can also offer our testimony as spiritual sacrifice to the Lord.
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.180]   Pleasing to him.
[00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:10.660]   As we share with others what God has done in and through our lives.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.620]   Just like Ken shared today.
[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.440]   What God has done in and through his life.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.060]   He was once lonely.
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:24.540]   And now he has found a relationship with God and a community with his church.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.100]   Our church.
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:33.740]   And so, number three was that we are a spiritual priest.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.420]   Holy and royal of the same temple.
[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:42.140]   And finally, we are citizens of the same nation.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.920]   Citizens of the same nation.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.700]   It's amazing, right?
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.620]   That we can be part of the same nation.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.500]   We have, we might all have different passports.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.500]   Right?
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.380]   We might have British passports.
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.140]   We might have Hong Kong passports.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.900]   I have a Canadian passport.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.900]   Right?
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.380]   Some of you have other passports.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.500]   Might be Australian.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:11.100]   But we are all part of God's family.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.500]   God's nation.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.140]   We have a spiritual passport.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.380]   And we're going to look at the last passage for us today.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.180]   That you are a chosen people.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.340]   A royal priesthood.
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.900]   A holy nation.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.500]   God's special possession.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:32.180]   That you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.460]   light.
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:38.000]   Once you were not a people, but now you are a people of God.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.380]   Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:48.540]   And so we see here God's grace in the next slide.
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.540]   God's grace is that he has chosen us.
[00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.540]   He has chosen you.
[00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.660]   Me.
[00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:57.620]   All the people that you see on Zoom.
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.300]   And the people that you don't see on Zoom.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:03.660]   Who only turn on, you know, who don't turn on their videos.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:08.940]   Those people are also part of God's chosen nation.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.380]   You're a royal priesthood.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.740]   We are a holy nation.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.860]   God has set us apart for his royal and holy purposes.
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:23.700]   Peter says that we are God's special possession.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:29.900]   Once we were not a part of God's people, we were strangers.
[00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.620]   We were foreigners.
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.780]   But now God has accepted us.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:40.820]   How amazing is that feeling when somebody new accepts us into his family.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.340]   When we have a meal together.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:51.060]   I remember when I first flew to New Zealand, I met some people on the plane to New Zealand.
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.220]   New Zealanders, Kiwis are the friendliest people.
[00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.020]   These people invited me over to their house to have a meal.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.980]   We've just met on the plane.
[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.460]   And they're like, come over.
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.700]   And you feel like you're a part of a family.
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.380]   You're a part of God's people.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:15.860]   Jesus says we were once not a part of his people, but we've been received as his people.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:18.860]   We have mercy now.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.140]   And so that is God's grace.
[00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:27.420]   And what must we do now that we are part of his family?
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:34.980]   It says here we need to declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:38.220]   his wonderful light.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:42.460]   That is what we need to do as God's chosen people.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.740]   Royal priesthood, a holy nation.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:51.900]   And so we've been sharing tips towards sharing the good news.
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:58.300]   And we said that we need to have spiritual eyes to see the people around us who don't
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.380]   have Jesus.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.140]   We need to connect with them, right?
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:09.100]   Through tennis, through music, maybe through financial talk, right?
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.700]   Maybe through walking our dogs together.
[00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.860]   We can connect with people that way.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:19.380]   And as we connect with people through different things, we build trust.
[00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:26.580]   And people come to know Jesus because firstly, a lot of them know a Christian.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:33.540]   And a Christian invites them to know Jesus through church, through different events.
[00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:39.880]   You know, what's amazing about Ken as we see Ken on the next slide is that he didn't believe
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:45.980]   in Jesus yet when he came to our summer college program.
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.060]   And he invited his friend, which was Justin.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.900]   And Justin, he saw that, oh, Justin had been dealing with certain issues.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:57.160]   He was dealing with certain relationship issues.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.980]   And he wanted to invite him to church.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.440]   And Ken was not a Christian yet.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.940]   And Ken was like, come to church.
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.260]   You know, I think God can help you.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:06.900]   It's because he came to our community.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:13.560]   I mean, he saw what God's community can do, what God's people can do, what God's holy
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.360]   priesthood could do.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:24.900]   Ken as a non-Christian invited Justin, a non-Christian, to come to SEP because he felt the community,
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.120]   the love of God.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.200]   And that's what we've been called to do.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:40.500]   We've been called to help people come out of darkness to see his light, to see his light.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:46.220]   And so not only has Ken come to know Jesus, eventually me and Justin, he had a lot of
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.220]   questions.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.640]   He was very curious about God.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:57.040]   And after he went back to the UK, he also came into a loving relationship with Jesus.
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:03.340]   He came out of the spiritual darkness into the spiritual light.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:12.560]   And so let me summarize what grace we have received from Jesus, that we have received
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.160]   a new identity.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:24.580]   It's no longer lies and tangs and snell groves and chungs and engs and wongs.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.580]   We are Christians.
[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:34.060]   It's no longer lows and roths and fungs.
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:35.060]   We are Christians.
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.760]   We are part of the same family.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.160]   We have a new identity.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.420]   And that is found in Jesus Christ.
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:52.120]   Do you still see yourself as separated from God's family?
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.720]   Or do you have a new identity?
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:58.740]   And that is in Jesus Christ.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:05.540]   What we need to do is come into obedience, submit to him, and be a part of this spiritual
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.880]   family.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:14.020]   God's grace is that we have a new direction.
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.140]   We have a new spiritual direction.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.640]   Jesus is our cornerstone.
[00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.280]   Cornerstone is the first stone you lay.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:28.100]   And then after that, every stone goes according to that first cornerstone.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.380]   Jesus is our new direction.
[00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.640]   Jesus has built up the body of Christ.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.600]   We are the body of Christ.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.180]   We have a new direction.
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.460]   We are not living for the earthly and the temporary.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.800]   We are living for the eternal and the heavenly.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.620]   We have a new direction.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.060]   We have a new service.
[00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:57.940]   We are called to be priests, to mediate between us and God.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:02.160]   Those who do not know God to God.
[00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.380]   We have a new service.
[00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.620]   We need to pray for those who do not know Jesus.
[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.580]   We need to confess our own sins.
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:16.540]   We need to offer up our talents and our services to the Lord as holy and pleasing sacrifices
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.640]   to him.
[00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.300]   We have a new service.
[00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.340]   Are you willing to serve the Lord?
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:28.140]   No longer serve yourself, but serve the Lord.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.940]   And lastly, we are a new people.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.620]   We have a new covenant.
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.100]   Before it was God's chosen people.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:42.780]   The Israelites, they had this calling to be a holy people.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.180]   Chosen to serve God.
[00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.700]   And now this covenant is no longer just with the Israelites.
[00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:51.220]   It is with us.
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:55.980]   You, me, all of you on Zoom here.
[00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:59.780]   We are all part of God's holy nation.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:03.140]   We have a new covenant.
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:14.060]   And this covenant is a calling to not just receive blessings from God, but to be a blessing.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:21.220]   And so are you willing to be a blessing to those around you?
[00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.800]   Maybe it's your family.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.220]   Be a blessing to them.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:27.300]   Build them up.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.340]   Help them to come one step closer towards Jesus.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.860]   Maybe it's people at your workplace.
[00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.700]   It's often tricky, right?
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.500]   How do we share Jesus with those in the workplace?
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:46.980]   Connect with them, build trust, and set an example for them of the love and grace you've
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.980]   experienced from God.
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.220]   And so, do we have a new identity?
[00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.740]   Do we have a new direction?
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.540]   Do we have a new service?
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.220]   Do we have a new covenant with Christ?
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.300]   We're going to sing a song.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.300]   It's called Cornerstone.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.940]   Jesus is our cornerstone.
[00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:18.740]   He is the one that upholds our faith and builds us up.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:19.740]   Let's pray.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:26.240]   Heavenly Father, bless us so that we can be a blessing to others.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.580]   Thank you for your grace, Father.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:34.260]   We ask that you would help us to submit to you so that we can build others up.
[00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:38.780]   Call those who are in darkness into your wonderful light.
