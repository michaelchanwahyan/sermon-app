[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.720]   Last week I shared from the book of Ecclesiastes chapter 7, this preacher, this Kohelet, gatherer
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:21.360]   of wisdom, maybe Solomon himself, he starts dropping some wisdom, applications on how
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.760]   to live in this complicated world.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.560]   He says there's so many things that he's seen.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.120]   There is nothing new under the sun, everything is meaningless, but ultimately this is what
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120]   you should do.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.960]   Have a right perspective on life and death.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.080]   Have a right perspective on prosperity and adversity.
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.360]   And one of the bits in this chapter 7 is him talking about, hey, look, I've seen that righteous
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.960]   people and wicked people, their lives in terms of what they end up having to experience is
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.920]   really not all that different.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.480]   The wicked people, the unrighteous ones, they seem to get goodies too.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.400]   The sun seems to shine on them and the righteous people who are trying everything to be as
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.280]   best as they can, they still have rain fall on them.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.220]   And so he's talking about this and in chapter 8 he moves into really attacking or addressing
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.640]   this issue even more.
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.080]   And the title of this evening's topic is, What About the Wicked?
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.180]   As we look around at the world right now, as we see the news, there is no shortage of
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.180]   bad news.
[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.640]   There is no shortage of hearing about bad people.
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.920]   Even this last week we heard, of course, from the country where I came from, Her Majesty
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.400]   the Queen passes away and there's so much that's flooding in terms of all the good things
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.920]   about her, everything that she stood for, everything that she stood for that was to
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.360]   be admired, but yet there's always this other side that there are people who talk about
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.600]   different things when it comes to the British Empire and everything that's happened in history
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.360]   and you can't ignore that.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.540]   And there's all these different pieces of news as we look on the channels and we see
[00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.920]   just bad things after bad things and we see people killing each other, people hurting
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.320]   each other, people being selfish, people being greedy.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.160]   And then you might ask yourself, God, what about those people?
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.200]   What about those people who are simply out to hurt others?
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.440]   Why don't you stop them?
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.960]   That's what Kohala, that's what the preacher here is saying.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.040]   He's looking around at everything and he's going, why are these people still around?
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:27.520]   Chapter 8, verse 8 to 9 has this, "No man has power to retain the spirit or power over
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520]   the day of death.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.440]   There is no discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.800]   All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun when man
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.600]   had power over man to his hurt."
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.840]   Now it's not easy to read, it's not easy to understand, but what he's saying here is,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.980]   I've seen so much.
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.720]   We don't have any control over the wind, we don't have any control over death, and actually
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.160]   people seem so intent on hurting each other.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.200]   And it is just the way it is, is what he's saying.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.000]   And then he goes on further, and we're only going to focus on a few verses here from 10
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.600]   to 15, and he carries on.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   Then he says this, "Then I saw the wicked buried."
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   Those bad people.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.820]   Those bad people.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.780]   "I started seeing them die.
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.460]   They used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.620]   done such things.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.680]   This also is vanity, because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily,
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.060]   the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil."
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.860]   He's saying, I've seen wicked people, I've seen them die, and I've seen them get away
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.860]   with it.
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.620]   And when they get away with it, they keep going.
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.620]   That's what he's saying.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.500]   "Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yeah, I know that it
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.240]   will be well with those who fear God, because they fear before him.
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.860]   But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.660]   he does not fear before God."
[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.100]   He's saying he's seen evil, he's seen sinners do evil things, and yet it prolongs their
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.100]   life.
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.100]   They've been able to live long lives.
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.260]   "But ultimately I know, ultimately I know that it will not be well for them, or at the
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.340]   very least it will be well for those who fear God.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.100]   And finally, there is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.220]   to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people
[00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.500]   to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.260]   I said that this is also vanity.
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.060]   And I commend joy, for man has nothing better under the sun, but to eat and drink and be
[00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.780]   joyful, for this will go with him in his tour through the days of his life that God has
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.220]   given him under the sun."
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.700]   This is the word of the Lord, albeit hard to understand.
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.540]   I shared with you last week that I found Ecclesiastes so complex, so confusing often.
[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.900]   You've got this preacher who's filled with wisdom, he's gathered all this wisdom, and
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.900]   yet he seems just as confused as us.
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.580]   And of course, some people really do love this book.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.940]   Actually, as I was looking at it, as I was preparing the sermons, I was like, "Man, Ecclesiastes
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.460]   is so tricky, so challenging, so hard to understand."
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.620]   And then I turn over and talk to my wife, and she's like, "It's my favourite book."
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.980]   And then I realise, "Oh, so that's why I've struggled to understand you, because this
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.540]   is what it looks like."
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.580]   And you see there's no difference.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.500]   And yet, I think the preacher is trying to say something to us.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.420]   Kohele is trying to explain something to us, which is this.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.580]   Your knowledge and your understanding of this world is limited.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.820]   As much as you want to be wise, you're still not going to truly get it.
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.020]   And this passage here, he's venting, actually.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.660]   He's talking about the wicked.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.660]   One, they exist, not good.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.720]   Two, they don't get punished, bad.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.380]   When they don't get punished, they keep going.
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.540]   Not good at all, not fair.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.540]   And so what do we do?
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.500]   This is essentially what he's saying.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.420]   Someone kind of brings this a little bit down to earth and writes this quote about this
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.660]   passage that may relate to us.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.740]   He says, "Cruel dictators drive out free governments.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.260]   The man who robs investors of their inheritance gets a huge bonus, while hardworking people
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.100]   lose their jobs and their homes.
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.260]   Suffering pastors are put in prison, while the persecutors of the church grow strong
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.700]   in their cruel power.
[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.660]   To bring things down to the personal level, the student who gets cheated on a difficult
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.820]   exam gets an A, but all you get is a C-.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.220]   The worker who stabbed you in the back gets the promotion, while you remain stuck at the
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.220]   same pay grade.
[00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.160]   Or you make a commitment to chastity, and although you are still single, the girl who
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.460]   throws herself at men gets a ring on her finger and a long white dress.
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.100]   Something doesn't seem right.
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.820]   Something is off.
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.220]   It just isn't fair.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.960]   God, where are you?
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.060]   What are you doing?"
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.540]   Have we asked those questions before?
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.220]   Have we looked at the news and seen people who are in charge of big, big countries, who
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:46.180]   are maybe not looking after their own people well, or maybe attacking other people, hurting
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.700]   other people, and we think, "God, why don't you come and just zap them?
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.740]   Zap them, just lightning.
[00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.580]   Just remove them from the earth so they can stop hurting people."
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.900]   Have you ever thought that?
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.760]   I think Kohelet has been thinking that.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.440]   He's going, "What do we do?
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.960]   The wickedness surrounding us, what do we do?"
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.440]   As I was thinking that, and I was joining him in the venting, and I was like, "Yeah!
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.800]   These people should be killed.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.800]   They shouldn't have a chance.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.800]   They shouldn't have a second chance.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   They should be wiped out.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.720]   Wouldn't the world be so much better with him, him, him, her, her, or be disappeared,
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.720]   removed from the earth?
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.000]   Wouldn't that be better?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.680]   God, where are you?
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.680]   What are you doing?"
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.400]   As I was reflecting on that, I think I was really challenged by a few things.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:32.640]   There were some things about my perspective that was wrong when it comes to the wicked.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.160]   When I asked that question, "God, what about those guys?
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.800]   God, what about them?
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.320]   Why aren't you dealing with them?"
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.800]   It really challenged me on a couple of things.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.160]   There are three questions that came up in my mind that I'd love to share with you today.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.160]   The first question is this, "Who do we actually see as wicked?
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160]   What is wicked?"
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.360]   Of course, how many have seen the theater show Wicked?
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.680]   It's really good.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.640]   It is incredibly good.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.640]   It's interesting.
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.680]   It tells a very powerful story that I won't spoil it for those who, please, do go see
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:08.680]   it.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.440]   The question is, "What is wicked to you?
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.400]   What's your definition as wicked?"
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.220]   As you look at someone, what threshold do you have?
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.760]   What ticks do you need to go through before you go, "Okay, that person is wicked."
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.760]   What is wicked?
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.120]   What is evil to you?
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.760]   When I just said that word, "evil," what comes up in your mind?
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.000]   What's evil?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   What are the things that are evil to you?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.280]   Did God create evil?
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   Did God create evil?
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.440]   The truth is, no, because God created everything.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.280]   What did He call everything when He created it?
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.400]   He said, "It is good."
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.960]   So evil really isn't a thing.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.600]   It's just like darkness and light.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.720]   Darkness isn't really anything.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.840]   Darkness is simply the absence of light.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.840]   Darkness itself isn't a thing.
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.560]   It's simply that there is no light around there.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.760]   So evil, in the same way, isn't really a thing.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:09.400]   It is simply just something that has been corrupted, something that has been twisted.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.480]   Augustine and C.S. Lewis, Clive Staple Lewis, both say this.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.320]   Evil, wickedness, is basically the corruption of a good thing.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   That's what it is.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:24.280]   God created this world and He called it good, yet for us, we have corrupted it.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   That's what we did.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.880]   There's this famous book by C.S. Lewis, a couple that I'm going to quote today, because
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.000]   actually this topic, "God, why is there suffering if you are really that powerful, if you are
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   really that loving?"
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.080]   C.S. Lewis, being a very intelligent man, before he was a Christian, would go to all
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.320]   his academic friends in Oxford and Cambridge and challenge them on this.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.920]   If your God is all loving and if your God is all knowing, then why is there still such
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.000]   suffering and evil in the world?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.240]   It's the Epicurean paradox.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:55.000]   It's a Greek philosophy paradox, which is, wait, if He is God and He is all loving and
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.800]   He is all knowing, then why is there still so much rubbish that is happening?
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:04.600]   Surely that means He is incompetent or disinterested, right?
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600]   That's the paradox.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.160]   And C.S. Lewis would keep asking his Christian friends this until he finally found the answer.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.320]   And I'll let him explain it more to you, but before that, he writes this book called "The
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.320]   Screwtape Letters."
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.440]   It's a very interesting book and it's a satirical novel, okay?
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.880]   So it's not actually happening.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.200]   He doesn't have any specific divine revelation on this is happening, but "The Screwtape Letters"
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.480]   is about Screwtape, who is a senior demon.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:38.520]   He's a senior demon and he's writing letters to one of his young demons, trying to train
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.520]   his young demon.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.120]   What's he trying to train him to do?
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.360]   He's trying to train him how to distract humans from God.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.560]   So that's the book, that's what it's all about.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.400]   So Screwtape writes him these letters.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.040]   And there's this one passage which I thought I must read to you because it is really interesting.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.880]   So Screwtape here is the senior demon and he's writing to his understudy and he says
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   this.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.880]   He said, "You know what?
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.960]   God is a hedonist at heart.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.540]   He makes no secret of it.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.160]   At his right hand are pleasures forevermore.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.160]   He's vulgar, Wormwood."
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.400]   Wormwood is his understudy.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   He's vulgar.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.320]   "He has a bourgeois mind.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.880]   He has filled his world full of pleasures.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.000]   There are things for humans to do all day long.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:25.680]   Sleeping, and washing, and eating, and drinking, and making love, playing, praying, working.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:31.180]   Everything has to be twisted before it's any use to us."
[00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.480]   Everything has to be twisted before it's any use to us.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.400]   God did not create evil.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.640]   There is no such thing as evil.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.520]   There is simply good things that have been twisted.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.600]   Good things that have been corrupted.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.560]   It's a good world that's gone wrong.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.320]   Fire is a good thing.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.760]   It keeps us warm.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.960]   It helps us cook our food so we don't have salmonella.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.740]   But if used wrongly, it can be used for explosives to kill people.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.680]   Water is an essential ingredient of life.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.000]   We need water to survive.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.920]   And water can also be used to drown someone.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.600]   Evil simply is the corruption of a good thing.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:18.880]   Evil is the corruption of a good thing.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.040]   And when did it start?
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.080]   When did evil enter?
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.160]   The moment in the garden with Adam and Eve.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.200]   The fall.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:32.760]   If good, if everything is good because we choose God, we follow what God is asking us
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.960]   to do, we use the things that God has designed them for, then we're good.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.000]   But the moment we choose something else, the moment we choose to use it for our own desires,
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.320]   then it becomes evil, it becomes sin.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.600]   And that's what Adam and Eve did.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.040]   God said, "Here it is.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.040]   This is the garden.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.040]   This is your creation.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.480]   You can live in my presence for eternity and you can enjoy all of this."
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.120]   But then they chose a different way.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.880]   And so at that point, wickedness enters in.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.000]   God had designed the garden, had designed Adam and Eve to live forever.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.820]   But unfortunately, they chose another way.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.840]   Just like we choose another way.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:09.200]   So the question really is this, as we challenge ourselves to think, "What is really evil?
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.840]   What's actually wicked?"
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:17.080]   The first thing we have to realise is actually, we have it within us.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.080]   We have it in us.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.160]   Before we start labelling, "Oh, that person is wicked.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.600]   That person is evil."
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   There is no such thing.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.120]   If there is no such thing as wicked, then there is only such a thing as a person choosing
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.000]   to carry out evil deeds.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.600]   There is only a person who is choosing to do this, choosing to be wicked.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.040]   But there are no inherently wicked people in that sense.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.120]   Which also means that actually, that has a repercussion for all of us.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.720]   The Apostle Paul in Romans 3 says this.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.280]   He says, "There's no distinction.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.720]   You looking over there, pointing down at that person.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.200]   There is no distinction.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.080]   We all fall short of the glory of God.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.080]   All of us.
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.620]   There is wickedness in all of us."
[00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.000]   So before we point that finger and say, "That person is wicked."
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.240]   I mean that cheesy thing is, every time you point a finger out, there's three fingers
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.320]   pointing back at you.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.360]   As believers, as we are surrounded by a world that is filled with wickedness, we have to
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.760]   remember that we cannot put that wickedness onto these people as that is their whole thing.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.280]   That is their whole being.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:29.320]   They are simply people that were designed for good, who have chosen otherwise.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.920]   And then we realise, "Oh actually, that's me as well.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:38.200]   There seems to be different levels of it, but actually there is wickedness in me."
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.280]   We first must look at ourselves.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.680]   Be careful that we don't have an inflated view of ourselves.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.040]   Jesus talks about this.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.060]   You keep looking over at your friend and saying, "There's a piece of dust in your eye when
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:51.040]   you ignore the fact that there's a plank in my eye."
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   So as I look at the news and I see all these bad, all these wicked people, I realise, "Goodness
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.240]   me, I think I need to change the way I look at this."
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.680]   Now it's not denying that there are evil acts that are being carried out, that there is
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:08.880]   wickedness in the world, but first I need to check, "Is there wickedness in me?"
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.840]   First I must see if there is any evil in me because there is simply no distinction.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:20.360]   We are truly all wicked in the sense that we carry out, we choose to do wicked acts.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.520]   Then the second question is this.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:27.400]   If I've decided that, okay, what wicked is, the second question I ask myself is, "Well,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.280]   what do I think they deserve?"
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:34.280]   Kohelet here is saying they are not getting punished and because of that their behaviour
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.360]   is carrying on.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.800]   There is delayed punishment or even worse, there is no punishment at all.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   What are we going to do with this?
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.240]   A commentator summarised this bit and this is one of the trickiest texts in this chapter
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.240]   and in the Bible.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.680]   And he summarises this.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:53.040]   What the preacher is trying to say here is there is no moral purpose working itself out
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   in human destiny.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.520]   Do you know we always have these things where when we do something good then we will get
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.920]   rewarded, we will have a better life.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.680]   When we do something bad, something will happen and we will get punished.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.560]   Ecclesiastes is saying there is no moral purpose working itself out in human destiny.
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.360]   Everything just happens.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.160]   And the preacher, the author here, is very frustrated with that because he sees wicked
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.800]   people that he is looking down on and he is waiting for them and asking, "Why are they
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.280]   not being punished?
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.800]   Why does God spare immediate judgement?"
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.800]   The problem here is this.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.360]   Once we have discerned that actually there is no actual wickedness, there is simply just
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   good people who are choosing to do wicked acts, we will start to understand why God
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.000]   doesn't give out immediate judgement.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.920]   If God did give immediate judgement, none of us would be here.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:47.680]   Because the moment we would do something small that is wrong, that is still wrong, we would
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.680]   be zapped.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:49.680]   We would be gone.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.960]   And we wouldn't even have a chance to do that because the moment Eve takes a bite from the
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.840]   apple and Adam takes a bite from the apple, Eve would be enough to wipe out the human
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.400]   race because then they wouldn't be able to reproduce.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.680]   God zaps her away, then there is only Adam left.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:05.680]   He is lonely.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.000]   Man can't look after himself.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.960]   So the human race dies.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.160]   God doesn't spare, God doesn't give out judgement immediately because he has a bigger plan.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.320]   And there is something else that we will talk about this later.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.720]   The question we have to ask ourselves is, as we look at these wicked acts, as we look
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.560]   at these people who we think should be punished, the question is, what do we think they should
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.700]   be punished with?
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.400]   What do we think they deserve?
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.800]   But maybe the real question is, why do we think they deserve judgement?
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:43.400]   What pride is in us as we look at someone who we deem as wicked and say, "That person
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.460]   needs to be judged, God needs to punish that person."
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.080]   What pride is there in us when we think that?
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.800]   Because as soon as you realise, "Oh, everyone was created for good, we just simply have
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.720]   the choice to choose this."
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.980]   Then you realise that actually it is a lot more complicated, it is a lot more layered
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.600]   than just, "If someone does something wrong, you punish them severely."
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.280]   Every person who has had children will know this.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:14.880]   Because it is not just as simple as the moment a kid does something wrong, that you just
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.400]   wipe them from the face of the earth.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.120]   It's not that simple.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:23.200]   There is the factor of love that we will explore a little bit more.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.280]   But the preacher here, Kohele here, is very annoyed.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.480]   He's saying, "These wicked people, they did all these bad things, but the moment they
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.880]   die, everyone forgets and they have the most wonderful funeral.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.160]   And everyone's praising them."
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.920]   Have we seen that before?
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.360]   When someone dies and suddenly everyone just has great things to say about this person,
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.200]   but actually when they were alive, they really were not that great at all.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.400]   And Kohele here is like, "That's not fair.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.800]   That's not good."
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:51.400]   And we look around at people and we see these people who are cheating people out of their
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.400]   money, their pensions.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.480]   You see these people who are just not looking after other people and yet they still get
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.800]   all the luxuries of life, they still get all the power, they still get all the fame and
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.200]   reputation.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.760]   And we're like, "That's not fair."
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.760]   Right?
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.560]   They're wicked people.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.440]   I'm the righteous one, yet I'm the one who's starving and I'm the one who's still slaving
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.160]   away where they seem to be living the life.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.960]   The question really for us then is, as we think about that, is what do we think they
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.520]   actually deserve?
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.800]   What high horse are we sitting on?
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.080]   But the second question is, actually those things that we see that they're getting praised
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.720]   for, Kohele, as he looks at these people who are getting praised at their funeral, getting
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.640]   all these earthly praises, actually deep down, is that what we desire?
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.960]   These rich people who still get to live all their lives even though they don't care for
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.680]   anyone, actually, secretly, is that what we desire?
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.800]   Those of us who are lower on the ladder, we keep looking at the top of the ladder going,
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.040]   "Oh, if I had that, then I would be better.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.040]   If I had the money that you had, I would be way more generous.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.040]   If I did that..."
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.680]   And then you're like, "Well, actually, how generous are you with what you have?"
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:05.400]   Again, before we point that finger, there are three fingers pointing back at us.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.760]   What do we even think is wicked?
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.680]   What do we think they actually deserve?
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   Where do you draw the line?
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680]   Let's talk about this.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.160]   Let's pretend to play God for a second here.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.160]   Let's wipe out evil in this world.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.640]   Who are the first group of people that you'd wipe out?
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.640]   You're all thinking it.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.240]   You're all thinking, "Well, we'll wipe out the murderers, right?
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:29.240]   The murderers, the tyrants, the dictators, the rapists.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.880]   Let's wipe those out.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880]   Get rid of those."
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.360]   But there's still evil in the world.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.360]   "Okay, well, okay.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.120]   Well, the top tier are gone now, so let's wipe out the second tier."
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.600]   Who are the second tier?
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.600]   The bankers?
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:48.640]   "Let's wipe out the second tier of people, people who harm each other.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.280]   They fight and they...
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.720]   Maybe they don't rape people, but maybe they cheat on their wife.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   Maybe let's wipe those out.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.240]   They're still bad."
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.000]   And you're like, "Okay, well, wait, there's still evil in the world.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.400]   Okay, well, actually, let's just wipe out the people who don't do any good for other
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400]   people.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.680]   They just look after themselves."
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.760]   It's a slippery slope, isn't it?
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:15.360]   When we're asking God, "Why are you sparing judgment on them?"
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.960]   The real question is, "Why is he still sparing judgment on us?"
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.380]   Because we're on that list somewhere.
[00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:26.400]   We all fall short of the glory of God, the holiness of God.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:33.240]   We might not be 99% doing bad things all the time, but we're definitely not completely
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.840]   perfect.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.880]   So the question then becomes, "What do we think they actually deserve?"
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.440]   There is no distinction.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.320]   We all fall short of the glory of God.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:48.680]   In fact, because we live in a broken world, we know that even the most evil people, the
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.040]   people who are doing the most evil acts, often because of the broken world that they grew
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.600]   up in, they are victims of the broken society themselves.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:03.000]   If you watch the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and you watch all the villains that every
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.240]   movie has, there's always a backstory, right?
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:13.860]   There's always a backstory of why that person that was created for good became bad.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:17.700]   Because they themselves were victims of a broken society.
[00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.960]   They themselves were victims of abuse.
[00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.840]   They themselves were victims of failure and deep trauma and hurt.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:31.480]   So before we point the finger, once again, as believers, challenge ourselves, "Wait,
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.480]   wait.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   What is wicked?
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.820]   What is evil?
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.820]   What do I think they deserve?
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:40.040]   I don't know, because I know what I deserve, and I didn't get it, so I'm just going to
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.320]   stay in my lane."
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.400]   Let us think about that.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.400]   Let us challenge that.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:49.980]   And you see, Kohala here actually isn't annoyed at the wicked people.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:55.220]   He's not even annoyed at the people in the city who are praising the wicked people at
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.220]   the funeral.
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:58.400]   Who's he annoyed at?
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.080]   He's annoyed at God himself.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:06.820]   Because he's like, "God, you can do something about this, yet you're not doing anything.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:11.760]   And because you're not doing anything, they're simply getting worse."
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.460]   So the final question that I realized as I was pointing the finger, as I was thinking
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.500]   about all these things about why there is such evil in the world, I realized the question
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:24.700]   that I needed to ask was, "How do I actually see God?
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.280]   How do you see God?
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:31.580]   When it comes to sin, when it comes to evil, how do I actually see God?"
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.020]   You see, Kohala's answer to all of this, he ends up giving up and just saying, "You know
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.020]   what?
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.020]   I've seen so much.
[00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.020]   You know what?
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:41.720]   The only thing I can really do is eat, drink, be merry, and fear God."
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.900]   That's what I'm going to do.
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.820]   The key here is, what does he mean by fearing God?
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:49.780]   When he says, "Okay, you know what?
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.740]   Let's just fear God."
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:58.060]   Fear God means to fully recognize who God actually is.
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.140]   Because we often have a distorted image of who God is.
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.860]   We think He's the great punisher.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.340]   Every time we do something wrong, we think He's going to slap us on our hands.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.020]   Every time something bad happens to us, we're like, "What did I do wrong?
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.260]   Maybe I bought something and put it into the house that was wrong.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:16.800]   Maybe I said an unkind word to someone.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.340]   Maybe I didn't do something nice, and so God's punishing me now."
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:23.260]   Don't we have that perspective sometimes?
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.760]   And yet, that's because we have a wrong perspective of God Himself.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:34.340]   When we truly fear God, what he's saying is, we truly understand who He actually is, how
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:41.460]   wonderfully kind and gracious He is, how loving He is.
[00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:46.820]   The preacher here is saying, there's two kinds of people, and it's not wicked and righteous.
[00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.660]   It's those who fear God and those who don't.
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:52.380]   Because we all fall short.
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.580]   The question really is, are you in the camp that fears God, that knows who He is, that
[00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.020]   reveres Him, that trusts Him and loves Him?
[00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:03.980]   Or are you in the camp that actually don't fear Him at all?
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.360]   Those are the kinds of people that are in this world.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.580]   And there's this passage in the New Testament that really talks about this as well.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:13.980]   To Peter, Peter is hearing the same things, because he's talking about, the passage just
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.580]   before this, he's saying, "There are scoffers around you who are saying, 'Where's your God?
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:20.860]   Where's the judgment?
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:26.900]   If your God is so big and He's so holy, why isn't He coming to destroy us all now?'"
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.360]   Very similar to Noah, back in his day, when he was building that ark.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.740]   The people were like, "Where is your God?
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:33.740]   What are you doing?
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.740]   This is so stupid.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:35.740]   This is stupid.
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.740]   It's not even raining.
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.740]   It's sunny.
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.620]   Where is your God?"
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.220]   And yet in the day of Noah, the judgment came through flood.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.540]   And soon, one day, there will be a second judgment that will come via fire.
[00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:52.300]   And Peter is talking to the people and saying, "Hey, look, those who are scoffing, ignore
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:53.300]   them.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.900]   Those who are scoffing, thinking, 'Where is your God?
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.900]   Why isn't He giving judgment?'"
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.740]   He's saying, "No, do not overlook this one fact.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.980]   Remember this one thing, beloved, that with the Lord one day is a thousand years and a
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.820]   thousand years as one day.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.860]   The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.260]   you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance."
[00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.460]   Do not overlook this one fact.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.460]   This is the one thing about God that you need to know.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.700]   And for even those of us who believe, we need to know this.
[00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.180]   We need to remember this.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.300]   God is yes.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   He is holy.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.740]   And yes, He will judge.
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.060]   And yes, He is fair.
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:34.580]   But above all, God is love.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.940]   Jesus said Himself, "I didn't come to judge.
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.300]   I came to save."
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:46.260]   And until we get that into our minds, until we understand who God truly is, we will look
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.540]   at other people in the wrong way.
[00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:54.500]   The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise because a thousand years is like one day to
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.500]   Him.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.500]   What does that mean?
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.720]   He stands above time.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.180]   So we think, "God, why are you still letting that madman run that country?
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.060]   Why are you still letting that person do what they're doing?
[00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.720]   It's been five years!"
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.900]   And then you look at the book of Judges and you see that the Israelites get ruled over
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:18.980]   by the Babylonians for 80 years at a time.
[00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.900]   And you realize that actually God is working on a different time frame.
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:25.460]   The question here is, do we trust Him?
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.440]   That's what it's all about, right?
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.820]   So often we talk to God and say, "Look, where are we going with this?
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.860]   Where are you going with this project?
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.300]   Tell us where your destination is and tell us when you're going to get there.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.120]   Because I need to know the ending of the story.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.180]   I need to know that this bad guy eventually gets punished."
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.180]   And God's saying, "No.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.300]   Do you know my heart?
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.680]   Do not overlook this.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.580]   If you do, then trust me.
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.880]   Oh, I do trust you, God.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.880]   I do trust you.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.340]   But I just want to know where the ending is."
[00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.540]   Well, if you want to know where the ending is, then you don't really trust me.
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:03.260]   So the key here for us is, do we truly trust and believe who God is and do we truly fear Him?
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:06.360]   He is not sparing judgment out of indifference.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.600]   He is not sparing judgment out of incompetence.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.940]   He is sparing judgment out of patience.
[00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:21.660]   And aren't we all so grateful that He is patient to us?
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:26.400]   Aren't we all so grateful that He didn't send a lightning bolt down the first time we made
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.580]   a mistake?
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:34.060]   Which was actually when we were a baby.
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.000]   Aren't we glad that He is patient to us?
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:44.060]   So if He is patient to us, then what's our job when it comes to talking about the wicked?
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:50.060]   He is patient to us because He loves us.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.420]   And He doesn't want us to compare.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:55.740]   He doesn't want us to look across at the other side and go, "What about them?
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.740]   What about the wicked?"
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.780]   That's not what He wants.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.860]   And this is where Kohelet is right.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.220]   I've seen all of this.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.220]   It's unfair.
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:04.220]   It's unright.
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.220]   It's confusing to me.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.220]   I don't understand it.
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:07.220]   You know what?
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.620]   I must just fear God.
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:09.620]   I'll eat.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:10.620]   I'll drink.
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:11.620]   I'll be merry.
[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.660]   What is he saying?
[00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.900]   You know what?
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.040]   My understanding is limited.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:22.180]   I don't know why God isn't dealing with that person.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.900]   But my understanding is limited so I will stay in my lane.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.160]   And my lane is to fear Him.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.160]   Is to love Him.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:34.960]   Christina and I, we have the honour of counselling couples.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.560]   Couples who are just about to get married, who are just married.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:43.720]   And they're kind of going through the conflicts of early marriage or any years, I guess.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.240]   There's always conflicts in marriage.
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:50.240]   And then there's scripture that says, "Wives, submit to your husbands."
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.240]   And then the wife is like, "Oh."
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.400]   And the husband is like, "Oh, she's not submitting to me."
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.380]   And then the scripture is like, "Husbands, love your wives."
[00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:04.400]   And then the wife is like, "I can't submit to him because he doesn't love me."
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.400]   And I found it interesting.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.720]   And at one time I was sharing this.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   It wasn't that long ago.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   I was like, "You know what?
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.560]   There's a reason why it says, 'Wives, submit to your husbands.'"
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:16.040]   Because at that moment, Paul is talking to the wives.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:20.280]   He's not talking to the husbands and saying, "Husbands, your wives will submit to you."
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.280]   Unconditionally.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.160]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.600]   He's not saying, "Wives, your husbands will love you."
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:27.600]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:33.600]   He's talking to each one and he's saying, "Wives, submit to your husbands.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.600]   Follow their lead."
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.760]   "Husbands, love your wives."
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.600]   That doesn't mean that you just get to make all the decisions because she's submitting
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   to you.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:48.880]   It means you get to die first because love is to die, is to lay yourself down.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.160]   That's the greatest example of love, right?
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.040]   So husbands are like, "Oh, I get to leave and my wife gets to submit to you."
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.040]   Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.200]   But you also get to die first, which means when you're arguing, you get to be the one
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.720]   that says sorry first.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.400]   You get to be the one that lays down your own preferences first.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:12.760]   Wives, you get to submit to your husbands because he loves you, also because you're
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.200]   trusting that he will submit to God.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.360]   But we must stay in our lanes.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.800]   We must not look at, "You're not loving me."
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:23.560]   Let's just focus on, "Am I doing the thing that God's?"
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.040]   We should avoid the comparison.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.760]   We should avoid looking across and going, "What about them?"
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.960]   God's saying, "Look at me."
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:34.400]   The final story is I'm reminded of Jesus.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.920]   You see, Jesus, I'm sure you've heard of him.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.600]   He comes to earth, Prince of Heaven, comes to earth, he dies, and then he resurrects.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.440]   And then he goes to meet Peter, who has just messed up.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.760]   He lied about knowing Jesus.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.120]   And then he restores Peter by the fireplace in this really intimate setting.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.760]   And he's saying, "Peter, do you love me?
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.760]   Do you love me?
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:55.760]   Do you love me?"
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.760]   And then Peter says, "Yes, I do.
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   Yes, I do.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.760]   Yes, I do."
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.760]   And then he says, "Well, feed my sheep.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.760]   Feed my sheep.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   Look after my sheep."
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   And then he says, "Actually, something bad's going to happen to you.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:12.680]   You're going to end up giving your life to the gospel."
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.640]   And then Peter does the funny thing.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.680]   Well, he's of course humbled because he made some mistakes.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.000]   And then he does this thing and he says, "Well, okay, fine.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.240]   But God, what about him?
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.160]   Do you know that bit?"
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.120]   He looks across and goes, "What about that guy?
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.800]   If I have to die, what about him?"
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.280]   And then Jesus says this just brutally honest and direct response.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.040]   He says, "What is that to you?
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.260]   If I let him live forever, what is that to you?"
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.040]   He's telling Peter, "Stay in your lane.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.520]   You love me.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.320]   You keep your eyes on me.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   You serve me.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.480]   You feed my sheep.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.800]   You follow me.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.120]   Don't worry about the rest."
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.360]   Because there's a danger.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.680]   As soon as we start looking across into another lane, as soon as we start comparing, as soon
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.120]   as we start judging, "Oh, that person's wicked.
[00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.200]   Oh, that person's doing this.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:05.280]   I think that person deserves this," we have lost our bearings once again.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:11.520]   We've taken our eyes away from God and onto these other people.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.480]   Let us not overlook the fact that God transcends time.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.360]   He is not fazed by any evil empire, any institution, any bad person.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:24.080]   He is not fazed by any of them.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:30.160]   But he is patient because ultimately he doesn't want anyone to perish.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.760]   That's the heart that we hold onto.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:37.640]   That's the thing that we benefit from, his grace to us.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:46.480]   Therefore we can fear him, eat, drink, be merry, despite us being surrounded by a wicked
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.800]   world.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.440]   We don't need to ask the question, "What is wicked?" because we have a good shepherd who
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.760]   will look after us.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:59.680]   We have a good shepherd who examines us and sees the wickedness in us.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:06.160]   And yet he welcomes us in despite our wickedness.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.200]   That is God.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.520]   So I finish by asking you those same questions again.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:16.760]   How do you, what do you think is wicked?
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:21.440]   What do you think they deserve?
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:28.720]   And before you think about them, let us think about us.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:34.840]   And let us turn our eyes to the good shepherd who we can ultimately completely trust because
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.600]   we know he is in complete control.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:45.840]   That is how a Christian, a follower of Christ, navigates this confusing, dark world.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:54.640]   So let us eat, let us drink, let us be joyful and be merry, and let us fear our God because
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.640]   of who he is.
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:56.640]   Let us pray.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:13.700]   So Father, we come before you with confusion sometimes, with frustration.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:20.340]   Because we look around at the world and we see that it's just not what it should be.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:24.620]   And our hearts break because it's fallen.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:29.020]   People are hurting each other.
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:34.460]   And yet Lord, we pray that your Spirit would show us how we should truly live.
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:40.780]   That you would show us, you would remind us of your heart.
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:50.620]   So as we are face to face with wickedness, as we are face to face with hurt, that we
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:56.620]   would not approach it with pride, but we would approach it with the same love that you had
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:59.020]   for us.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:04.060]   God, we seek your face.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.420]   We want to know who you truly are.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:11.540]   And we do not overlook the fact that you transcend time itself.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:21.820]   And that you are not slow to bring judgment, but that you are patient so that we would
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.820]   not perish.
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:26.780]   And for that we are grateful.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:27.780]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:30.620]   You are the good shepherd in whom we trust.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.300]   We turn our eyes to you.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.300]   It's in your name we pray.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:35.800]   Amen.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
