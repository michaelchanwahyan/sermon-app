[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.800]   This weekend in the Christian calendar is Pentecost.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.320]   And tomorrow churches all around the world will be celebrating Pentecost.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.800]   I've got a little admission to make for you.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.160]   I don't know how you felt about last Sunday's sermon with Joyce.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.680]   It really impacted me.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.720]   And I'm sitting at home on Sunday and I tore up my sermon for today.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.720]   I wrote it again.
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.520]   Sandra will tell you.
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.520]   And I wanted to change that sermon in the light of firstly her message and secondly
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.240]   in the light of Pentecost.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.520]   So my sermon title is "Serving Makes a Difference" to which I've added, and I've put it on the
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.360]   screen, "Serving in the Light of Pentecost."
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.120]   Now let me tell you what I'm talking about.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.560]   Most Christians could not imagine having a year go by without celebrating the holidays
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.020]   of Christmas and Easter.
[00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:26.200]   The church Christian calendar is not complete without the observance of these two events.
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.200]   Christmas is the event that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.760]   his ministry.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:45.560]   Easter celebrates the resurrection of Jesus and God's ultimate victory over sin and death.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:55.400]   Imagine a year with no Christmas turkey and no Easter eggs.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.960]   Imagine a year with no songs like "O Holy Night" or "Christ the Lord is risen today"
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.000]   or the 2023 version "Friday's good but Sunday's coming."
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:21.240]   However, there is a third holiday, a third observance, a third sacred event central to
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:28.000]   our understanding of what it means to be a Christian and what it means to belong to the
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.120]   church.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.440]   Though many Christians do not celebrate this event, and some may never have heard of it
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:46.420]   or know little about it, that third event is called Pentecost Sunday.
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.360]   The third great day in the Christian calendar is rooted in the story of Acts chapter 2 and
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.040]   celebrates the day when the Holy Spirit descended on the apostles who were gathered in a room
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.080]   in Jerusalem.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:12.540]   Some people mistakenly believe the observance of Pentecost has meaning only for those Christians
[00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.800]   who call themselves Pentecostals.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:24.560]   The truth is the history of the Christian church stretches back more than 2,000 years,
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:32.920]   while the Pentecostal movement did not emerge in its fullness until the turn of the 20th
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.480]   century.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   Pentecost Sunday is 1,900 years older than Christians who call themselves Pentecostals.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.880]   In other words, observing the day of Pentecost is no more a possession of Pentecostals than
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.480]   observing baptism is the possession only of those who call themselves Baptists.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:15.000]   However, Pentecost and baptism are gifts that God gave to the whole church, to the whole
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.520]   body of Christ.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.160]   Pentecost began as and remains one of the major holidays in the Jewish calendar that
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.580]   occurs 50 days after Passover.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.840]   The word Pentecost literally means 50th or 50th day.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.080]   The Jews, Pentecost was the time when they celebrated the first harvest of the agricultural
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080]   year.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.800]   I guess Americans have Thanksgiving, we Brits have harvest festival.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.680]   It was a time when they gave thanks to God for what the land had produced and for what
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.120]   their labor had yielded.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:05.140]   For Christians, Pentecost marks the birth of the Christian church.
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.920]   The day when Peter preached and in response to that sermon, there was a harvest of 3,000
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.560]   souls converted.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:26.020]   Before Pentecost, the disciples were hiding from the public for fear that what had happened
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.040]   to Jesus might also happen to them.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.940]   But look what happened to the apostles after the Pentecost.
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:43.300]   Those frightened men had become suddenly and miraculously equipped and empowered to carry
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:51.700]   on the ministry that Jesus had begun in the very city of Jerusalem where Jesus had recently
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.660]   been put to death.
[00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:03.180]   Peter, he's one of my favorites, 53 days earlier, 53 days, right?
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.860]   Had said about Jesus, I never knew him.
[00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:15.180]   Was the same Peter who preached the very first sermon in Acts 2.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:23.260]   Peter on the day of Pentecost stood before a crowd of the same people he once feared.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.540]   Yet he boldly declared the gospel of Christ.
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:35.560]   Peter stood before many of the same people who had shouted, "Crucify him!"
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:43.920]   On the day Jesus stood before Pontius Pilate in the city of Jerusalem.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:55.780]   Now Peter declared that the man they ordered to be crucified was in fact the Son of God.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.640]   How did Peter go from being frightened to being fearless?
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:07.180]   How did Peter go from being cowardly to being courageous?
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:14.600]   How did Peter go from denying Jesus to defending Jesus before the very same people in the very
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.480]   same place?
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.240]   Peter did not simply change his mind.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.300]   Peter himself was changed.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.400]   Something happened to Peter and the other apostles.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:42.600]   Pentecost marks the outpouring of the Holy Spirit by which human beings are equipped
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.640]   to do the work of God.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.760]   I've put this on the screen.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.620]   We've sung this already tonight.
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:56.920]   The church of Christ was born and the Spirit lit the flame.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.560]   Let's read the account, Acts chapter 2.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.800]   When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.600]   Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind and it filled the entire
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.440]   house where they were sitting and divided tongues of fire appeared to them and they
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.300]   rested on each one of them.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:24.040]   And they all were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.620]   Spirit gave them utterance.
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:32.800]   Now they were dwelling in Jerusalem, Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.840]   And at this sound, the multitude came together and they were bewildered because each one
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.920]   was hearing them speak in his own language.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:49.800]   And they were amazed and astonished saying, "Aren't these all Galileans?"
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.160]   How is it that they hear?
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:09:01.160]   We hear each of us in his own native language.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:06.080]   Consider these three events this way.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:15.520]   If Christmas marks the birth of Jesus, Pentecost marks the birth of the church.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:23.840]   If Easter marks the day when Jesus was raised from the dead, Pentecost marks the day when
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:32.400]   that message about Jesus began to make its way to people and places all over the world,
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.840]   even to the Far East Finance Center in Aberdeen.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:46.920]   When Peter told the gospel message of Jesus Christ for the very first time, people became
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.880]   ready, became ready to respond to the call.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.480]   Let's read it.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.240]   Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.080]   the apostles, "Brothers, what should we do?"
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:07.760]   And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:14.280]   for the forgiveness of your sin, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:21.440]   For this promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:25.640]   the Lord our God calls to himself."
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:31.360]   And with many other words, he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, "Save
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   yourself from this crooked generation."
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:43.720]   So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about 3,000
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   souls.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:56.000]   Church, that we have failed to understand or observe this day on the calendar does not
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.480]   change the basic truth this day holds for every believer.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.720]   Remember that in Acts chapter 1, verses 6 to 8, Jesus tells the apostles to remain in
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:12.600]   the city of Jerusalem until the power of the Holy Spirit came on them.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:19.200]   He was not sending them out to evangelize on the basis of their life experience or their
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.080]   understanding of religious laws and teaching.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:28.140]   He was not suggesting that spending three years in his presence had resulted in them
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.920]   being equipped for the work that lay ahead.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:39.280]   Instead, he told them to wait, wait for the power, wait for the anointing, wait for the
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   Holy Spirit to come upon them.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.320]   And once they had that power, they would be ready to go.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:52.240]   But until that happened, wait.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.980]   Pentecost Sunday is the day we remember when and how that anointing took place.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:04.240]   The work of the church in the world as an agent of reconciliation and evangelism had
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.240]   begun.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:10.800]   I've thought about this.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:18.240]   What do you and I do on Christmas that is central to the story?
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.160]   Nothing.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.880]   There is nothing for us to do at Easter except celebrate and give thanks for the work that
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.480]   Christ has done on our behalf.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.240]   On Pentecost, however, all of that changes.
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   You and I are called away from our roles as spectators into the role of central characters
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:50.040]   in God's work of redemption and salvation.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:57.000]   As a result of Pentecost, we do not watch what somebody else is doing for God, but are
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.040]   being equipped by the power of the Holy Spirit so that we can become actively involved in
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.440]   the work of Christ.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.820]   That's what Pentecost is about.
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:17.640]   It's the day that Jesus officially transfers to his disciples the responsibility of continuing
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.880]   his work.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.920]   The disciples were no longer spectators.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:28.480]   The time had come for them to do the work themselves.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.400]   It's one thing to watch while somebody else does all the work.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.580]   There's a few churches like that.
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.760]   It's another matter to do the job yourself.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:51.800]   However, that is what God called those disciples to do on the day of Pentecost.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:14:01.760]   Now I expect the question you're asking, "What has all this got to do with our focus on serving?"
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.480]   It hit me.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.680]   It hit me last week as Joyce was speaking.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:18.600]   Remember, Joyce had admitted preferring her comfortable life, air conditioning.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   I think she mentioned sashimi on a few occasions, right?
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.760]   Sashimi.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:36.160]   She preferred that to serving as a missionary in Africa.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.800]   What made the difference?
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.400]   I believe it is the spirit of Pentecost.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.480]   We saw this week, I've put a picture on the screen.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480]   Let's have a picture.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   Bless her.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.680]   I was really taken by this lady, I tell you.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:15:02.640]   This was a Hong Kong lady by her own admission, a spoiled Hong Kong child, right?
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:11.200]   Standing before us, speaking so powerfully by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.800]   We saw this with Susanna five weeks ago.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.480]   We saw this with Mr. Green three weeks ago.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.680]   And we look forward to welcoming Alia from Mother's Choice next week.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:34.240]   I sincerely believe that we as a church are being called to serve the community.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:44.400]   I've said this so many times that I want to see every one of us involved, not just the
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.320]   same usual volunteers.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:57.760]   The truth is, rather like Joyce, we cannot do this in our own strength.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.880]   If we try, we will fail.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:10.120]   But the good news is that God's Spirit, the same Spirit that was poured out on the disciples
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:16.200]   at Pentecost, will equip us to serve.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:22.160]   Let's just take a closer look at what the Holy Spirit does in us.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:28.280]   Firstly, the Holy Spirit does an inward work in us.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:36.480]   He is the one who administers justification, regeneration, and gives us new birth in our
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.560]   lives.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:44.080]   He is the one who cleanses us within, who comforts us, who bears witness with our spirit
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.920]   that we are children of God.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:53.560]   Secondly, the Holy Spirit does an upward work in us.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:17:01.720]   Jesus says of the Holy Spirit, "He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.880]   it to you."
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:14.160]   The Holy Spirit is forever pointing us heavenward to glorify Jesus and the Father.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:19.240]   And thirdly, the Holy Spirit does an outward work in us.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:25.960]   The empowerment that took place on the day of Pentecost resulted in a powerful gospel
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:34.220]   witness and 3,000 people from a variety of backgrounds were radically saved.
[00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:45.280]   The gospel went out to Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.080]   These times in which we live, these are exciting times.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:57.760]   We're another embodiment of the spirit of Pentecost as God is once again pouring out
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.620]   his Spirit upon our sons and daughters.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:10.560]   We need to embrace this aspect of the power and purpose of Pentecost.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:16.680]   And it is that outward work I want to concentrate on just for a few moments.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:22.200]   Many people have their own versions of what Pentecost is all about, and I'm not going
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.120]   into them now, and I'm going to say there's nothing wrong with any of this.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.560]   But can I give you my own definition?
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.640]   And it's this.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:40.760]   The power and purpose of Pentecost is demonstrated in a life of serving.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:46.560]   It may surprise you I've come up with that.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:55.200]   The power and purpose of Pentecost is demonstrated in a life of serving.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.920]   I picked a couple of verses from the series that we've been looking at just to repeat
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.040]   them to you.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.840]   The first one from Ephesians, "For we are God's masterpiece."
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.800]   I picked the New Living Translation because I love that word "masterpiece."
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.360]   We are God's masterpiece.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.120]   Other versions say workmanship.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:20.120]   He has created us anew in Christ Jesus so that we can do the good things he planned
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:22.560]   for us long ago.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   And from 1 Peter 4, each of you should use whatever gift you have to serve others as
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:37.800]   faithful stewards of God's grace in its various form.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:49.600]   Peter and Paul combine here to remind us that saved people serve people.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.480]   Saved people serve people.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.440]   You were saved at great cost.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:04.280]   You were saved by the sacrificial blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:12.480]   You were saved at a great cost for a great purpose.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:21.280]   But it is his life-giving, life-changing spirit, the spirit of Pentecost that empowers us.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:32.720]   And I need to tell you that serving others is a life-changing experience.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:38.480]   God through his spirit works through us to make a difference in the life of the one being
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:46.960]   served while also making a difference in the life of the person doing the serving.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.800]   Serving makes a difference in many ways.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:21:01.600]   Number one, serving makes a difference in the life of the one being served.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:09.400]   Remember last week we prayed for the team in Cambodia, the end of service?
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:17.120]   We've been getting daily reports from Johnny of how these people, these young people are
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.160]   making a difference with the young people in Cambodia and the church out there.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:28.880]   As I say, Johnny's been updating us every day and yesterday he wrote this.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.880]   I'll give you a spoiler alert, this will excite you.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:41.320]   But today we took a step of faith and at the end of each class we gave students an opportunity
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:48.040]   to become friends with Jesus by inviting him into their lives as Lord and Savior.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:54.260]   And almost every student prayed the prayer.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:22:03.760]   In total, we saw over 300 students pray to ask Jesus into their life.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:15.960]   If that's not worth a round of applause, I don't know what is.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:24.200]   But serving also makes a difference in the life of the one serving.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:32.920]   Pastor Johnny informs me that the major impact of this trip will be in those young people
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.920]   themselves.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.120]   The three young people you prayed for a week ago.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.120]   I'll be honest with you, I know churches would have said we only got three signed up for
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.040]   it, let's cancel the trip.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.380]   It's not worth a week of Johnny's time.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.640]   You prayed last week.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.560]   Michelle got up here and said, actually, these four people are going on a mission trip, but
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.920]   you're all on the mission trip.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.320]   Do you remember that?
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:14.100]   Over 300 students prayed to give their life to Jesus Christ.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.920]   Serving makes a difference in the life of one serving.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.960]   I know I've experienced myself.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:27.520]   My third point is the difference that serving makes is life-changing.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.600]   Let me expand.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.920]   We all want our lives to matter, right?
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.120]   I hope you do.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.720]   It's the reason we do the things we do.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:46.480]   We chase our promotions and leadership positions because we want to make a difference.
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:50.760]   We encourage our kids to go to college, get a good job, make lots of money in hopes that
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.600]   they do, will also make a difference.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:24:04.400]   There is nothing wrong with wealth or influence, but those things alone won't change the world.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.120]   And they aren't what we were made for.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:14.440]   We were made to build the church.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:24.120]   Do you remember in January, to prepare us for serving, we discussed equipping the saints.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.120]   I'll read it again.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.400]   "And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds, and teachers to
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:36.080]   equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ until we
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:42.120]   all attain to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood,
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.840]   to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:57.800]   God made each one of us with unique talents, personalities, unique skill sets.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:04.320]   We get the most joy and make the biggest difference when we use our God-given talents, gifts,
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.640]   and abilities to build the church.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.640]   Let's read on.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.320]   I love this.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:14.560]   "So that we may no longer be children tossed and thrown by the waves and carried about
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:20.600]   by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:26.840]   Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into Him who is the
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:34.720]   head into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:41.680]   which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.480]   itself up in love."
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:53.200]   As I close, I want to share eight ways.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.320]   It's a good number in Hong Kong, right?
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.600]   Eight ways.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.640]   It could have been seven, but it's eight ways.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:06.040]   Eight ways that serving makes a difference.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:16.720]   Number one, serving allows us to discover and develop our spiritual gifts.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:22.400]   1 Corinthians 12 compares the church to the human body.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:28.000]   Just like our body is made up of many parts serving specific functions, the church is
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.440]   made up of people with different skills and abilities.
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:43.360]   Alone, these pieces aren't very useful, but together we create something beautiful.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.480]   I need you, you need me, we need each other.
[00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:50.320]   Serving makes a difference.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.360]   Secondly, serving allows us to experience miracles.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.080]   If you remember a few weeks back, I spoke about John 2.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.200]   Jesus was at a wedding and a couple were running out of wine for its guests.
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.720]   He tells the servants to fill several big jars to the brim.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:11.040]   When they served the water to the guests, it was wine.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.680]   The guests never knew what happened.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.640]   The servants were the one who witnessed the miracle.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.160]   I'll say it again, it's important.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.840]   The servants were the ones who witnessed the miracle.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.400]   The same is true for us when we serve.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.000]   My friends, serving makes a difference.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.120]   Number three, serving allows us to experience the joy and peace that comes from obedience.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.920]   One Peter 4 says, "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:51.440]   as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms, so that in all things, God
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:55.720]   may be praised through Jesus Christ."
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:01.440]   Serving is a form of worship.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:07.800]   Serving is a way to express gratitude for what Jesus has done for us and to share the
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:12.000]   love and grace that we've been given.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.160]   Serving makes a difference.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.920]   Number four, serving helps us to be more like Jesus.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.680]   We shift the focus off of ourselves and onto others through serving.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.360]   We begin to see others as Jesus sees them.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.640]   And we see Jesus in others.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:37.960]   Matthew 25 says, "Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of these, the least of my
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.760]   brethren, you did it to me."
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.440]   Serving makes a difference.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:50.640]   Number five, serving surrounds us with other Christians who can help us follow Jesus.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:56.680]   When we're working side by side with other people, a bond inevitably forms.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.720]   That was part of God's plan for how the church is supposed to work.
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:06.960]   That's why Hebrews 10 says this, "Spur on, spur one another on towards love and good
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.800]   deeds, not giving up meeting together, but encouraging each other."
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.200]   Serving makes a difference.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:20.280]   Number six, serving encourages, sorry, serving increases our faith.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:30.120]   As we move out of our comfort zones, God increases our faith by revealing new potential in ourselves
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.160]   and in his church.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.480]   When we see what he can do with his power at work with us, we begin to look for doors
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.440]   he is opening rather than pushing our ways through the ones he's closed.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:50.360]   Ephesians 3:20 says, "Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all we can
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:56.280]   ask or think, according to the power at work within us."
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.840]   Serving makes a difference.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:06.560]   Number seven, serving allows us to experience God's presence in new ways.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.040]   Encouragement and healing go hand in hand.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.920]   As we encourage others and they find healing, we're encouraged.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:18.160]   It's the reason why so many people go on mission trips.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   Can I just say, if you get a chance to go on a mission trip, go!
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.040]   It will change you.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:35.880]   People come home feeling that they got more than they gave.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.520]   Serving makes a difference.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:42.560]   And lastly, serving is good for your soul.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:48.840]   Studies all over the world have shown that volunteering is so good for the mind and body.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.120]   It can ease symptoms of stress and depression.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:59.040]   Tapping into our gifts and passions builds self-confidence, energy, and strength.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:06.200]   Serving others can be the best distraction from our own worries.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:11.600]   Eight times, serving makes a difference.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:21.960]   But we make all sorts of rational explanations not to serve.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.120]   I don't have time.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.600]   I don't know what I would do.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.960]   I don't have any special skills to contribute.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.760]   They don't need me.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.640]   But the reality, and if you only pick one thing from this sermon, this is it.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:45.800]   The reality is that God doesn't call the equipped.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.320]   He equips the called.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.760]   Can I say that again? That's so important.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.840]   God doesn't call the equipped.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.800]   He equips the called.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:06.480]   God used men and women with similar doubts to change the course of history.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:16.600]   Joyce told us that Gideon, remember, was the weakest man in the weakest clan.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:23.200]   Yet God called him a mighty warrior and used him to defeat the Midianites.
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.040]   Moses, he didn't think he was a leader or a speaker.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.760]   He had a stutter.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:35.360]   But God worked through Moses to bring Israel out of slavery.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:41.920]   David was the youngest and therefore most significant of all his brothers.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:48.840]   But God worked through David to defeat a giant and eventually made him a king.
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:56.800]   Paul used to kill Christians before he met Jesus.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:06.880]   But he went on to become one of the most highly regarded and prolific writers and church planters in history.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:13.040]   God doesn't just want to work through you.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.800]   He wants to work in you.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.840]   Let me say it again. God doesn't just want to work through you.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:25.800]   He wants to work in you.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:31.720]   Yes, serving makes a difference.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.840]   But God calls you.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.960]   Who, me? Yes, you.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.840]   To make yourself available.
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:49.640]   Like Gideon, like Moses, like David and Paul.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:56.520]   Like the disciples on the day of Pentecost to be empowered by his spirit.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:04.560]   Together, we can, as the early disciples discovered, change the world.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.480]   Serving makes a difference.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:16.840]   Let us on this Pentecost weekend seek his fresh anointing.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.840]   Amen. Let's stand as the band comes back.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:44.680]   We're going to sing a very simple chorus in a moment.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.920]   it's one which those who've been brought up,
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.640]   maybe in the Anglican church will remember,
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.160]   is used at the end of a communion service
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.700]   and the words are very simple.
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:59.700]   Fill us up and send us out.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:06.020]   Fill us up and send us out.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.200]   Fill us up and send us out, Lord.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.780]   A lot of the church,
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:20.280]   fill us up so I can feel good.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.760]   Fill us up for all sorts of reasons.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:30.320]   Fill us up, Lord,
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.320]   and send us out in the power of your spirit.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:38.080]   If you're comfortable, just stretch your hands
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.480]   in front of you, I'm gonna pray
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.880]   and Paul's gonna sing to us.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.960]   (gentle piano music)
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:53.520]   Lord, on this special weekend,
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.300]   thank you for bringing to our mind
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.420]   that we need to be filled
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.380]   but that we need to be sent.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.400]   Holy Spirit, we need you.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.240]   We can do nothing without you.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:22.460]   Fill us afresh, we pray.
[00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:33.300]   And Lord, we pray that you'll commission us,
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.580]   that you'll send us to the poor, to the lonely,
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:43.420]   to the desperate, to the widow, to the orphan,
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.540]   to the refugee,
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:53.980]   to that person in the office who nobody talks to.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:37:03.260]   Fill us afresh.
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:08.540]   We need you.
[00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.940]   (gentle piano music)
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.500]   Fill us up and send us out.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.360]   [MUSIC]
