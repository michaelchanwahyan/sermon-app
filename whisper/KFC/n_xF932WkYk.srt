1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,400
 It's so good to be here tonight, and thank you, Pastor John, who's watching online from

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
 the UK.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
 We miss you.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,820
 We can't wait to see you soon.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,320
 But it's so good to be here tonight.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,960
 I've been part of the KFCI family officially for about six months, but we're all part of

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,680
 the family of God, so we've been family a long, long time.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,960
 Wouldn't you agree?

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:35,720
 I'm often asked how I ended up in Hong Kong, and behind me you see my beautiful family,

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,120
 my parents.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,280
 My brother is right beside me.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,120
 Beside him is my nephew, my brother-in-law, my sister, and my niece, Hope, on the end.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,860
 She's the jewel of our family.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,580
 But I'm often asked how I got here.

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,560
 How did I leave this beautiful group of people and end up here?

17
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,160
 Well, there's a long answer and a very, very short answer.

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,720
 We're going to go with option number two tonight, because number one could be like a whole sermon

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
 in itself.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,480
 So I'll give you the short version, kind of my origin story, if you will.

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,840
 When I was a little girl, probably less than five years old at that time, there was just

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
 me and my sister.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,800
 My dad was a young pastor starting out in the ministry.

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,120
 He had seen pastors lose their children.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,840
 He had seen pastors pour out their entire lives winning other people to the gospel,

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,200
 and their own children rebel and walk away from God.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,320
 And he could not bear the thought of losing his two little daughters.

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,280
 It was more than he could bear.

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,720
 So he began to pray, and prayed this prayer later when my brother came along.

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,800
 And his simple prayer was, "God, give me my children.

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,480
 God, I don't have to be a famous pastor.

32
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,520
 I don't have to pastor big, big churches.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,920
 I just want my children to grow up and know you and accept you for their own."

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,920
 Then he got even a little more bold in his prayer.

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,920
 And he said, "Lord, it would be okay with me if my children live on the other side of

36
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,840
 the world far away from me, if they know you and they're serving you.

37
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,040
 I would rather have them on the other side of the world than live next door to me and

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,720
 rebel against you and go to hell."

39
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,760
 So fast forward 30 plus years.

40
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,240
 My sister grew up to be a worship leader.

41
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,120
 And oh, little caveat, we never knew dad prayed that prayer.

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
 He didn't pray that prayer in front of us.

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,080
 That was his personal private plea with the Lord.

44
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,120
 So we didn't know it was a setup.

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
 My sister grew up to be a worship leader.

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,280
 My brother grew up to be a pastor.

47
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,520
 And me, here I am.

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,240
 When I came to my dad in my mid-30s and said, "I believe God's leading me to move to Hong

49
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,360
 Kong and to serve him there," part of his heart went, "Ugh, because I'm a daddy's girl.

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,680
 I'm still a daddy's girl.

51
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,120
 You're never too old to be a daddy's girl."

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,040
 And when I came to him and said, "God's called me to move to the other side of the world,"

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,320
 the Lord brought back to his remembrance the prayer that he had prayed when I was very

54
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
 little.

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,000
 And God asked him, "Did you really mean it?

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,880
 Did you really mean it when you prayed that?"

57
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,360
 Dad said, "Yes, I did."

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,720
 Then God said, "You have to bless her and let her go."

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
 So dad was obedient and blessed me and let me go.

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,760
 So since 2007, I've had the great privilege of serving the Lord here and based out of

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,320
 Hong Kong, but doing ministry all over Southeast Asia.

62
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,120
 And one of the passions of my heart is reaching people with the gospel and then equipping

63
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,320
 them to go to places that I can't go, because I can't go everywhere.

64
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,960
 I'm one person.

65
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,400
 You can't go everywhere.

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,880
 You're one person.

67
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,320
 But we can reach people who can go places we cannot.

68
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,440
 So tonight we're going to look at this topic of partnership with God.

69
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,200
 And that seems like such a high and lofty thing, especially when we think of it in the

70
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,280
 context of missions.

71
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,540
 We started a series recently in 1 Corinthians, and our first two scriptures tonight come

72
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,160
 out of 1 Corinthians.

73
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,560
 1 Corinthians 1.9 in the CEV says it like this, "God can be trusted, and he chose you

74
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,040
 to be partners with his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ."

75
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,480
 1 Corinthians 3.9 says, "For we are God's fellow workers.

76
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,820
 You are God's field, God's building."

77
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,360
 We have been chosen to partner with God.

78
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,000
 But partnership or working with God didn't start in the New Testament.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,040
 That's just not a New Testament thing.

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,060
 This was always God's plan.

81
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:01,880
 His desire was always from Genesis all the way to Revelation and continuing today.

82
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,100
 His plan and desire has always been to partner with us.

83
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:11,360
 In the book of Genesis, of course, from the very beginning, we have the account of creation.

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,640
 Day by day, God created the world.

85
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,400
 Out of nothing, he created everything.

86
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:26,300
 Land, ocean, water, river, streams, night, day, sun, moon, stars, animals that roam the

87
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,740
 earth, the fish in the sea, the birds in the air, God created it all.

88
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,440
 But the pinnacle of his creation was man.

89
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,980
 Man was made in God's very own image, and man is the only thing created that God blew

90
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,380
 his own breath into.

91
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,100
 God gave man a job.

92
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,780
 Genesis 2.15 says it like this, "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden

93
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,500
 of Eden to work it and take care of it."

94
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,580
 Now I have to wonder here, God just created the world.

95
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,980
 Was he not powerful enough to sustain the garden by himself?

96
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,180
 Did he really need somebody pulling the weeds?

97
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,260
 Did he really need somebody making sure it was nice and tidy?

98
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,340
 Of course not.

99
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,140
 Of course not.

100
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,440
 God had created it.

101
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,900
 He was powerful enough to sustain it on his own, but he chose to partner with man.

102
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,180
 He chose to work with Adam.

103
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,940
 He gave Adam a second job that we see recorded in verse 19 of the same chapter.

104
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,540
 "The Lord God formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the

105
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,620
 sky.

106
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,680
 He brought them to the man to see what he would name them.

107
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,100
 And whatever the man named each living creature, that was its name."

108
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,300
 Now I have a bit of a crazy imagination at times, so my mind kind of goes some places

109
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,180
 and I wonder things like, "How long did this take to name all the animals?"

110
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,980
 We're not talking about a zoo with like maybe a hundred.

111
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:13,540
 We're talking every single animal on the planet, one by one, God brought them to Adam.

112
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:19,140
 Adam goes, "Cat, dog, giraffe.

113
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,140
 No, wait.

114
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,140
 No, no, no, no.

115
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,140
 Horse.

116
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,140
 This one is horse.

117
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,140
 This one is giraffe.

118
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,220
 Like, how long did this take?

119
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,020
 Were there any that he said, "Falcon?

120
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,340
 No, no, no.

121
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,340
 Eagle.

122
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,340
 You're eagle.

123
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,340
 You're falcon."

124
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,980
 I have a crazy imagination.

125
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,220
 But the point is, Adam and God worked together on this.

126
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,140
 And I wonder again, did God really need Adam to do this?

127
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,180
 Had he run out of creative ideas?

128
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,240
 I mean, he's just created the world.

129
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,640
 He created all the animals.

130
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,700
 Did he really need Adam to do this job?

131
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,420
 Of course not.

132
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,420
 But he chose to partner with Adam.

133
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,880
 He chose to partner with man.

134
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:08,060
 Now this partnership, this pattern of partnership or co-working with God continues throughout

135
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,460
 Scripture.

136
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,420
 We see it from cover to cover.

137
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,740
 We see God giving Moses the task of speaking to Pharaoh.

138
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,900
 We see God, through the prophet, instructing the widow to gather empty jars of oil, empty

139
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,060
 oil jars so that he could fill them with oil.

140
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,620
 In the New Testament, we see Jesus giving instruction for empty jugs to be filled with

141
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,620
 water.

142
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,300
 We see Jesus using the little boy's lunch to feed the multitude.

143
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,700
 There are so many more examples contained in this book.

144
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,180
 Now don't get nervous.

145
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,800
 We're not going to go through them all tonight.

146
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,700
 Not going to do that.

147
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,900
 But the pattern is there.

148
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,820
 So what does partnership with God look like when it comes to missions?

149
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,060
 What does that look like?

150
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,820
 We partner through prayer.

151
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,460
 That's one of the primary ways we partner with missions.

152
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:13,180
 Jesus said in Matthew chapter 9, 37 through 38, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers

153
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,900
 are few.

154
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:20,260
 Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into the harvest field."

155
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,520
 A clear call to prayer.

156
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,260
 It doesn't get much clearer than that.

157
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:34,180
 Now let me ask, if the harvest was plentiful in Jesus' day, if the workers were few in

158
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:43,220
 Jesus' day, how much more plentiful is the harvest today in 2022?

159
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,360
 The population of the world is exploding.

160
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,340
 It continues to increase.

161
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:56,260
 Current figures place the population of the world at about 7.8 billion people.

162
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:02,020
 7.8 billion people are on this planet.

163
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,460
 That's a number that's hard for us to comprehend, and the number keeps growing.

164
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,060
 It keeps growing.

165
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,060
 But here's the staggering part of the number.

166
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:20,860
 Two-thirds of the population of the world, approximately 5.2 billion, make no profession

167
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,180
 of faith in Jesus Christ.

168
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:34,060
 Two-thirds of the population of the world make no profession of faith in Christ.

169
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,980
 That's staggering, and that makes me sad, but it also motivates me.

170
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,820
 It drives me to say, "They have to know."

171
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:50,440
 If ever we intend to reach the harvest, we must pray for workers.

172
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:59,160
 We must pray for people to reach two-thirds of the population of the planet.

173
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,480
 We partner in missions through giving.

174
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,900
 We just heard the beautiful testimony of sons and daughters, and we see the very clear need

175
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,820
 for princess and those like her.

176
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,620
 It costs money to go back home.

177
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:17,700
 It costs money to run a drop-in center.

178
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,700
 It's practical, it's not exciting to talk about money, but it's necessary.

179
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,660
 It takes money to pay the lease.

180
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,060
 We have to pay a lease on our own home.

181
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:32,140
 Leases have to be paid for services like this.

182
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,220
 We partner by giving, giving of our finances.

183
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:41,780
 So I encourage you, I echo Pastor James, go see the booth right out here, buy some pretty

184
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,780
 candles.

185
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,780
 Christmas is coming.

186
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,620
 Do your Christmas shopping.

187
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,460
 Christmas shopping and supporting missions, win-win.

188
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,740
 You can be early.

189
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,920
 Go down the hall and see the other exhibits as well.

190
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,420
 Missions takes money, and we've been so, so blessed that we can give and we can partner

191
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,980
 in missions.

192
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:08,540
 But one of the biggest ways that we partner in missions is through going.

193
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,580
 See, giving is easy.

194
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,900
 Praying is easy.

195
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,940
 Going, that's the one where we all kind of, "Eh, I don't know."

196
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,900
 That's the one every missions weekend where you're anticipating, "When are they going

197
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,860
 to read the Great Commission?

198
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,020
 When are they going to talk to me about going overseas?

199
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,440
 Where's the sign-up sheet for the missions trip?"

200
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,660
 Going is hard.

201
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,380
 Going requires a lot.

202
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,780
 Pastor James read our scripture, the Great Commission, and I want to read it to us one

203
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,620
 more time.

204
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:49,180
 When Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.

205
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:55,340
 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and

206
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:02,960
 of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.

207
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,940
 And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age."

208
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:16,300
 There's one word, two-letter word, "go," that triggers so many different reactions in us.

209
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,460
 Many times we've applied the word "go" to missionaries in the traditional sense.

210
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:28,060
 Missionaries, those who leave their home country, move to a foreign land, learn a new language,

211
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:35,000
 immerse themselves in an unfamiliar culture, and preach the gospel to win the lost of Christ.

212
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,300
 For some, that thought is terrifying.

213
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:43,260
 Thoughts start to invade our minds, like, "I could never leave my home country.

214
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,340
 I could never give up the comforts of my home.

215
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,500
 I could never learn a new language.

216
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,820
 I could never learn a new culture."

217
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,340
 And these thoughts paralyze us.

218
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,980
 And we don't even like to pray about going because we're afraid God just might answer

219
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
 that prayer.

220
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,460
 Do we remember what Pastor Steve said last week?

221
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:10,380
 There are certain prayers we don't like to pray because we think God, we fear God just

222
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,020
 may answer that prayer.

223
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,540
 He gave us a simple prayer last week that he prays every day.

224
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,040
 He said, "Lord, bring me someone to serve today.

225
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,780
 Don't raise your hands."

226
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,540
 But did we pray that prayer this week?

227
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,600
 I'm not going to look around, not going to make eye contact.

228
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,300
 But did we pray that?

229
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,180
 I'll let you meditate on that with the Lord.

230
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:40,260
 But in the same manner, many of us don't want to pray about going out of fear that the Lord

231
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,780
 may answer and say, "Yes, I want you to go to a hard place.

232
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:51,740
 Yes, I want you to go to this country, fill in the blank."

233
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,860
 Because if we're honest, we probably all have a country in mind that we think, "Oh God,

234
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,100
 send me anywhere but there."

235
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,580
 And it's different for each of us.

236
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,000
 "Oh God, please don't make me go there."

237
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,800
 So we don't even pray because we don't want God to answer that prayer.

238
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,700
 Or how about this trigger from the word "go"?

239
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,580
 For some of us, we hear that word "go" and we get a sense of relief.

240
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:27,540
 Because for some of us, it is simply impossible to relocate internationally as a traditional

241
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,000
 missionary would.

242
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,980
 And there are legitimate reasons for this.

243
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,020
 There may be health issues that prevent you from moving.

244
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:41,160
 There may be issues with your age or other true legitimate reasons that you could never

245
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,320
 move to a foreign country.

246
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:50,420
 So for those people, sometimes there's a tendency to go, "I don't have to worry about it.

247
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,380
 I'm excused.

248
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,960
 The mandate of 'go' does not apply to me."

249
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,640
 Well, yes it does, but I'm going to explain that.

250
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,600
 You see, while our definitions of "go" and "missionary" have not been incorrect, I would

251
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,940
 suggest that our definitions have been too narrow.

252
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,060
 And I would suggest that it's time to expand our definitions.

253
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,160
 Let's just be practical for a moment.

254
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:25,760
 Every Christian in the city cannot leave and go to another country.

255
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,100
 Cannot.

256
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,980
 We cannot all leave, especially at the same time.

257
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,300
 Imagine if every Christian in the city of Hong Kong said, "Oh, God said go.

258
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
 I'm leaving.

259
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,740
 I'm going to another country, going overseas."

260
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,260
 Fend for yourself.

261
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,420
 Chaos would ensue.

262
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,400
 Darkness would take over.

263
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,080
 Who would witness to the people still here if we all left?

264
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,500
 Everyone cannot go.

265
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,280
 Everyone is not supposed to go in their traditional sense.

266
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,140
 Some will be called to go to foreign lands, and I don't want to diminish that calling

267
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,180
 at all.

268
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,780
 It is true.

269
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:12,500
 Most of us in this room will never live as a traditional missionary in another country,

270
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,560
 but we are called to go.

271
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:24,040
 So we must ask the question, "If I'm not called to go overseas, then what does 'go'

272
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,580
 mean to me?

273
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,640
 How am I to partner with God in the Great Commission?"

274
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:38,560
 We are privileged to live in Hong Kong, and for most of us, our 'go' simply means walk

275
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:45,380
 outside of our front door and see the nations that are right in front of us.

276
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:53,280
 Even after the crazy tumultuous last three years, Hong Kong is still a global city.

277
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,920
 Hong Kong is a place where people come and they go.

278
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,940
 It's a transient city.

279
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,600
 People come for work, they come for study, they come as refugees, they come for many

280
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,080
 different reasons, and for the most part, they come for a purpose, they achieve that

281
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:16,560
 purpose, and then they either return to their homeland or move on to another country.

282
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:23,200
 I spoke with a friend of mine this week who works in the admissions department at HKU,

283
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,220
 and he told me that there are students at HKU from over 90 countries.

284
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:37,360
 Over 90 countries are represented in just one university in our city.

285
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,300
 Let that sink in for just a moment.

286
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:46,200
 These students will be here for one to four years, depending on their program of study,

287
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,160
 then they're either going back home or going on to another country for work.

288
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,320
 You and I are not going to 90 countries.

289
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,020
 It's not going to happen.

290
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,060
 It's not possible.

291
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,080
 We don't have time.

292
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,220
 We don't have the finances.

293
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,880
 We don't have the language skills to go to 90.

294
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,720
 Who speaks 90 languages?

295
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,900
 I've heard of polyglots who speak five and six and seven language, and those people amaze

296
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,900
 me.

297
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
 I'm struggling with two.

298
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:20,460
 I struggle with two, but we don't have the language skills to go to 90 countries.

299
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,660
 Do you know how long it would take us just to learn the languages and to learn the cultures?

300
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:29,500
 So we're not going, but they are.

301
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:38,360
 We can impact 90 nations just by reaching the visiting students at one university in

302
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,900
 our city.

303
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,400
 And that's just one segment of our city.

304
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,560
 There are many, many other countries represented in business, not to mention the over 300,000

305
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,600
 domestic workers employed in Hong Kong.

306
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,840
 For many of us, Go means sharing the gospel with those closest to us, our family, our

307
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,880
 coworkers, our employees, or our employers.

308
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,080
 I have a very good friend who's been living here for over 25 years, and over her time

309
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,240
 here in Hong Kong, she's employed several domestic helpers at different times.

310
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,320
 And each time, she has intentionally hired someone who is not a Christian.

311
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:31,520
 With the express prayer in her heart of, "Oh God, please allow me to witness to my helper.

312
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,540
 Please allow me to share the gospel with my helper."

313
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,300
 Each of her helpers eventually came to know Jesus.

314
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,480
 Each one of them, they went back to their home in the Philippines and won their families

315
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
 to Jesus.

316
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,560
 And one of her helpers became a pastor in her home province in the Philippines.

317
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,480
 Now see, my friend is never going to live in the Philippines.

318
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,880
 That's not where God has called her to go.

319
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,520
 God's called her here.

320
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,800
 But she has answered the yes of the Go of the Great Commission by winning the person

321
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,100
 right in front of her.

322
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,080
 She's been a very effective missionary to the Philippines.

323
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,840
 Let me ask us, have we considered that the people we employ, whether domestic workers,

324
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,280
 people in our office, people in our school, have we considered that they could be part

325
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,200
 of the answer of Go for us?

326
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,160
 That's part of our Go, the people right in front of us.

327
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,680
 See we sometimes disqualify ourselves from going with statements like, "I don't know

328
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,440
 enough to tell anybody about the gospel."

329
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,040
 "I'm not old enough."

330
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,800
 Or the flip side, "I'm too old.

331
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,120
 I can't say anything."

332
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,480
 These are myths that keep us from going.

333
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,200
 Let me help, and the biggest myth is, "I don't know enough."

334
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,740
 Let me help us with that one.

335
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,760
 We will never know enough.

336
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,240
 We will never know enough doctrine.

337
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,080
 We will never know enough theology.

338
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,560
 We will never know the Bible cover to cover.

339
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,640
 We don't have to.

340
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,800
 We just have to know what Jesus has done for us.

341
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,520
 That's all we have to know to share the gospel.

342
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,320
 Psalm 107, "Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story."

343
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,040
 You see a connection is far more powerful when someone hears my story.

344
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,960
 When they hear my story, they hear something they can relate to.

345
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,440
 They're going to click onto that far quicker than they would about doctrinal statements

346
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,000
 or theological statements.

347
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,360
 Sometimes we hesitate to go because we fear being unsuccessful.

348
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,120
 We don't want to fail.

349
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,320
 We live in such a results-driven world that the fear of failure can stop us in our tracks.

350
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:04,160
 But God has a different definition of success and failure.

351
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,440
 I love the way Mother Teresa said it, "God has not called me to be successful.

352
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,120
 He's called me to be faithful."

353
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,920
 God has not called me to be successful.

354
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,800
 He's called me to be faithful.

355
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,360
 We will not find the instruction anywhere in the Bible, "Go be successful."

356
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,800
 It's not in there.

357
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,600
 We've just been told to go.

358
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,080
 And as we read some of the scriptures last week, again, as we've been studying in 1 Corinthians,

359
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,740
 we may be the one who plants.

360
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,200
 We may be the one who waters.

361
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,600
 The results, that's up to God.

362
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:53,280
 My job, your job, our job is to go, to plant or to water.

363
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:01,760
 And as the band gets ready to come on up, I want to close with these words, with these

364
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,320
 last few thoughts.

365
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,980
 God did not create a race of mindless, pre-programmed robots.

366
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:16,060
 He created us and has chose us to partner with him to reach the world with a message

367
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,100
 of salvation.

368
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,580
 In the Great Commission, he gave us a task and told us to go.

369
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,980
 He's now brought the nations of the world to Hong Kong.

370
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:37,140
 1 Timothy 2.4 says, "God wants all people to be saved, to come to a knowledge of the

371
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,140
 truth."

372
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,180
 You see, the nations are here.

373
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:47,700
 So if you reach Hong Kong with the gospel, you reach the world.

374
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,980
 The world is right outside our front door.

375
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,760
 The world is right beside us on the MTR.

376
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,280
 The world is in our office, in our classroom.

377
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:06,840
 Oswald Chambers said this, "We all want to do the will of God, and we know that there's

378
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,840
 nothing nearer to his heart than the evangelization of the world."

379
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:22,020
 And as the band prepares to lead us in a response, may I invite us to ask the Lord, "What does

380
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,880
 go mean to me?"

381
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,000
 What does go mean to me?

382
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,640
 Let's make this our prayer.

383
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:39,540
 Lord, please give me a willing heart to go to my family, to my coworkers, to my employees,

384
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:46,120
 to my employer, to organizations like Sons and Daughters, to lonely refugees and asylum

385
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,720
 seekers, to domestic workers, to university students far from home, to the world that

386
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,000
 you have brought to Hong Kong, and even to a foreign land.

387
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:08,000
