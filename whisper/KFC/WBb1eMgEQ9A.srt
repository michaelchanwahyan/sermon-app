1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 >> Thank you, Johnny.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,260
 Good evening, everybody, and good evening to those watching on YouTube.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,760
 I want to talk tonight about jigsaw puzzles.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:31,840
 The rise of jigsaw puzzle sales during the COVID-19 pandemic is, well, puzzling.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:46,560
 Social media is filled with images of completed, half-completed, or sometimes abandoned puzzles.

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,540
 And we all know the frustration, don't we?

7
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:57,380
 You do a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle, and you're just coming to the end, and that last

8
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,000
 piece is missing.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,600
 You say a few words, which I can't repeat, blaming it on the manufacturer, when in fact,

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,540
 you have lost the piece.

11
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:19,020
 Now we have called this series, "Dear Church."

12
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,680
 I see church as a jigsaw puzzle.

13
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:31,080
 You each have a piece.

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:38,960
 When we put them together, it is a complete picture.

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:49,140
 I want to tell you tonight and those people watching online, we need every piece.

16
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:57,220
 We need you to bring your piece to complete the puzzle.

17
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:03,660
 And we need you not to hold the missing piece.

18
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:11,800
 Actually, this is my first preaching sermon here for five weeks.

19
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,220
 The last time I preached at KFC, we were on Zoom.

20
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,580
 Does that make me a lazy pastor?

21
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,260
 Don't answer that one.

22
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:41,700
 Well, I see our team, Pastor James, Pastor Johnny, Pastor Michelle, and yes, Bonnie as

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:50,300
 well, as a jigsaw.

24
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,140
 But what has this got to do with the book of Revelation?

25
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:03,540
 Well, I also see the seven letters as a jigsaw puzzle.

26
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,100
 We can look at all seven, piece them together.

27
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,340
 And here we have a map, a picture of the seven.

28
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,620
 When we piece them together, Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamon, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia,

29
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:33,380
 and Lydicea, I believe we can also get a picture, a complete picture of what God is saying to

30
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,860
 the church.

31
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:43,780
 And that is the point of this Dear Church series.

32
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:55,500
 What is still saying, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the church.

33
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:05,300
 I'll put it another way, more bluntly, listen or else.

34
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:18,020
 So we told you right at the beginning, those seven churches are now seven piles of rock.

35
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:23,700
 And so today is our halfway mark, lesson number four.

36
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:30,660
 As we read and understand the letter to the church in Thyatira, the fourth piece of the

37
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:39,740
 jigsaw, what we're gonna see is how the picture is starting to come together and what it means

38
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,340
 to us today.

39
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,020
 And God is saying to us today, "Church, watch out."

40
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,620
 Let's read it.

41
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,900
 To the angel of the church in Thyatira writes,

42
00:04:52,900 --> 00:05:00,420
 "These are the words of the Son of God, whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet

43
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,180
 are like burnished bronze.

44
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,340
 I know your deeds, your love and your faith, your service and perseverance, and that you

45
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,500
 are now doing more than you did at first.

46
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,820
 Nevertheless, I have this against you.

47
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,980
 You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet.

48
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:31,460
 By her teaching, she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food

49
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,140
 sacrificed to idols.

50
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:41,140
 I have given her a time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.

51
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,980
 And so I will cast her into a bed of suffering.

52
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:52,820
 And I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely, unless they repent

53
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,260
 of their ways.

54
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,260
 I will strike her children dead.

55
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:06,420
 Then all the churches will know that I am He who searches hearts and minds, and I will

56
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,020
 repay each one of you according to your deeds.

57
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,460
 Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, to those who do not hold to her teaching and

58
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:27,020
 have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets, I will not impose any other burden on you

59
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:36,260
 except to hold on to what you have until I come.

60
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:42,380
 To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give authority over the

61
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:50,500
 nations that one will rule them with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like

62
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:57,300
 pottery just as I have received authority from my Father.

63
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:05,500
 I will also give that one the morning star.

64
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:15,220
 And he finishes in the usual way, whoever as hears, let them hear what the Spirit says

65
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,620
 to the churches.

66
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:26,780
 Now the first thing we notice is that the longest message was sent to the church in

67
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,380
 the smallest city.

68
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:38,380
 Thyatira was a wealthy town on the Lycus River in the Roman province of Asia.

69
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,380
 It's what we call modern day Turkey.

70
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:50,220
 Thyatira was on the borders of Lydia and Mycenae and was the original home of Lydia, the Dyer

71
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,780
 of the Purple Cloth.

72
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:03,220
 It was about 40 miles east-southeast of Pergamon and a similar distance northeast of Smyrna.

73
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:10,220
 And the church may well have been started by Lydia herself.

74
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:17,900
 Thyatira was a military town as well as a commercial center with many trade guilds.

75
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,060
 Many trade guilds, that is the key.

76
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:34,460
 Wherever guilds were found, idolatry and immorality, the two great enemies of the early church

77
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:40,980
 were always or almost always present too.

78
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:48,100
 Pastor Michelle shared this when she spoke about Pergamon.

79
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:56,380
 In 1817, similar to the pagan gods of Pergamon, remember, the city here boasted a special

80
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,700
 temple.

81
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:05,060
 This time to Apollo, the sun god.

82
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,820
 Now Apollo has been recognized, you'll see him on the screen.

83
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:17,060
 As a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the sun

84
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,340
 and light and poetry and more.

85
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:24,340
 He is one of the most important and complex of the Greek gods.

86
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:31,940
 He is the son of Zeus, the twin brother of Artemis, goddess of the hunt.

87
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:39,860
 As you can see from the picture, he was seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of

88
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,940
 a beardless athletic youth.

89
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:54,300
 Apollo is considered to be the most Greek of all gods.

90
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:05,660
 And this might explain why the Lord himself, Jesus introduced himself as the son of God.

91
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:14,480
 This is the only time in the book of Revelation that this title, the son of God is used.

92
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,180
 We read right at the beginning.

93
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:24,060
 These are the words of the son of God.

94
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:32,540
 The apostle John had to deliver a message of severe warning and judgment to this congregation,

95
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:40,760
 which explains the description of the Lord's eyes and feet.

96
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,840
 We read this.

97
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:53,420
 These are the words of the son of God whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet

98
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,260
 are like burnished bronze.

99
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,780
 Let me explain this.

100
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,620
 Firstly, eyes like a blazing fire.

101
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,100
 Other translations say a flame of fire.

102
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:14,820
 Fire in the Bible is a symbol of holiness as God is holy.

103
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:22,180
 But it also symbolizes God's anger against sin.

104
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:30,360
 Fire is penetrating and piercing and it consumes everything in its path.

105
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,320
 And if you're in it, you can't hide from it.

106
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,100
 What does this mean to us?

107
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:45,480
 It means that no one can hide from the Lord and nothing is hidden from him.

108
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:53,080
 He sees all and his wrath is like a fire.

109
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,480
 We then read his feet are like burnished bronze.

110
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,880
 Other versions, fine brass.

111
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,600
 Bronze or brass in the Bible represents judgment.

112
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,640
 You see I put scales up here.

113
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,180
 Judgment for disobeying God.

114
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,400
 And what this means is because God is all seeing and all knowing, he will eventually

115
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:25,240
 judge everyone according to their deeds.

116
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:37,800
 From this uncompromising introduction, we move on to the main body of the letter.

117
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,260
 Can I be honest Pastor James, one of my favourite points of the whole series was when you introduced

118
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,200
 the poo sandwich.

119
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,580
 The nature of these letters.

120
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:55,320
 And James was talking about the success and the errors, at least five of the churches

121
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,500
 and his suggestions.

122
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,880
 Jesus through the apostle John follows this approach.

123
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,660
 But for today at East, I want to call it the three A's approach.

124
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,940
 Approval, accusation and assurance.

125
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,860
 It sounds better than a poo sandwich, doesn't it?

126
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,100
 So let's start on the first one, approval.

127
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
 Verse 19.

128
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
 Look at this.

129
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,620
 "I know your deeds, your love and your faith, your service and perseverance, and that you

130
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,780
 are now doing more than you did at first."

131
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,580
 So far, so good.

132
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,700
 The believers in Thyatira were a busy lot.

133
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,260
 They were involved in sacrificial ministry for the sake of others.

134
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:59,140
 What's more, their works were increasing and they were characterised by faith and love

135
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,540
 and patience.

136
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:08,460
 So this church was not guilty of mere religious activity.

137
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:15,180
 It looks like the description of a perfect church.

138
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,500
 But a perfect church doesn't exist.

139
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:25,660
 If you think you find a perfect church, don't you join it because you'll spoil it.

140
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,820
 There is no such thing as a perfect church.

141
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,340
 And so we come to the accusation.

142
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:42,420
 The Lord, alas, found much to expose and condemn in the assembly.

143
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,460
 Nevertheless, I have this against you.

144
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:54,460
 You tolerate that woman Jezebel who calls herself a prophet.

145
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:01,780
 By her teaching, she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food

146
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,860
 sacrificed to idols.

147
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,420
 I've given her a time to repent of her immorality, but she is unwilling.

148
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,940
 So I will cast her on a bed of suffering.

149
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,700
 I will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely unless they repent of

150
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,260
 their ways.

151
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,820
 I will strike her children dead.

152
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:30,460
 Then all the churches will know that I am He who searches hearts and minds.

153
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:40,060
 And I will repay each of you according to your deeds.

154
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,700
 Ouch.

155
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:51,060
 What is being said here is that no amount of loving and sacrificial work can compensate

156
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,900
 for tolerance of evil.

157
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,660
 Now I want to just stop there for a moment.

158
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,580
 Tolerance can be a very good thing.

159
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:10,340
 When Sandra and I were in United Amorites last year, we met a sheikh who was, I think

160
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,380
 he was one of the top three sheikhs, he was very, very, very wealthy.

161
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,380
 And he was the minister of tolerance.

162
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,620
 He was actually called the minister of tolerance.

163
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:27,940
 And because of the minister of tolerance in supposedly a Muslim country, it meant that

164
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:37,500
 Christianity as well as other religions were actually positively tolerated and embraced.

165
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,280
 We're not talking about that.

166
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:46,300
 We're talking here about tolerance of evil.

167
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:53,700
 And we read the church was permitting a false prophetess to influence the people and lead

168
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,860
 them into compromise.

169
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:03,500
 Now it's not likely that this woman was actually called Jezebel.

170
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,940
 Since such an infamous name would not be given to a child.

171
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:13,260
 It's like you calling your son Hitler, right?

172
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,060
 But the name is symbolic.

173
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:28,340
 Jezebel was the idolatrous queen who enticed Israel to add Baal worship to their religious

174
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
 ceremonies.

175
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:36,140
 We want to read about her 1 Kings 16-19.

176
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:44,620
 The seductive teaching of Jezebel was similar to the doctrine of Balaam.

177
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:50,940
 But Pastor Michelle told us that the Lord condemned in the church of Pergamon.

178
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,860
 Revelation 2-14.

179
00:17:54,860 --> 00:18:02,300
 She taught believers to compromise with the Roman religion and the practices of their

180
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:10,540
 guilds so that Christians would not lose their jobs or their lives.

181
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:23,740
 Now it's interesting to contrast the churches of Ephesus and Thyatira.

182
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:30,220
 Remember Pastor James told us the Ephesus church, Ephesian church was weakening in its

183
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:38,220
 love and yet faithful to judge false teachers.

184
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:49,260
 While the people in Thyatira were growing in their love but too tolerant of false doctrine.

185
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,980
 Both extremes must be avoided in the church.

186
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:07,280
 The verse I love is Ephesians 4-15 when Paul says, "Speaking the truth in love."

187
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,460
 That is the biblical balance.

188
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:24,100
 Unloving orthodoxy and loving compromise are both hateful to God.

189
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,500
 But look at this.

190
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:34,780
 I have given her time to repent of her immorality but she is unwilling.

191
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:41,580
 So not only was the church at Thyatira tolerant of evil, but it was proud and unwilling to

192
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,920
 repent.

193
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:53,060
 The Lord gave the prophetess time to repent yet she refused.

194
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:59,260
 Now he was giving her followers opportunity to repent.

195
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:08,380
 His eyes of fire had searched out their thoughts and motives and he would make no mistake.

196
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:17,600
 In fact, the Lord threatened to use this assembly as a solemn example to all churches not to

197
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,300
 tolerate evil.

198
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:34,500
 He said, "Then all the churches will know that I am He who searches hearts and minds."

199
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,180
 The previous verse is actually quite frightening.

200
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,080
 So I will cast her on a bed of suffering and I will make those who commit adultery with

201
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,960
 her suffer intensely unless they repent of their ways.

202
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:54,940
 I will strike her children dead.

203
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:02,300
 Jezebel and her children, her followers would be sentenced to tribulation and death.

204
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:12,260
 Idolatry and compromise are in the Bible pictured as fornication and unfaithfulness to the marriage

205
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,780
 vows.

206
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:22,660
 Jezebel's bed of sin would become a bed of sickness.

207
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,460
 Now to kill with death means to kill with pestilence.

208
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:35,620
 God would judge the false prophetess and her followers once and for all.

209
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:44,460
 One of the things that we're learning week after week is yes, God is a God of love, but

210
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,700
 we should never take Him for granted.

211
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,080
 He is a God of judgment.

212
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,540
 We cannot just get on with living our lives, dabbling with sin.

213
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,980
 Remember Michelle told us being pulled this way by the world and this way by the way of

214
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,820
 God.

215
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:12,900
 Don't look at these verses and say, "That's not me."

216
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:22,860
 God says to us, "The church of the 21st century, don't be naive."

217
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,940
 Then we come to the assurance.

218
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:34,060
 Not everyone in the assembly was unfaithful to the Lord and He had a special word for

219
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
 them.

220
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:41,020
 "Now I say to the rest of you," in Thyatira, "to you who do not hold onto her teaching

221
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:48,500
 and have not learned Satan's so-called deep secrets, I will impose no other burden on

222
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,420
 you except to hold onto what you have until I come.

223
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,740
 To the one who is victorious and does my will to the end, I will give them authority over

224
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,980
 the nations.

225
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,100
 That one will rule with an iron scepter and will dash them to pieces like pottery, just

226
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,740
 as I have received authority from my Father.

227
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,260
 I will also give that one the morning star.

228
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:19,060
 Whoever has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."

229
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:26,580
 This group of people had separated themselves from the false doctrine and the compromising

230
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:36,180
 practices of Jezebel and her followers, which Christ denounces as the deaths of Satan.

231
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:44,020
 Interestingly here, the Lord has no special demands to make.

232
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:49,620
 He simply wanted them to hold fast in their resistance to evil.

233
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:58,260
 "I will not impose any burden on you," He said, "except to hold on to what you have

234
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:02,260
 until I come."

235
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:09,380
 Now "until I come" refers to Christ's return for His people, at which time He will reward

236
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,700
 them, He will reward us for our faithfulness.

237
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:23,860
 This is the first mention in the book of Revelation of the Lord's coming for the church.

238
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:32,540
 In contrast, the reference in Revelation 1-7 was to Christ's return on earth in judgment,

239
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:37,260
 to defeat His enemies and establish His kingdom.

240
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:44,740
 But here the believers in Thyatira are promised authority over the nations, which probably

241
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:53,340
 refers to the fact that God's people will live and reign with Christ.

242
00:24:53,340 --> 00:25:06,740
 When God sets up His kingdom on earth, it will be a righteous kingdom with perfect justice

243
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,300
 and no virus.

244
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,660
 He will rule with a rod of iron.

245
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:20,180
 Rebellious men will be like clay pots, easily broken to pieces.

246
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:29,340
 And then Jesus said, "I will also give that one the morning star."

247
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:38,660
 We read later in the book of Revelation that Jesus Christ is the bright and morning star.

248
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:47,540
 Interesting this one, the promise in Revelation 2-28 suggests that God's people shall be so

249
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:54,780
 closely identified with Christ that He will belong to them.

250
00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:02,420
 But perhaps there is also an allusion here to Satan, who remember wanted the kingdom

251
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:08,660
 for himself and who offered in Matthew 4, the world's kingdoms to Christ, if he would

252
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,580
 worship Him but once.

253
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:19,300
 In Isaiah 14, Satan is named Lucifer.

254
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,500
 You know what that means in Hebrew?

255
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:32,340
 Lucifer means brightness, bright star.

256
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:39,220
 The compromising people in Thyatira were following the deaths of Satan, which would lead to darkness

257
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,620
 and death.

258
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:52,020
 God's overcomers on the other hand would share the morning star.

259
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,120
 Can I be honest with you?

260
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:06,820
 As I look at the 21st century church, as I look at KFCI, I hear God say to us, "I want

261
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:14,700
 you to be overcomers, not compromisers.

262
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:22,340
 I want you to be overcomers, not compromisers."

263
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:32,380
 As I prayed this week, I sense God gave me the word superficiality.

264
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:40,140
 So much of today's church is superficial.

265
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,300
 Can we not be a superficial church?

266
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:52,940
 But what is God through these letters saying to us today, to today's church, as we arrive

267
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:59,300
 at halftime and review these first four messages to the church?

268
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:05,900
 We can see the dangers that still exist for the people of God.

269
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:14,180
 Like Ephesus, we can be zealous and orthodox, but at the same time, lose our devotion to

270
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,540
 Christ.

271
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:24,300
 Or like Thyatira, our love can be increasing, yet lacking in the kind of discernment that

272
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,380
 is necessary to keep the church pure.

273
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:38,780
 Like Pergamum and Thyatira, we may be so tolerant of evil that we grieve the Lord and invite

274
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,780
 His judgment.

275
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:47,060
 Let me ask you a question at the beginning.

276
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:53,260
 Would we have selected Smyrna that Pastor Johnny talked about?

277
00:28:53,260 --> 00:29:01,020
 Would we have selected Smyrna as the most spiritual church of the four?

278
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,820
 Because on the surface, they definitely weren't.

279
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:13,300
 We probably wouldn't have selected Smyrna, but the Lord did.

280
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:24,420
 We need to remind ourselves not to judge God's people by wrong standards because only the

281
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,340
 Lord can see the heart.

282
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:38,140
 God's exhortation to these churches, except Smyrna, is this.

283
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,660
 Repent.

284
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,020
 Change your minds.

285
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:57,700
 It is not only lost sinners who need to repent, but disobedient Christians.

286
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:04,060
 If we do not repent and deal with sin in our lives and in our assemblies, the Lord may

287
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:09,740
 judge us and remove our lampstand.

288
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:24,260
 How tragic is it when a local church gradually abandons its faith and loses its witness for

289
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,780
 Christ.

290
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,860
 Hear, but have an ear.

291
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,940
 Let him hear what the Spirit says unto the churches.

292
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:41,740
 Come out of the worship band, please.

293
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:55,620
 I'm going to invite you all to stand.

294
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:05,420
 I believe this is a time for us to surrender.

295
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:14,220
 We're actually going to sing that song that we sing so often, "I Surrender."

296
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,100
 Here I am down on my knees again.

297
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:23,220
 I'm not inviting you necessarily to get physically on your knees, but spiritually.

298
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,220
 I want to challenge you.

299
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:31,580
 I want to challenge everybody who is listening online.

300
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:39,100
 The word tonight is surrender.

301
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:45,540
 If you're here tonight, if you're listening online and you're not following Jesus, that

302
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:53,980
 Jesus Christ is not your Lord and Saviour, I want to invite you right where you are.

303
00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:03,140
 Right now to say in your heart, "Jesus, I've sinned.

304
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,220
 I want to come to your cross, repent of my sins.

305
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:12,900
 I want to follow you, Jesus."

306
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:20,540
 And if you're willing to do that, please tell someone.

307
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:27,420
 But for those of us who are Christians, we can't just tick the box that we've said the

308
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:31,780
 sinner's prayer.

309
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:39,500
 We can't just tick the box that we come to church, that we do this, that, and that.

310
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:46,060
 God is saying to us now, to the church in KSC, to the church in Hong Kong, to the church

311
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:54,940
 of 2020, will you surrender?

312
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:01,300
 Will you repent and turn from your ways?

313
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:09,060
 You have tolerated evil.

314
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,900
 Would you get on your knees and say, "Sorry."

315
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:18,980
 Because you know the Lord is more than ready to forgive.

316
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:25,460
 He's more ready to forgive than we are even to say, "Sorry."

317
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:32,660
 So during this song, either on your knees with your hands or in your heart, it doesn't

318
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,660
 matter.

319
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,660
 It's not religion.

320
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:41,700
 I invite you to say, "Jesus, you are the Son of God.

321
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
 I believe this.

322
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:50,140
 Jesus, I know that I have done, I have said, I have thought things which are not of you.

323
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,580
 Lord, I have tolerated things which I know are not of you.

324
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,620
 I have made friends with the world.

325
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,620
 I surrender.

326
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:08,540
 All I am is yours.

327
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,380
 Take me, Lord.

328
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,620
 Take me and use me.

329
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:20,940
 And Lord, would you take this church and use us for your glory in this time and in this

330
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,940
 city.

331
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,500
 In Jesus' name, amen.

332
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
 [Music]
