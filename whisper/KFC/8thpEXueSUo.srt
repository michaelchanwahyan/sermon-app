00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 >>

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 Good evening, everybody.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,440
 Have you ever been to one of these events

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,380
 where the organiser

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,480
 feels you need an icebreaker

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,520
 in order to

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,320
 get the atmosphere

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,660
 and you get told to find

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,420
 somebody

10
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,420
 you don't know?

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,820
 And you then tell them

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,660
 three things about yourself.

13
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,200
 Two things are true and one is false.

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,740
 And you have to guess which one is false.

15
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,100
 And in the process,

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,640
 your new friend

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,240
 has got to know you a little better.

18
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,340
 Now, my favourite icebreaker is this one.

19
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,540
 If they were to make a film

20
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,080
 about you and your life,

21
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,980
 who would you choose?

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,880
 Who do you think I could choose?

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,800
 Any suggestions?

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,460
 If they were making a film about my life,

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,460
 you weren't listening,

26
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,360
 and I had to choose anyone to play me,

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,700
 who would I play me?

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,840
 Who?

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,800
 Andy Lyle.

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,340
 That's interesting.

31
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,680
 I must look very local.

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,180
 That's good.

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,080
 Anybody else?

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
 Any other guesses?

35
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,180
 Sir Patrick Stewart.

36
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,320
 Okay, that's interesting.

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,460
 He's about 90, isn't he?

38
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,260
 I don't know.

39
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:26,960
 Anybody else?

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,020
 Any other guesses?

41
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,020
 Bobby Charlton.

42
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,920
 Oh, my goodness.

43
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,720
 Well, okay.

44
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,760
 All right.

45
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:41,560
 Look, I've resisted George Clooney.

46
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,780
 And resisted Colin Firth.

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,780
 And I take into account

48
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,620
 my slightly crazy personality.

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,880
 I've chosen Jim Carrey.

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,120
 An outrageous extrovert,

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,180
 if ever I saw one.

52
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,860
 Some love him, some hate him,

53
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,120
 but there's no denying

54
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,060
 that Jim Carrey is funny.

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,400
 I mean, what's your favorite Jim Carrey film?

56
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,000
 Any suggestions?

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,540
 Maybe "Dumb and Dumber."

58
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,900
 Maybe "The Mask."

59
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,340
 Maybe "The Cable Guy."

60
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,380
 Oh, yes, and "The Truman Show."

61
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,040
 But my favorite,

62
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,440
 thanks for the spoiler alert,

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,020
 is "Liar, Liar," made in 1997.

64
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,600
 Jim Carrey is cast as Fletcher Reed,

65
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,600
 a fast-talking attorney

66
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,960
 and an habitual liar.

67
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,440
 When his son, Max,

68
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,080
 blows out his candles

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,920
 on his fifth birthday cake,

70
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,860
 he has just one wish,

71
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,900
 that his dad would stop lying

72
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,260
 for 24 hours.

73
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,060
 When Max's wish miraculously comes true,

74
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,180
 Fletcher discovers

75
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,240
 that his biggest asset,

76
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,800
 his mouth,

77
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,220
 has suddenly become

78
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,620
 his biggest liability.

79
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,980
 My favorite scene in the film

80
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,480
 is where Miss Berry, his teacher,

81
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,480
 asks the question of the kids.

82
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,920
 "Today, we're going to talk about

83
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,760
 what our parents do for work."

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,560
 And the little girl says,

85
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,900
 "My mummy is a doctor."

86
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,360
 And little boy says,

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
 "My daddy is a truck driver."

88
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,240
 And Max says,

89
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,440
 "Well, my mum is a teacher."

90
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,480
 So Miss Berry says,

91
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,280
 "And your dad?"

92
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,980
 And Max says this, I kid you not,

93
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,680
 "My dad, he's a liar."

94
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,720
 Teacher says, "A liar?

95
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,920
 I'm sure you don't mean that."

96
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,320
 And Max says, and you'll love this,

97
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,560
 "And he," this is for you, Vincent,

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
 "Well, he wears a suit

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,060
 and he goes to court

100
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,260
 and he talks to the judge."

101
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,260
 And Miss Berry says,

102
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,940
 "Oh, I see.

103
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,980
 You mean he's a lawyer."

104
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,240
 And Max shrugs his shoulders

105
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,880
 and says, "Yeah, whatever."

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,720
 Now, what has that got to do with our series?

107
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,580
 Well, as we discussed last week,

108
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:32,620
 our enemy is a habitual liar.

109
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,820
 He cannot tell the truth for a second,

110
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,320
 let alone 24 hours.

111
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,900
 When we did our Women in the Old Testament series

112
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,300
 and when we looked at the story of Rahab,

113
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,340
 it was about the tendency to downplay lying

114
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,380
 by calling it a fib, a white lie,

115
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,420
 a half-truth, a little lie.

116
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,320
 But I said at the time, and I say it now,

117
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,260
 a lie is a lie.

118
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,200
 Now, Scripture has many names for the enemy.

119
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,240
 One is the father of lies.

120
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,600
 In John 8, 44, I'm gonna read it to you.

121
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,100
 "When he lies, he speaks out of his own character,

122
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,140
 for he is a liar and the father of lies."

123
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,120
 Satan or the devil is known

124
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,420
 by a number of names in Scripture.

125
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:39,460
 And all of these names point to his evil character.

126
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,160
 The chief characteristics we find in this creature

127
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,560
 are hostility, cunning, power,

128
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,600
 and evil intent towards God and towards his people.

129
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,600
 It is therefore strategic for us

130
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,520
 to be able to spot the enemy's lies.

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,920
 Not so you can focus on the lies,

132
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,820
 but so you can avoid them

133
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,960
 and to fix your gaze back to the good shepherd.

134
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,760
 I want you to look at this hand.

135
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,080
 I'll put one on the screen.

136
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,600
 And I'm gonna use these five fingers

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,660
 to help you spot them,

138
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,940
 to help you overcome them,

139
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,840
 and to help you win the battle for your mind

140
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,500
 with the truth of Jesus.

141
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,240
 And the first lie I'm gonna talk about

142
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,420
 is the lie of comparison,

143
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,820
 the lie of comparison.

144
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,820
 Now, first and foremost,

145
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,200
 if you're hearing that it's better at another table,

146
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,960
 you've allowed the enemy a seat at your table.

147
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,800
 John 10:10 says this,

148
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,280
 "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.

149
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:13,300
 I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."

150
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:20,640
 The table that God prepares for you is about life

151
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,880
 and is about abundant life at that.

152
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,880
 Any other table than God's table

153
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,020
 is about stealing, killing, and destroying.

154
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:47,820
 When the enemy sits at your table,

155
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,160
 he often points to another table

156
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,860
 and talks about it being better elsewhere.

157
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:00,080
 How amazing is it somewhere else?

158
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,280
 He points to another table and says,

159
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,740
 "Hey, that is the solution to your problem."

160
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,960
 But ultimately, he is not selling you the truth.

161
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,460
 He's selling you lies.

162
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,120
 He's selling you death.

163
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,500
 And the tool he uses is the tool of trickery,

164
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,940
 the lie of comparison.

165
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,440
 He tells you there's a better table elsewhere.

166
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,520
 It goes something like this.

167
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,080
 Surely you should leave your spouse

168
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,060
 and hook up with somebody else.

169
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,020
 Life would be better there, right?

170
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,760
 That's the solution to all your problems.

171
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,300
 If you could just be with someone else.

172
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,240
 Surely you should run with a other crowd

173
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,080
 who are far more exciting than the people from church.

174
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,920
 Go do your own thing for a season.

175
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,800
 That's gonna be what you want.

176
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,300
 Surely at another table, there's more fun,

177
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,500
 more of what you are looking for.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 My friends, don't, don't, don't give into that.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,740
 The devil loves for you to look at your life

180
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,740
 and compare it with somebody else's.

181
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,120
 And make you wish that you had what they had.

182
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,600
 The whole advertising industry is built around that.

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And Satan has his cocktail shaker ready.

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,180
 And he mixes a little jealousy with a dash of coveting

185
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,780
 and a splash of, "Woe is me."

186
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,780
 And as he's shaking the cocktail,

187
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,460
 he's muttering how God must love that other person

188
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,160
 more than he loves you.

189
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,460
 How God is blessing that person

190
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,660
 more than God is blessing you.

191
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,720
 How God is withholding from you something you need.

192
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:33,260
 Pretty soon this barman has convinced you

193
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,460
 that God isn't good.

194
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,760
 God hasn't blessed you.

195
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,580
 God doesn't love you.

196
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,540
 You missed out on something

197
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,980
 because God is mean and forgot about you.

198
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,340
 Or maybe God's been lying to you all this time.

199
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:02,080
 We have a name for this.

200
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,160
 We call it the grass is always greener syndrome.

201
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:14,220
 If your eyes are not locked on those of the good shepherd,

202
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,100
 then you're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

203
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

204
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

205
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

206
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

207
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

208
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

209
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

210
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

211
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

212
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

213
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

214
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

215
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

216
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

217
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

218
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:35,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

219
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

220
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

221
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

222
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

223
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

224
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

225
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

226
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

227
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

228
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

229
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

230
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

231
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

232
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

233
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

234
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

235
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

236
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

237
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

238
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

239
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

240
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

241
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

242
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

243
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

244
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,100
 You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.

245
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,100
 Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.

246
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:19,100
 My next finger represents the lie that you are doomed.

247
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,100
 If you've somehow bought the lie that somehow you're not going to make it,

248
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,100
 the enemy is at your table.

249
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,100
 The voice tells you that life is hopeless.

250
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
 There's no way out.

251
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
 Might as well chuck it in.

252
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,100
 Quit and die.

253
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,100
 Ever felt like that?

254
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,100
 Where do you get this kind of thinking?

255
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,100
 Where do you hear these words of gloom and doom?

256
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,100
 I can tell you it is not the good shepherd.

257
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,100
 It is more likely the enemy at your table.

258
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,100
 Now last week I spoke about Psalm 23 verse 4.

259
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,100
 I'll read it again.

260
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,100
 "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

261
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:15,100
 I will fear no evil, for you are with me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

262
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:23,100
 The key word in this verse is the one I've put in yellow, through.

263
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,100
 The good shepherd doesn't say you're going to the valley,

264
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,100
 like we're going to happy valley, right?

265
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,100
 You're not going to the valley.

266
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,100
 You are going through it.

267
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:42,100
 In other words, you are going to make it.

268
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:46,100
 He says this, we are going through the valley

269
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,100
 and I'm going to be with you all the way through.

270
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
 And guess what?

271
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,100
 We're going to have a story to tell on the other side.

272
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,100
 Now I said in week one, I owned up.

273
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,100
 If I had written Psalm 23 and not David,

274
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:12,100
 I would have said, you prepare a table for me in your presence

275
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
 and scatter my enemies.

276
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,100
 Sounds much better, right?

277
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,100
 Christians often talk about the loving presence of God.

278
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
 We pray prayers, don't we? We've all done it.

279
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,100
 Lord, we pray that you would be with us today.

280
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
 You've ever prayed that one?

281
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,100
 But you know what? God has already answered that prayer.

282
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,100
 Christ lives in you.

283
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,100
 We may not always feel it.

284
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
 And there are other times we're very aware of his presence,

285
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,100
 like in our worship times.

286
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,100
 But I need to tell you, there is not one Bible verse

287
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
 in the whole of the New Testament

288
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,100
 that encourages us to seek or encourage the presence of God.

289
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
 Why?

290
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,100
 Because God became visible in Jesus

291
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,100
 and now lives in us by his Holy Spirit.

292
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,100
 Can I say that again?

293
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,100
 God became visible in Jesus

294
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:22,100
 and now lives in us by his Holy Spirit.

295
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,100
 I no longer seek the presence of Jesus.

296
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
 I seek the person of Jesus.

297
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,100
 I no longer seek the presence of the Spirit.

298
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,100
 I seek the person of the Holy Spirit and his power.

299
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:45,100
 I have God living in me.

300
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,100
 And God promises he is there with us

301
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,100
 in the presence of our enemies.

302
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,100
 Jesus is at the table with us in the fire,

303
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,100
 as we just sang about,

304
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:02,100
 in hardship, in feelings of hopelessness,

305
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,100
 in the broken world.

306
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,100
 God doesn't eliminate all our difficulties.

307
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,100
 He allows us to walk through hardships

308
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:19,100
 and he walks through those hardships with us.

309
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:26,100
 Have you ever believed that you're hopeless?

310
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,100
 You are not hopeless.

311
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
 I tell you why.

312
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,100
 Jesus lives in you.

313
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:40,100
 Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.

314
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,100
 My next finger represents the lie of worthlessness.

315
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,100
 I've got to be very careful now.

316
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,100
 My number three finger, right?

317
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,100
 Represents the lie of worthlessness.

318
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,100
 If you're hearing voices that say,

319
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,100
 "You're not good enough."

320
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,100
 Again, we briefly touched on this in week one,

321
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100
 when we sang Lauren Daigle's song, "You Say."

322
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
 If you're hearing these voices,

323
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,100
 the enemy is at your table.

324
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,100
 Now we've got to be a little bit careful with this one

325
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:23,100
 because Scripture, after all, calls us to be humble.

326
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,100
 But as C.S. Lewis once said,

327
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,100
 "Humility is not thinking less of yourself,

328
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,100
 but thinking of yourself less."

329
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:40,100
 Humility is not thinking less about yourself,

330
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,100
 but about thinking about yourself less.

331
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:51,100
 In churches, we get confused, often get confused,

332
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:56,100
 by thinking that we are honoring God

333
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,100
 by thinking of ourselves less.

334
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,100
 Nothing could be further from the truth.

335
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,100
 We were made in God's image.

336
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,100
 You were made in God's image.

337
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,100
 Now, this doesn't give us an excuse

338
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:25,100
 to strut around and adopt a "it's all about me" attitude.

339
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
 But it doesn't leave us wallowing in,

340
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:33,100
 "I don't measure up afterwards."

341
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
 By the way, I've been in churches for many, many years.

342
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
 I got very, very used to babies crying in the service.

343
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
 So it's a very lovely thing to happen.

344
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,100
 So don't worry about it.

345
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,100
 The devil is equally pleased

346
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:54,100
 when we think too much or too little of ourselves.

347
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,100
 And tonight, I specifically want to encourage you

348
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,100
 if you gravitate towards the latter camp.

349
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,100
 You just don't feel you are enough.

350
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:11,100
 Maybe someone told you, you'll never amount to anything.

351
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,100
 Here's something, the "Not Enough" anthem

352
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,100
 was composed in the pit of hell.

353
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:25,100
 It's crippling, debilitating, paralyzing, suffocating.

354
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,100
 It did not come from the Good Shepherd.

355
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,100
 If you're hearing it and you're even repeating it,

356
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,100
 there must be an enemy at your table.

357
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,100
 This lie is not a reflection of humility.

358
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,100
 It's a club that beats you over the head.

359
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,100
 It tries to convince you that you are a spiritual reject.

360
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,100
 You're a worthless sinner who will always be a worthless sinner.

361
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,100
 You are not God's child.

362
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:06,100
 Can I suggest you look across the table for a moment?

363
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:14,100
 You lock eyes with the one who is sitting across from you.

364
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,100
 Do you see scorn and shame?

365
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:25,100
 Or do you notice the nail scars on the one who is refilling your water glass

366
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:30,100
 and the pitcher that is being lifted to give you a refreshing drink?

367
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:37,100
 Now, sure I know that's Jesus and he's the Holy One.

368
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:44,100
 But he invited you here.

369
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,100
 He booked the table.

370
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,100
 He prepared the meal.

371
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,100
 He sat down to join you.

372
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:06,100
 And this reservation cost him everything.

373
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,100
 John 10, 11 says, "I am the Good Shepherd."

374
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:14,100
 The Good Shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

375
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:22,100
 Jesus has put it all on the line to be sitting at the table with you.

376
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:28,100
 Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.

377
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:38,100
 My next finger represents the lie of me against the world.

378
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,100
 I had lunch with somebody last week.

379
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,100
 He told me he just quit his job.

380
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:52,100
 When I asked why, he said, "Oh, everybody hated me there."

381
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,100
 As I probed a little wearing my pastor hat,

382
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,100
 I discovered this was not the first time this had happened.

383
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,100
 A couple of years ago, he quit what seemed to be a good job

384
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,100
 because everybody there seemed to be against me.

385
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:15,100
 Sadly, I also discovered he had broken up with the girl he was planning to marry.

386
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
 Again, I asked what happened.

387
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,100
 They seemed so well matched.

388
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
 He said, "I blame her parents.

389
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,100
 They never liked me from the start.

390
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,100
 Everyone in the family hated me."

391
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,100
 I thought to myself, "Really?"

392
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,100
 When you are convinced that everyone is against you,

393
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,100
 you become convinced that everyone hates you.

394
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:47,100
 Your family, everyone at church, your colleagues, your friends, your neighbours.

395
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:55,100
 You're probably sitting there, sure that the waiter has spit in your soup.

396
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:00,100
 If you're hearing a voice that says, "Everyone's against you."

397
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:04,100
 The enemy is sitting at your table.

398
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,100
 He says, "You don't trust anyone."

399
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,100
 You become paranoid and it is not logical.

400
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:18,100
 You may not exactly hear the word hate, but you may be thinking,

401
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,100
 "Ah, that person doesn't even look up at me when I walk in the office.

402
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,100
 I bet she doesn't like me.

403
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,100
 See those people talking over there.

404
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,100
 I guarantee they're talking about me.

405
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,100
 All my friends, they do things without me.

406
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,100
 Nobody ever invites me anywhere.

407
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,100
 Nobody likes me."

408
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:53,100
 What you're doing is you develop a defence mechanism

409
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,100
 and you never allow people to get too close to you.

410
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:07,100
 The simple truth is that you need to let the Good Shepherd lead you by the still waters.

411
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:13,100
 You need Him to let you, cause you to lie down in green pastures.

412
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,100
 You need to ask God to refresh your souls

413
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:23,100
 and guide you along the righteous path of healing and restoration.

414
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:31,100
 You may feel surrounded by pressure and trouble,

415
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:37,100
 but know that God has set a table for you.

416
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:45,100
 And in the middle of all this, God has got your back.

417
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:51,100
 As a minister, I'm always confronted by people trying to trip me up.

418
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,100
 I used to call it the Monday morning email.

419
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,100
 But Sandra and I are blessed to have people all over the world

420
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:06,100
 who have our back and pray for us.

421
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,100
 Now on a Saturday evening, inevitably here at KSC,

422
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,100
 I, Chin and Sway are sitting behind us.

423
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,100
 Now, they're not high profile members of this congregation,

424
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:26,100
 but they are here principally because they've got our back.

425
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:32,100
 Literally and spiritually.

426
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:37,100
 But even more importantly, God has our back.

427
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,100
 When you and I remind ourselves of the truth

428
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:48,100
 that we are more prone to lay our side our fear and insecurities.

429
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:54,100
 The truth that God is for you and not against you matters greatly.

430
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,100
 It's not me against the world.

431
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,100
 You are not made to hate yourself.

432
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:07,100
 You are made to know that you are loved.

433
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,100
 Look at the table for a moment.

434
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,100
 Now forget the Taobao plastic food.

435
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,100
 And pretend for a moment.

436
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,100
 There's a banquet there.

437
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:31,100
 But you cannot enjoy it if your fists are clenched.

438
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,100
 You go out after dinner, go to a restaurant and clench your fist.

439
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,100
 You can't enjoy your dinner.

440
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
 Back to Psalm 23, verse 5 says,

441
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:45,100
 "You anoint my head with oil and my cup overflows."

442
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,100
 Now to understand this,

443
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:54,100
 you need to know that the biggest enemy of the sheep is not the big bad wolf.

444
00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:03,100
 The biggest enemy of the sheep is tiny little parasites and flies.

445
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:09,100
 They attempt to lay their eggs in the sheep's nose.

446
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,100
 Yuck! It's disgusting. It's gross.

447
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
 They lay their eggs in the sheep nose.

448
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:24,100
 And so the shepherd would cover the sheep's head in oil.

449
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:33,100
 God through His Word wants to protect you from aggravation, lies and deceit.

450
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,100
 But there's more.

451
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,100
 Jesus wants your life to overflow.

452
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,100
 To reflect the bounty of the table.

453
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,100
 Again, forget the plastic flute for just a moment.

454
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:59,100
 Generosity is the business card of everyone who dines with Him.

455
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,100
 You don't hoard God's blessing.

456
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:11,100
 And so you pass out steak dinners to everyone, even your enemies.

457
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,100
 I want to tell you this. You'll never forget this.

458
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:19,100
 Generosity is impossible with closed fists.

459
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,100
 I'm going to say that again. I want you to remember this for the rest of your life.

460
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:29,100
 Generosity is impossible with closed fists.

461
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:36,100
 You can only give with open palms.

462
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,100
 I want to help change your script tonight.

463
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,100
 From everyone is against me.

464
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,100
 Everybody hates me.

465
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:51,100
 To God is for me. God has my back.

466
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,100
 The Lord Almighty is for you.

467
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,100
 So not everyone is against you.

468
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:05,100
 Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.

469
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:17,100
 My last finger represents the lie that there is no way out.

470
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:24,100
 If you feel like you're surrounded and there is no way out, the enemy is at your table.

471
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:31,100
 Now why I've left this one to the last one is it is the classic lie of the enemy.

472
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:38,100
 It's the ultimate that combines several of the lies I've addressed in this sermon.

473
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,100
 The enemy convinces you there is nowhere to turn.

474
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,100
 Nowhere to run.

475
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
 No way forward.

476
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:56,100
 No chance you are ever going to live again.

477
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:03,100
 One of the hardest parts of a pastor's job I have is conducting funerals.

478
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:13,100
 But I have to say the hardest part of the hardest part is suicide.

479
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:20,100
 Among those for me in the last couple of years have been a young lady, a committed Christian,

480
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:29,100
 jumping from a 46th floor after online abuse from a former boyfriend.

481
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:44,100
 And a businessman whose luxury hotels he had built in Italy fell victim to a financial crash because of COVID.

482
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:57,100
 I'm not here tonight to give you glib answers because these and situations that you may have been going through are real.

483
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:08,100
 But if you feel like you are surrounded, I've got some good news for you.

484
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,100
 You are surrounded.

485
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:16,100
 But it's better than you think.

486
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:29,100
 As I move towards the close of this sermon, I want to draw on some more recent Christian songs for illustration.

487
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:33,100
 Michael W. Smith in his song "Surrounded" says this.

488
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:43,100
 This is how I fight my battles. Just when you think you're lost, it may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by you.

489
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:53,100
 Hey, it may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by you.

490
00:33:53,100 --> 00:34:03,100
 And this song draws us to the story of Elisha and the God of angel armies.

491
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,100
 Another song.

492
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,100
 We read in 2 Kings 6.

493
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:18,100
 The God's prophet Elisha found himself in this situation after giving valuable advice to Israel's army.

494
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:27,100
 The king of Syria decided to take Elisha as a prisoner and he sent an army to the city where the prophet was staying.

495
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:35,100
 Under the cover of darkness, the Syrian warriors surrounded the city.

496
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:41,100
 When Elisha's servant woke early in the morning to begin his usual routine,

497
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:48,100
 he found himself looking out at an army of Syrians.

498
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:54,100
 He cried out to his master in panic. "What shall we do?"

499
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,100
 For the prophet Elisha, the choice was clear.

500
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:03,100
 And his answer to the servant was simple and full of faith.

501
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:15,100
 He said this, "Don't be afraid for those who are with us are more than those who are against us."

502
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:22,100
 This would have been really difficult for the servant to accept as he looked out and he looked at a wall of enemies

503
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,100
 bristling with spears and shields.

504
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:35,100
 The servant didn't see anybody ready and willing to fight on their side.

505
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:40,100
 But Elisha saw it in a completely different situation.

506
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,100
 He spoke to the Lord on behalf of his servant and we read this.

507
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:54,100
 That Elisha prayed and said, "Oh Lord, please open his eyes that he might see."

508
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:03,100
 Suddenly the servant was able to see with the same enlightened eyes as Elisha.

509
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:07,100
 The hills around the city weren't empty at all.

510
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:15,100
 A mighty host of horses and chariots of fire stood in wait,

511
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,100
 sent by the Lord to protect his prophet.

512
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,100
 We read this, "So the Lord opened the eyes of the young man

513
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:33,100
 and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha."

514
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:42,100
 The Syrians began to advance on the city, unaware that they were now vastly outnumbered.

515
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:51,100
 Elisha spoke to God again asking, "Strike this people I pray with blindness."

516
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:58,100
 Chaos broke out in the Syrian ranks as the entire army suddenly went blind.

517
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:10,100
 My friends, in a matter of moments, Elisha's simple faith reduced a seemingly unstoppable foe to nothing.

518
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:17,100
 Now this story was the inspiration behind Chris Tomlin's song, "God of Angel Armies."

519
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,100
 The chorus goes like this, we've sung it here before.

520
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,100
 I know who goes before me.

521
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,100
 I know who stands behind.

522
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:34,100
 The God of angel armies is always by my side.

523
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:40,100
 The same is true for you and for me.

524
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,100
 Now it may be true that circumstances are closing.

525
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:51,100
 Your whole world is surrounded by threats, accusations, missiles.

526
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,100
 The enemy says you're doomed.

527
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:59,100
 There's no way out.

528
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:11,100
 But I tell you that God has everyone and everything surrounding you, surrounded.

529
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:22,100
 Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.

530
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,100
 There's another in the fire.

531
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,100
 We're going to finish now and ask the band to return.

532
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:37,100
 And my inspiration actually comes from another song.

533
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:46,100
 Two years ago, I was in Brisbane, Australia for the funeral of a close friend.

534
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:51,100
 It was actually my son's father-in-law.

535
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:58,100
 Somebody I'd known and loved for over 30 years.

536
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:05,100
 On the Friday night, the day before the funeral, I visited Hillsong Church in Brisbane

537
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,100
 and heard this song, the one that we sang earlier for the very first time.

538
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,100
 It was written by a young man called Chris Davenport,

539
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:22,100
 whose son had been recently diagnosed with autism.

540
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:32,100
 It comes from the story of Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego in the book of Daniel.

541
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:37,100
 To put things briefly, all people, including these three men,

542
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:43,100
 under the jurisdiction of King Nebuchadnezzar, were ordered to worship an idol

543
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:49,100
 or face the penalty of being hurled into a furnace.

544
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,100
 Due to their faith, Shadrach and Co. refused.

545
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,100
 Of course, they weren't desiring to be burnt alive.

546
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:08,100
 But under the faith that if God so wills, he will save them from such a terrible fate.

547
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:13,100
 Ultimately, the men were indeed cast into the fire.

548
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:19,100
 But instead of three of them, we see the picture in the furnace.

549
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,100
 There appeared four men.

550
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:29,100
 The fourth being either an angel or, some people believe, Jesus.

551
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:38,100
 The long and the short of this story is that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego

552
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:52,100
 came out of the furnace unscathed, not even a burn mark on them.

553
00:40:52,100 --> 00:41:00,100
 May this be our testimony.

554
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:06,100
 I invite you to stand.

555
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:12,100
 I just want to read this chorus to you and then we're going to sing it now.

556
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:16,100
 There's another in the fire, standing next to me.

557
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,100
 There's another in the waters, holding back the sea.

558
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,100
 And should I ever need reminding what power set me free,

559
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:30,100
 there is a grave that holds no body.

560
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:37,100
 Now that power lives in me.

561
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:49,100
 Now that power lives in you, my friends.

562
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:58,100
 When the enemy tries to spin lies, when he tries to sit at your table,

563
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:07,100
 there is one who is there with you and he will take you through this.

564
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:16,100
 So as we sing this, may you sing this in an act of faith,

565
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:22,100
 as a testimony to the one who is in the fire with us.

566
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,100
 Let's sing together.

567
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:35,100
