[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   >> Good evening, everyone. Good to see you. I am looking -- the camera is right there.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.040]   It's the one with the red light, right? Okay. Hi, everyone. Wow. How much things have changed.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:23.480]   It's been one week. Who would have thought? The first of January was only last week and
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.840]   we were all still meeting. Still grateful that we get to at least have a few of us come
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.320]   here and just do this service. But it's -- what a roller coaster. What a roller coaster that
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.280]   it's been. And what an irony that it is that we get to start this new series on emotional
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.720]   health. And suddenly all this change happens. I had a New Year's resolution to start going
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:54.280]   to the gym. And I guess I can't do that anymore. I guess it will have to be next year. I was
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.520]   really intent on this would be the year that it would happen. But I felt like God just
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.480]   found it so important to stop me that he made all this happen. So anyway, I'm blessed. Hope
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.120]   you are blessed. What is emotional health? What is emotional health? Haven't we been
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.640]   going through enough in these last few years to start to feel what that might be? And almost
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.680]   even though it's ironic, maybe it's fitting. Maybe it's fitting that as we talk about emotional
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.120]   health, it's how do we stay healthy when things aren't going our way? It's almost okay, quite
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.840]   easy to go to say, hey, I'm well. Everything is well when everything else is well. But
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.400]   when things aren't going well, when things are out of your control, when things are uncertain,
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.520]   how do we remain emotionally healthy? And so this week we're jumping straight into the
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.160]   deep end. Even as the first week of the series, we're jumping straight into the deep end and
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.200]   looking at one of the most serious emotions, which is experiencing sorrow. And for me,
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.920]   as I'm thinking and as I'm reflecting about what it means to be emotionally healthy, it's
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.680]   to also be very much aware of the emotions that we're facing. So for example, faced with
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:07.640]   uncertainty, faced with grief, faced with loss, the emotionally healthy response isn't
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.240]   to say, everything is awesome, everything is fine, everything is good. That's not the
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.440]   emotionally healthy response. The emotionally healthy response is to say, things have been
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:28.000]   so hard. That is the emotionally healthy response. We've heard as we've gained awareness of mental
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.520]   health these last few years, that we've heard the statement, it's okay to not be okay. And
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   as we look today into one of the strongest, strongest emotions, one that is brought about
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.160]   right in the depths of your heart, sorrow, when we face grief, we're actually encouraged
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.440]   that actually to be emotionally healthy is to also embrace that emotion. It's the emotion
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.640]   that none of us really want to face. Myself personally, I've lived a very blessed life.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.160]   God has been very good, but I've been no stranger to grief, no stranger to sorrow. And I've
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.760]   shared before that actually it's in those moments of loss, and whether it's losing a
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.800]   loved one or even losing a family pet, let's not underestimate the pain that comes with
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.920]   losing even an animal that God's blessed us with, right? And the heart-wrenching loss
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.000]   that you feel. And I've shared before that even in those times when I'm going through
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.320]   those moments of sorrow, moments of grief, in some ways, it's what makes us human. Suffering
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.600]   isn't a part, apart from the human experience, but it's a part of it. And as I look in Scripture,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.440]   I'm encouraged because it seems as though it's everywhere. Sorrow is everywhere. Now,
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.280]   sometimes we think when we're Christians, we're supposed to be fully happy. We're supposed
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.680]   to say, "Hey, we're #blessed, so we're super happy all the time." And to rejoice is a choice,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.480]   so we have to keep rejoicing. Philippians 4, Paul says, "Rejoice," and then he says,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.880]   "I'm going to say it again, rejoice." And so we take into this mindset that, "Man, we've
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.480]   got to stay happy throughout everything that's happening." But then you look deeper into
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.200]   Scripture and you're like, "Oh my goodness, there is so much sorrow." It's almost as though
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.080]   the Bible is giving us an instruction manual on how to deal with sorrow. We see the Psalms
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.440]   and we see, "Oh Lord, how excellent your name is. How great are you, Lord. Your love endures
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.600]   forever." Yet two-thirds, over two-thirds of the Psalms are laments, an ancient term
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.880]   for basically venting, for expressing all your frustration and all your anger. Two-thirds
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:44.120]   of the Psalms are about David lamenting. As the author writes to God, he's lamenting,
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.360]   he's venting to God, he's angry at God. He's filled with sorrow. Psalm 42, "Why are you
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.680]   downcast, O my soul?" And then we look at some other characters in the Bible. We look
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.960]   at Elijah and see if this works. Brilliant. Job. Job, we know, has this huge challenge
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.960]   at the beginning of this book of Job, where we see he loses his family. We see he loses
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.040]   his property. We see he loses his health. And then he has this response. And this is
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.580]   chapter three. At the end of chapter three, he has three friends who come and basically
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.520]   spend some time with him. And they see him going through so much sorrow, they have nothing
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.920]   to say. The end of chapter two says, "These three friends stay with Job and sit with him
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.200]   for seven days without saying a word, because they don't know what to say." Seven days of
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.760]   just sitting, looking at this friend who's just lost his family, who's just lost his
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.120]   property and who's losing his, whose health is falling apart. They just sit there. And
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.520]   then finally, in chapter three, finally, after seven days, he opens his mouth. And what does
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.800]   he say? He curses, he curses the fact that he's even born. And he says, "For my sighing
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.160]   comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water. For the thing that
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.880]   I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me. I am not at ease, nor am I quiet. I have
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:10.440]   no rest, but trouble comes." We see deep sorrow here with Job. And then you look at Elijah.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:18.840]   Elijah, the famous prophet, who manages to defeat Baal and all his prophets, but then
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.760]   ends up getting chased by this evil queen and goes into a desert and straight away,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.240]   straight after this huge mountaintop experience, after this big victory, then goes right down
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.640]   and plummets into the valley. Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.760]   and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there. But he himself
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.640]   went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. And
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.480]   what did he do? And he asked that he might die, saying, "It's enough now, O Lord. Take
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.880]   away my life, for I am no better than my father's." And he lay down and slept under a broom, and
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:58.800]   behold, an angel touched him and said to him, "Arise and eat." Elijah goes through this
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.640]   incredible high, but then this incredible low, and experiences the sorrow to the point
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:09.560]   where he says, "That's enough. I'm done. Take my life." Some of us maybe even know how that
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.400]   feels to be in that position where, like, "God, life is not worth living. Why was I
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:22.480]   even born? Take my life now. It's done." And we see God being ever so patient, even with
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.040]   Elijah. This passage continues, and it's one of theâ€”and what does God do in response
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.360]   to this? He bakes him a cake. Have a look at it. Carry on with this chapter. God actually
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:39.280]   bakes him a cake and says, "Eat." It's okay. It's going to be fine.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.720]   And then you have David, one of the most famous kings of Israel, a man after God's own heart.
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.880]   Yet so many of his psalms I just said, so many of his songs, so many of his journal
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   entries, "My tears have been my food day and night, while they say to me all the day
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.000]   long, 'Where is your God?' Attend to me and answer me. I am restless in my complaint,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.440]   and I moan. My heart is in anguish within me. The terrors of death have fallen upon
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:13.080]   me." We see sorrow everywhere in Scripture. So the real question is, how are we supposed
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.920]   to deal with sorrow? How are we supposed to experience it and then overcome it? And as
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:27.000]   we look in Scripture, how do we basically not just be allowed to grieve, but then almost
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.680]   in some ways grow from that grieving? Paul talks about this in 1 Thessalonians, and he
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.880]   says, "Hey, we're allowed to grieve. In fact, we're supposed to grieve, but we don't want
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.960]   you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep. But you may not grieve as
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:45.040]   others do who have no hope." So you can grieve. We are supposed to grieve. It's part of the
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.000]   human experience. It's part of all our emotions. Yet when we grieve, we don't grieve as those
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:00.240]   who have no hope. Why? Why are we able to grieve without it not being the same way as
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.320]   those who have no hope? Why? Because we have hope. Where do we get that hope from? Jesus.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.920]   Why? We grieve because we know that we're only grieving temporarily. We're only grieving
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.000]   temporarily. This loss we feel, this sorrow we feel, we know is only temporary. Now, I'm
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.920]   not saying it's only going to be five minutes. I'm not saying it's only going to be 10 days.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.560]   I'm not going to say it's just going to be two weeks. But we don't grieve temporarily
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:36.160]   because of what Jesus did. Because He Himself experienced grief. He Himself experienced
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.720]   sorrow. He Himself then overcame it. He Himself experienced death and then defeated death.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.640]   And because of that, we don't grieve as others do who have no hope. So today we're going
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.960]   to look at Scripture. And Anthony, thank you for reading that passage here. Because it's
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:55.120]   one of the times where we see Jesus dealing with sorrow. Most of the time we see Jesus
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:10:02.680]   just epitomising calm. He says to the wind and the waves, "Peace, be still." I don't
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.920]   imagine anywhere in Scripture does Jesus walk faster than three miles per hour. He's just
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.680]   floating and just walking and just plodding along, going from thing to thing, person to
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:19.600]   person, doing whatever He needs to do. And yet here we finally see Him experience sorrow.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.360]   And actually, even in this short passage, even in these few verses, there are some tips
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:30.800]   that we can glean from. That's how the Son of God, that's how the Son of Man experienced
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.320]   sorrow. These are the things that we can learn from. And today I wanted to share really three
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:40.120]   things. And they're these. When He deals with the sorrow, how He deals with the sorrow,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:45.240]   and finally, why He deals with the sorrow. As we look at this passage from Matthew 6,
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.640]   verse 23. Let's go straight into, first of all, when He deals with sorrow. He doesn't
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.280]   deal with it that much as we can see, but one of the big times of when He deals with
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:58.240]   the sorrow is in the Garden of Gethsemane. "And then Jesus went with him to a place called
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.280]   Gethsemane. And He said to the disciples, 'Sit here while I go over there and pray.'
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:06.040]   And taking with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee," who are James and John, "He
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.520]   began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then He said to them, 'My soul is very sorrowful,
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:16.080]   even to death. Remain here and watch with Me.'" So this is when He deals with sorrow.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.600]   Let me give you a bit of context here. So this happens after the Last Supper. And they've
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.480]   had a really long, big dinner. And Jesus has said a whole ton of stuff at the Last Supper.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.800]   You can see it from John, chapter 13 to 17. He says a ton of stuff. They have a very long
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.920]   time together. And as they usually do, and in one of the other Gospels, this is what
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.160]   they say. As they usually do, they head to the Mount of Olives. Mount of Olives. And
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.360]   within the Mount of Olives, which is what they usually do, they would then head to a
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:48.560]   Garden of Gethsemane. Now, it says here that actually, but just before that, if you rewind
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:53.080]   a little bit, chapter 26, verse 30, this is when they sung a hymn and they went to the
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.520]   Mount of Olives. So it's really interesting. It's that they've had dinner. We've all
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.080]   had dinner before with a big group of people. And then they sing some hymns, which again
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.320]   would have been the custom. Likely, they would have sang some of the Psalms because they
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.880]   would have known the Psalms very well. And then they head to the Mount of Olives. And
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:14.040]   then they head to this Garden of Gethsemane. The word Gethsemane, it means oil press. This
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.000]   Mount of Olives, of course, there would be lots of olives. And this garden in particular
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.560]   is where the olives would be crushed for oil. So he goes to this garden where olives are
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:33.120]   crushed. And it's in this garden where he himself, his soul is crushed. And we see here
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.480]   that he takes his disciples with him. He takes them all with him. And then he says, "Hey,
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.840]   you guys sit over here whilst I go and pray." And then he takes three of them, Peter, James
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.960]   and John, and he goes a bit further into the garden with these three. These are the same
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.360]   three that he took to the Mount of Transfiguration. Because these three are known to be the ones
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.880]   who are extra close to Jesus. And he takes them with him. Why does he take these three?
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:04.320]   In fact, it's actually these three who have declared themselves ready to do whatever they
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.160]   need to do. It was Peter who was just a few verses before saying, "Hey, Jesus, I'm willing
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.840]   to follow you anywhere, even if it means to die. I'm going to follow you." And James and
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.960]   John, the two brothers, a couple of few chapters before in chapter 20, you have their mum who
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:26.000]   takes the two of them and goes to Jesus and say, "Jesus, when you're in your kingdom,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.520]   can both my sons be on either side of you? Can they sit on either side of you?" Sounds
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.360]   like a Chinese mum, right? "Can I reserve a spot for my two sons?" And what does Jesus
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:41.640]   say? Jesus says, "You don't know what you're asking. You do not know what you're asking.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.880]   Can they drink the same cup that I'm about to drink?" So these three have declared themselves
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.760]   ready. "Jesus, we're willing to go with you and we want to sit with you wherever you go."
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.200]   So Jesus takes them into the Garden of Gethsemane. And here we see whether they're really ready
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:03.600]   or not. And it's in this moment where we start to see the true human nature of Jesus. The
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.800]   divine course was already set. He knew why he came to this earth. He knew what this garden
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:13.060]   was going to be about. He knew what this evening was going to be about. And yet in this moment,
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:21.640]   he began to be sorrowful and troubled. It's in this moment we see Jesus himself experiencing
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:27.920]   this extreme grief. The word there for sorrowful and troubled is actually deeply grieved, almost
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:34.040]   facing a horror, almost severe shock. In another version in the Bible, actually even in his
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:40.000]   sweat there starts to be blood coming out. And that only happens when someone is experiencing
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.160]   severe shock. So we see here, Jesus is going through that kind of sorrow. Maybe a sorrow
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:52.560]   that's even way more intense than anything that we've gone through. So that's when he
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.640]   deals with the sorrow. And hopefully that sets the table for you as to then looking
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.920]   into how he deals with the sorrow. So how he deals with the sorrow, I'd say this is
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.160]   the main part of my message here. And there's really a couple of things that we can highlight
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.840]   here. From this passage, "Then he said to them, 'My soul is very sorrowful, even to
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:13.480]   death. Remain here and watch with me.' And going a little farther, he fell on his face
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:19.680]   and prayed, saying, 'My father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless,
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:25.880]   not as I will, but as you will.'" So as he takes Peter, James, and John further into
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:33.920]   this garden where olives are crushed, his soul begins to crush. And here we see how
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.600]   he deals with it. Even in these short two verses here, we can get a glimpse of how Jesus
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:45.040]   deals with sorrow, how the Son of God, the Prince of Heaven deals with sorrow. And there's
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.400]   three things I want to highlight even from these two verses here is this. One, he doesn't
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:56.240]   face it alone. Two, he doesn't hide his feelings. And three, he doesn't avoid the pain. One,
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.960]   he doesn't face it alone. Two, he doesn't hide his feelings. And three, he doesn't
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:06.160]   avoid the pain. So we see here, he doesn't face it alone. The Son of God himself says,
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:12.440]   "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with me." The Son of
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:20.280]   God himself, the one who reveals the very presence of God to others, now is in need
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:30.360]   of human companionship, moral support. This is just a supreme illustration of the paradox
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:38.800]   of the incarnation, where we see Jesus as fully God, but also as fully man. And he says
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:48.000]   to these three, he says, "Stay with me. I need you tonight. I am in a place, I am filled
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:57.160]   with sorrow. I'm a wreck tonight. Stay with me." So Jesus recognized the need when dealing
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:02.680]   with sorrow to not do it alone. So I guess the question that we have for ourselves is,
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:11.080]   when we face grief, when we face loss, when we face anxiety, when we face sorrow, do we
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:16.280]   face it alone? So often we do, right? So often we think, "You know what? No one needs to
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:21.080]   know about this. No one needs to hear about this. Why would anyone be interested in this?
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.920]   Why would anyone be... You know what? Time is money here in Hong Kong. Why would anyone
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:31.320]   want to give their time to walk with me whilst I'm feeling like this?" And yet Jesus himself
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:38.560]   doesn't... Isn't afraid to reach out. Isn't afraid to say, "Watch with me. Stay with me
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:45.160]   because I need you this evening." So when we face sorrow, we actually need to pluck
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.080]   up the courage to go to the people that we... Maybe there's three people that we can reach
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:56.000]   out to. Three people that we can... "Today is not a good day. I just need to reach...
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.320]   I just need to tell you that. Even that will help. I just need to reach out to you. Actually,
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.240]   if you have time, I'd love to spend some time. Can you come over? Can I come over to yours?
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.480]   Can I invite myself over for dinner?" Whatever it may be, it requires us to take that first
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.320]   step, just as Jesus is, in not facing the sorrow that we have alone. So I don't know
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.880]   whether any of us here or any of us watching online are facing the sorrow, facing this
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:25.520]   loneliness that comes with dealing with grief, with dealing with uncertainty. The encouragement
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:34.920]   here is don't face it alone. But also, as little Christs, as Christians, as little Jesuses,
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:40.220]   we also have to be sensitive to those around us because we recognise that it takes so much
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:46.760]   courage to step out and say, "I need help." We need to be sensitive to those we meet.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:51.120]   So when we're talking to people, to ask them genuinely, "How are you doing? Is there anything
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.640]   that I can do to pray with you? Is there... Actually, if it's going really bad, then can
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.360]   I just come and hang out?" I have no answers. I have zero answers. I've been faced with
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:06.080]   this recently as I've met and been connected with just different families who have just
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:11.060]   had some really just tragic circumstances happen to them. I have zero answers. I'm no
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.880]   expert in any of those things. And my prayer is, "God, would you just let me go and sit
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:25.240]   with them?" Just like Job's three friends sat with him. We need each other. And of course,
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:31.360]   during COVID now, this has been highlighted even more. This isn't an extrovert, introvert
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:37.160]   thing. We all need people around us. Maybe some people only in small doses, but we still
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:44.160]   need people around us. So when dealing with sorrow, don't face it alone. Do not be afraid
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.680]   to reach out to people. And do not be afraid to be the one that reaches out to those who
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:55.240]   you feel may be in need. Do not face it alone. And the second thing Jesus does is he doesn't
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.840]   hide his feelings. He doesn't hide his feeling from Peter and James and John. He tells them,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:06.000]   "My soul is sorrowful even to death." He actually tells them how he's feeling. So that's the
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.640]   don't face it alone part. But he also doesn't hide it to God. He also doesn't hide it to
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:17.080]   God because then he turns to God and his prayer is intense because he falls on his face and
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:24.720]   he says, "My Father, my Father." He goes to the strongest connection he has here. "My
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:30.640]   Father." He just taught the disciples how to pray earlier saying, "Our Father in heaven,
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:38.480]   hallowed be thy name." But in a time of sorrow, he goes, "My Father, my Father." And he doesn't
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.800]   hide from God. He doesn't hide his feelings from God. And then he starts to pray. And
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.920]   this tells me when we are going through sorrow, when we are going through grief, the most
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:56.640]   important thing is that we remain devoted to praying, remain devoted to seeking God's
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.520]   heart. And we see this time and time again in Scripture, whether it's Hannah, mother
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:07.880]   of Samuel, Mary, whatever emotions they have, they just burst into prayer. David, time and
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:12.640]   time again, just bursting into prayer, even when they don't feel like it. It's important.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:19.400]   It's imperative that when we face sorrow, we do not hide our feelings and that we actually
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.920]   approach Him and tell Him what we're going through. We see most of the time, I don't
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:29.640]   know about you, we try and maintain the stiff upper lip when it comes to God. We may be
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.640]   going through a whole ton of stuff at home or at work, but when we turn up at church
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.160]   or a Bible study, we just kind of sit up straight and we go, "Yes, dear, dear Father God, thank
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:43.440]   you for this time that we've had here. Thank you for this. Thank you for that. And yeah,
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:49.000]   help us be this. In Jesus' name, Amen." When actually, we're trying just to keep composed
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.920]   and just keep it on the surface, when actually God knows the things that are going on in
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.160]   our hearts. And actually more than anything, He just wants us to share with Him, not to
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:04.040]   hide those feelings from Him. I can imagine my children, if they're going through something
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.840]   that has really upset them, and when they come to me, I see their lips shaking. I see
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.360]   that they're genuinely upset and flustered. But when they talk to me, they're still trying
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.960]   to hide it. As a father, as a parent, what's the thing that you want them to do the most?
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:24.320]   It isn't to maintain their composure. It's for them to tell you what's going on. It's
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.600]   for them to be able to share with you those feelings. And that's God's heart for all of
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.720]   us. That when we're experiencing sorrow, that we don't hide our feelings, but that we go
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:41.260]   to Him and that we pray whatever is on our hearts. Jesus just showed us then a model.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.600]   When you pray, you should pray like this, "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.440]   And it's only very towards the end that you start presenting your requests. But in that
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:54.600]   time of need, when His soul is sorrowful, He goes, "My Father," and then He goes straight
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:23:01.040]   into, "If it be possible, let this cup pass from me." You see, in Philippians 4, which
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:06.680]   I just referred to, chapter 4 is, "Rejoice, I say again, rejoice. The Lord is at hand.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:12.040]   Don't be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and supplication and thanksgiving,
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.360]   present your requests to God." That's what the Apostle Paul says, right? And in ideal
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:22.000]   circumstances, that's the best, that we don't be anxious about anything, that we let go,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.240]   and that we present our requests to God with thanksgiving. But here, we see something very
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:33.200]   different. In that moment of sorrow, the Son of God Himself praised Him, "My Father," and
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.280]   He goes straight into the cry of His heart. In Hebrews chapter 5, it actually says it.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.680]   It says, "In the days of His flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, but
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:50.400]   not thanksgiving, with loud cries and tears." Think back to the last time you were genuinely
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:58.640]   sorrowful, genuinely distraught, and genuinely angry at God. How did you approach Him? How
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:05.280]   did you talk to Him? Was it maintaining that stiff upper lip? Or was it doing what Jesus
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:12.520]   did? Was it doing what David did? Was it doing what Elijah did? Just, "God, things are not
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:18.860]   good. Things are not well." Let us not hide our feelings from God. He isn't afraid to
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:25.840]   hide His feelings, and He also isn't afraid to make His requests. So, He still prays,
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:35.200]   "Can this cup pass? My Father, I'm filled with sorrow. I am troubled. Can we avoid this?
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.880]   Is there another way?" Sometimes we think when bad things happen to us, we're not even
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:45.720]   allowed to say anything. But here is a Father that truly loves us and truly knows what's
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:52.840]   best for us, and actually welcomes us to make those requests, to ask, just as Jesus did.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:59.480]   You know what? Jesus here wasn't questioning whether He should obey God or not. That's
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:04.800]   not what He was doing. He wasn't asking whether He should follow the Father's purpose. He
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:10.360]   was always going to follow the Father's purpose. What He was asking was, "Does that purpose
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:16.520]   need to have this cup?" He was saying, "God, I'm going to follow You whichever way, but
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:22.160]   I'm just asking, does it have to be this way? Because You know I will follow You, but my
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:28.360]   weakness, my sorrow is just, I just can't help but feel, I can't help but want to ask,
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:35.140]   is there another way?" He's not afraid to hide his feelings. He doesn't hide his feelings.
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:41.480]   He doesn't even stop and not make any requests. He does. But He also, and the final point
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:48.520]   is, He also doesn't avoid the pain. Even though He isn't afraid to make a request, He also
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:55.320]   isn't afraid to accept whatever the Father's will is. He knew, and we now know, that the
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:26:02.220]   only way was still to take this cup. And so the final thing is, He doesn't face it alone,
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:08.520]   He doesn't hide His feelings, and He also doesn't avoid the pain. Even in this, He says,
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:16.200]   "Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will." Never was there a moment where He thought,
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:22.560]   "God, I'm not going to obey You. I'm not going to avoid this pain. I'm still going to pursue
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.400]   Your heart, even when it isn't the easiest. In fact, this is going to be the hardest thing
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:33.000]   that I ever have to face, to be separated from You, God, but I will do it." And for
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.200]   us, when we're filled with that sorrow, it's important that we also don't avoid that pain.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.640]   That we still choose that path that God has set out for us. That song that we sang earlier,
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.960]   that even what the enemy meant for evil, God will turn for good. That's the trust that
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.160]   we have. So even though we walk through this valley of the shadow of death, we will fear
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:56.240]   no evil, because we know that He is with us. So we're not going to avoid the pain, we're
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.760]   going to keep going, because we know that this is where the Lord is leading. And we
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:08.560]   realise and we recognise the way of the cross necessitates that pain to be there, because
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:15.400]   then it precedes the healing and the restoration that will come. And so as believers, just
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:22.160]   as Jesus did, we must not avoid the pain. And time and time again, when I found myself
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:27.760]   in hospital, when I found myself facing loss, it's in those moments where I'm like, "You
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.080]   know what? I'm not going to avoid it. I'm not going to deny it. I'm just going to lean
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:40.120]   in to it. I am just going to lean into it." Recognising this emotion sorrow is a real
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.560]   emotion. It's one that I do not like that much at all, but I know it's part of being
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:50.880]   human. And I know it's one that Jesus had Himself. So I don't face it alone. So I don't
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:58.240]   hide my feelings. And I don't avoid the pain, because I recognise as I go through this way,
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:04.160]   this is the way that will bring healing and restoration. And so Jesus says, the words
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.720]   that He taught His disciples, when you pray, you pray like this, "Your kingdom come, your
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:16.880]   will be done." He follows His own example. He becomes the supreme model. And in those
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:26.600]   words, "Your will be done," He transforms the fate of mankind. In fact, it's those very
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:33.240]   words but it's flipped that was said many thousands of years before that, that brought
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:41.600]   about the fall. It was Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden who said, "As I will, and
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:49.160]   not yours." "Not your will, but mine," says Adam and Eve. And in uttering those
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:57.080]   words, "Not your will, but mine," Adam and Eve transform paradise into desert, life
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:04.880]   into death. And it is now in the second Adam, the last Adam, Jesus Himself uses that very
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:12.200]   same phrase, but flips it around and says, "But now, it's not my will, but yours."
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:19.860]   He changes that desert. He changes that valley of dry bones back into life. He changes the
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:28.360]   Garden of Gethsemane into the kingdom of heaven. In that moment of sorrow, He doesn't avoid
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:36.980]   the pain and He chooses obedience. Hebrews 5, it says, "Jesus, in the days of His flesh,
[00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.980]   He prays with loud cries and tears." But then chapter 5, verse 8, it says, "And although
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:48.860]   He was a son, He learned obedience through what He suffered." And that's the encouragement
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:56.780]   for us as we deal with the sorrow, whatever it is that God has allowed to happen, we recognise
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:03.020]   that in His will, He will turn bad into good. There is something to be learned. Our job
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:12.620]   is to trust and obey, to keep going through that valley, knowing that He is with us.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:17.120]   And so, I've talked about when He dealt with that sorrow. I've talked about how He dealt
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:21.620]   with it and those three things. Don't face it alone. Don't hide your feelings and don't
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:28.140]   avoid the pain and lean into it. Finally then is, why did He have to go through it? Why
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:34.660]   did it suddenly come upon Him? Why does Jesus, the Son of God, who had the power to summon
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:41.120]   armies of angels to come and save Him, why did He choose to go through that sorrow? Apart
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.980]   from giving us a great template on how to deal with sorrow ourselves, why did He have
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:51.020]   to go through it? You look at this passage again. Let me just go back a bit. "And going
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:55.220]   unto the Father on His face and foot, it says, 'And He began'" Oh, you know what? It's too
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:31:01.780]   far now. "And He began to be sorrowful." What happened to Jesus, where in that moment, as
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:07.540]   He leaves His disciples behind, as He walks with these three, and suddenly, in that moment,
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:13.180]   He starts to feel that sorrow. In verse 37, "And talking with Him, Peter and the two sons
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:22.620]   of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful and troubled." Why? Why in that moment did He suddenly...
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:28.380]   He knew this was happening. Very early on in the Gospels, He'd say, "Hey, this is the
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:33.420]   reason I was sent, to provide the good news to the other towns as well." So He knew what
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.620]   was going to happen. And He'd told them before that the Son of Man is going to have to die,
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:43.080]   but then He'll be raised from the dead. But in this moment, why does He suddenly get overwhelmed
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:48.220]   with this sorrow? I think the clue is in that passage, and I'm just going to read from here.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:54.140]   Verse 36, it says, "Sit here while I go over there and pray." As He walks deeper into the
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:32:01.620]   garden with Peter, James, and John, what do you think He's doing? He's starting to pray.
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:08.660]   And it's in that moment, as He starts to pray, that He suddenly feels this sorrow. Why? Because
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:16.340]   He's suddenly feeling the wrath of God. The cup that He's talking about, what is this
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.580]   cup? What is this cup that He talks about, that He asked God, "Let this cup pass from
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:26.300]   me." See, in ancient times, they would have known what this cup represented. So often,
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:30.300]   people would be killed, executed by this cup. Why? Because if you'd done something wrong
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:36.180]   and you needed to die, they would give you a cup of poison. And then you would drink
[00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:41.140]   it, and then your insides would just completely explode. That is how you would die. Socrates,
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:46.280]   the philosopher, died by this cup. And so often, they would know that when someone is
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:53.900]   talking about cup, they're talking about suffering. They're talking about death. And in the Old
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:58.540]   Testament, this cup is also referred a lot to. And what does it represent? It represents
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:06.220]   the wrath of God. And so Jesus is saying, "Is there any other way? If there's any other
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:12.260]   way where this cup doesn't need to happen." He's saying, "Is there any other way that
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:18.980]   I don't feel the wrath of God? What is the wrath of God?" I think the moment He starts
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:24.020]   walking into this garden, the moment He starts to pray, the moment... He'll have done this
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:28.160]   so many times. Time and time again, you see in Scripture, Jesus goes into the woods and
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:32.940]   goes into the desert place, and He starts to pray. And He says, "I and the Father are
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:38.220]   one." He experiences constant communion with God. But for the first time ever, and for
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:44.140]   this time only, He goes into the garden, and He starts praying. He turns to God, and nothing
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:52.020]   is there. Because He is experiencing the cup. He is experiencing the wrath of God, which
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:34:05.220]   is what? God turning Himself away. That, brothers and sisters, is hell. Sometimes we have this
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:13.300]   image of hell with these little demons with pitchforks, and it's just black and red. But
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:23.780]   hell is separation from God. The wrath of God is God Himself turning His back on us.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:30.540]   And here we have Him turning His back on His only Son, His only Son whom He loved and who
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:37.660]   was well pleased. And in this garden of Gethsemane, His Son's soul is crushed, because in this
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:44.220]   moment He knew He had to take on the wrath of God on behalf of us. So as He turns to
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:52.960]   pray to God, nothing is there. Jonathan Edwards said this, "The agony that Jesus experienced
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:35:00.700]   in the garden was caused by a vivid, bright, full, immediate view of the wrath of God.
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:07.380]   When He turned to God this time, all He could see was the abyss." That was what brought
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:16.220]   the sorrow. That was what brought the trouble. And so why did He do that? Out of His love
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:22.980]   for us. Recognising that if He didn't do this, if He didn't take this cup, we would have
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:29.620]   to, because we would end up separating ourselves from God. So the only one who was never separated
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:37.700]   from God had to take our place so that we wouldn't be separated. The wrath of God turned
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:44.780]   loose on Him, so it wouldn't turn loose on us. So that we then would be able to approach
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:49.980]   this throne of God and be in His presence. But it all came because Jesus obeyed and was
[00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:58.240]   willing to take this cup Himself. What's even more infuriating or ridiculous is the very
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:03.460]   people that He was dying for, the very people He was taking this cup for. He's like, "This
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:08.260]   cup of poison, you should be the one that's taking this. Peter, James and John, you, you're
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:12.900]   falling asleep, but you should be the one that's taking this cup. Yet here I am taking
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:22.140]   it for you." And in some ways, are we not, Peter, James and John? We've seen God do amazing
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:27.940]   things. We were on the mountain and seeing this great thing. And yet, when He needed
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:37.060]   us the most, we would disappoint Him. And yet He still did it. And whilst we were still
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:43.860]   sinners, He still chose to die for us. And now, of course, He doesn't need that same
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:52.460]   moral support. Now we know that one day He'll come back in strength. And yet His call to
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:37:01.100]   us is the same. His call to a sleeping church, which is concerned about tons of other agendas
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:09.780]   other than waiting for the Lord Himself. He's saying, "Stay awake. Stay connected to me
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:15.720]   because I love you. And whilst you were still sinners, I died for you because I took on
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:22.640]   this cup for you. God turned His back away from me in that garden so that He wouldn't
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:34.500]   turn His back on you." And so for us, let us remember what Jesus did for us. Jesus is
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:42.180]   saying, you sum up this whole Bible. How do you sum it up? Love God and love people. And
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:47.080]   you know what? That's hard. But Jesus is saying, "Love God and love people and follow me, even
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:52.920]   when it's hard, even when it's stressful." And never, never have we ever seen someone
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:38:03.340]   love God and love people under this much stress, under this much sorrow. And yet He did. So
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:11.420]   for us, as we face sorrow ourselves, as we're surrounded by people in Hong Kong, in our
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:18.920]   churches that are faced with sorrow, let us remember not to face it alone. Let's not hide
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:27.320]   our feelings from one another, from God Himself. And also let's not avoid the pain. Let's lean
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:36.960]   into it. And as we lean into it, as we see God's purpose, may we trust and obey. And
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:47.440]   may we follow what Jesus Himself said. Nevertheless, whatever happens, your will and not mine.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:55.360]   Trusting that in those words, He will turn dry bones into life. He will turn desert into
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:07.840]   paradise. Let us pray.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:25.080]   So Jesus, we thank you for showing us what it means to be human. Lord, we are so weak,
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:32.680]   so much of the time, we are completely not in control. And Lord, things have not been
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:42.920]   okay. At the very least, these last three years in Hong Kong have not been the easiest.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:50.720]   And even with no sign of improvement, we take heart because we recognise that you are at
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:40:00.320]   our hand. But I pray, Lord, that for any of us here who are genuinely facing sorrow, who
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:11.600]   are deeply grieving, Lord, that your Spirit would give them the strength to grieve in
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:27.440]   the right way. Lord, we know to be emotionally healthy is to also grieve. But we grieve not
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:35.280]   as those who have no hope, because we grieve only temporarily. Because we know that there
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:45.440]   will be one day where you will return, where you will make all things new, where you will
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:55.640]   wipe away every tear, where there will be no death, where there will be no pain. Why?
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:05.840]   Not because of anything that we're able to do, but because in that garden, you chose
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:16.120]   the way of obedience. You took on the cup for us. You showed us the way. And then you
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:27.480]   became the way. And so because of that, we take heart. Because of that, we rejoice. And
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:35.840]   it's in what you did, our sorrow can be turned to joy. But Lord, right now, whilst we're
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:41.240]   still here waiting, would you draw close to us? Would you draw close to those online at
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:47.520]   home just watching? Lord, that your Spirit of peace would fill them, a peace that surpasses
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:42:01.200]   all understanding, a peace this world cannot give. We thank you, Lord, for showing us.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:10.640]   In such times of uncertainty, you are the only thing that is certain. And for that,
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.920]   we are thankful. And it's in your name we pray. Amen.
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
