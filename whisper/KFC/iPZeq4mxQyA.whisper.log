[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.340]   - What an intro, that's amazing.
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.880]   Just one more thing on the fast,
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.720]   and you know I'm very excited about this fast.
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.640]   There will be a three-day devotional,
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.100]   and Pastor Peter will write Thursday's devotional,
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.480]   Pastor Paul, Friday's, and I'll write Saturday's.
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.800]   It'll be mailed to you this week,
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.360]   so if you're wondering what to do when you're not eating,
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.480]   there'll be a devotional there for you.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.320]   Good.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.160]   I can't tell you how excited I am to be preaching to you,
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.160]   rather than preaching to a camera this week.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.880]   I think there's something of God's timing in this.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.220]   I think this is a really important message
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.160]   for our church, for our city today,
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.440]   and it's not by chance.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.560]   A few weeks ago, I felt God impress on me,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.560]   and it was this.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.160]   I believe God said to me, "Call a fast.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.920]   "Call a fast for the church,
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.560]   "and call a fast for the city."
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.320]   I found that actually God had actually been speaking
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.460]   to a number of other people across the city
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.960]   on this very, very same thing,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.120]   and we were able to come together at very short notice,
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.120]   and actually so much of the city is fasting together
[00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.080]   at an important time for this.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.220]   The other thing I felt that God said to me was this.
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.020]   I want you to preach the book of Esther,
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.480]   and that's why we've got Esther tonight.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.780]   We'd actually planned a series in Judges,
[00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.500]   which we'll have next month,
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.900]   and I felt God also say,
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.140]   "Would you please tell them that they were born
[00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.280]   "for such a time as this?"
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.380]   And you've heard that expression quite a lot
[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.420]   the last few months, but that comes from Esther 4.14,
[00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.620]   James will be preaching on it next week.
[00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.420]   So it's so important that we're doing this at this time,
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.120]   and we're doing this together.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.500]   So why are we looking at Esther?
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.800]   Well, the book of Esther is very counter-cultural.
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.700]   The book of Esther is a book about social justice,
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.440]   social justice actually done by a woman,
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.480]   social justice in a hostile society.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.420]   It reminds us, doesn't it, of being in Hong Kong
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.860]   for such a time as this, 2020.
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.380]   So what I did, I immersed myself in the book of Esther,
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.780]   and I wanna just honour here some of the people
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.580]   that I used in my research
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.140]   'cause they're particular favourites of mine,
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.340]   Mark Driscoll, Warren Wearsby,
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.860]   and especially one of my all-time favourite preachers,
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.940]   Tim Keller of Redeemer Church in New York City,
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.280]   whom I had the privilege to meet here in Hong Kong
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.680]   at the FCC for breakfast about 10 years ago.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.620]   His teaching on Esther has been a great help
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.580]   in piecing together this series,
[00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.380]   and we have leaned heavily on him
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.700]   at the same time as adding our own flavour.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.420]   You may have remembered in January,
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.620]   it was a long time ago, January,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.340]   when we were actually doing church in January,
[00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.460]   we did a series on Ephesians, on identity,
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.140]   and the founding pastor of Mars Hill, Mark Driscoll,
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.140]   wrote a book which all of our staff read together.
[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.620]   He makes five points, five unique things
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.620]   about Esther and the book of Esther.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.180]   And he says this, "Esther is a stunning story.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.660]   "The book of Esther has all the features
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.940]   "of a typical James Bond movie."
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.780]   Now, you know the James Bond movie was postponed.
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.820]   Well, the book of Esther has not been postponed.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.440]   So everything you would have got in James Bond,
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.500]   you've got in Esther.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.860]   It's a great plot.
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.900]   It's a beauty.
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.560]   There's a villain.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.620]   There's action.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.580]   There's death.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.540]   And the hero wins in the end.
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.780]   Actually, a heroine.
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.700]   "Like a Bond movie, it has some amazingly complex
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.560]   "and intriguing characters.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.800]   "From the godlike Xerxes,
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   "to Esther, the orphan girl raised by her cousin Mordecai,
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.140]   "and the scoundrel Haman."
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.300]   Now, I want a favour.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.200]   This is what you've got to remember for the next four weeks.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.740]   Every time I mention the word Haman,
[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.640]   I want you to boo.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.100]   Right?
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.800]   So let's have a little trial at this one, okay?
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.900]   It sounds even better through the masks.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.540]   The scoundrel Haman.
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.380]   We're getting there.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.460]   You simply cannot beat the characters in this cast.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.680]   Second thing is that Esther is painfully normal.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.860]   She grows up in a very lukewarm religious home
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.160]   as an orphan raised by her cousin.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.100]   She was beautiful,
[00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.020]   but she allows men to tend to her needs
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.360]   and makes her decisions.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.540]   Her behaviour, as we're gonna see tonight, is sinful.
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.580]   And she spends around a year in the spa
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.600]   getting dolled up to lose her virginity
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.300]   with the pagan king,
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.300]   at the same time as hundreds of other women.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.940]   She performs so well
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.100]   that he chooses her as his favourite.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.820]   We could actually say she shows no character
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.720]   until her own neck is on the line.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.780]   And then we see her gloriously rise up
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.600]   to save the life of her people.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.660]   Number three, quite strangely,
[00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.900]   the book of Esther has been quite widely avoided.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.920]   I read that there was zero commentaries on the book
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.180]   that were published in the first seven centuries
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.500]   of the Christian church.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.920]   As far as we can tell,
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.520]   John Calvin never preached from Esther
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.060]   and Martin Luther despised it.
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.500]   Very few preachers in the history of the church
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.740]   and more recent years have touched this book.
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:04.080]   Number four is that Esther has been greatly misinterpreted.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.960]   Feminists have tried to cast Esther's life
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.960]   as a tragic tale of male domination and female liberation.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.360]   Many evangelicals have ignored her sexual sin
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.980]   and godless behaviour
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.700]   and made her into a Daniel-like figure,
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.000]   which is inaccurate.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.300]   Some have even tried to tie her story
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.760]   into the modern day sex slave trafficking
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.400]   as she was brought before the powerful king
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.840]   as part of his harem.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.040]   What's the truth?
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.920]   We will see this over the next four weeks.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.760]   And fifthly, Esther is a godless book.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.340]   God is never mentioned in the book.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.020]   Esther is not mentioned anywhere else in the Bible.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.320]   No one prays, no miracles happen.
[00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.960]   God never shows up in any way.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.980]   But as we will see, God is throughout the book
[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.420]   like a silhouette.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.740]   He works throughout the book,
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.500]   not through his visible hand of miracle,
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.940]   but rather his invisible hand of providence.
[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.060]   I wanna give you an invitation today.
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.660]   I would invite you this week or the next few weeks
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.040]   to read the book of Esther.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.600]   Read or listen to it.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.300]   I timed it.
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:53.580]   It will take you less than 30 minutes.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.820]   Can I make a suggestion that during the fast,
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.500]   instead of doing Facebook, you read the book of Esther.
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.300]   If you read it this week,
[00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.600]   you will get so much more out of this series.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.820]   But what I'm gonna do anyway,
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.020]   I'm gonna give you the nine minute version.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:19.820]   Esther's story begins in 483 BC,
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.180]   103 years after Nebuchadnezzar
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.060]   had taken the Jews into captivity.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.600]   Esther lived in the kingdom of Persia,
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.220]   the dominant kingdom of the Middle East,
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.320]   following the fall of Babylon in 539 BC.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.940]   Esther was a Jew from the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.340]   That's very, very important.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.740]   The name Esther actually means star.
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.240]   Is anybody called Esther here?
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.980]   Esther actually means star.
[00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:56.180]   She was also known as Hadassah, which means myrtle.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.460]   Myrtle branches signify peace and thanksgiving.
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:06.000]   Esther first appears in Esther chapter two.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.600]   She's an orphan Jew brought up by her cousin Mordecai.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.980]   The book of Esther teaches much more
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.980]   than the life of one lady.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.700]   There are five main characters in this book.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:28.060]   King Xerxes, Queen Vashti, Mordecai,
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.060]   Mordecai, Esther, and wait for it, Haman.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:42.460]   As you read the story,
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:48.300]   make sure you understand the roles of these five characters.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:52.380]   So very quickly, in chapter one,
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.580]   King Xerxes decides to display his abundant wealth
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.900]   for 180 days, followed by a seven-day feast,
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:09.260]   a lavish display of his power.
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.100]   Now, why?
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.620]   He was planning to invade Greece,
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.260]   and the display was to demonstrate
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.380]   that he had sufficient wealth to carry it.
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.740]   As one of the world's wealthiest men,
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:29.620]   the Persian king would love to display his wealth.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:34.220]   And there is a legend that he even wore gemstones
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.120]   in his beard.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:40.380]   On the seventh day of the feast,
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:43.540]   King Xerxes calls Queen Vashti
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.920]   in order to display her beauty to the people.
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.780]   She refuses to come.
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.780]   And is eventually banished from the king's presence for life.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:02.400]   So a new queen is sought.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:09.060]   In chapter two, we read that Esther is chosen to be queen.
[00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:12.220]   She goes through the normal 12 months of beauty treatment
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.720]   before meeting the king.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:20.660]   Chapter two actually also records the good deed of Mordecai
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.020]   in saving the king's life by alerting him
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.100]   of an assassination attempt on his life.
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:32.860]   We read that the deed is recorded in the record books,
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.000]   and this later serves as a blessing for Mordecai.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.340]   In chapter three, Haman,
[00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.920]   that was pretty, getting pretty weak now.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.900]   In chapter three, Haman is honored by the king
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.180]   and given a high position in the kingdom.
[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.460]   Haman is annoyed.
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.220]   He's annoyed with Mordecai
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:03.220]   because Mordecai refuses to kneel down to him.
[00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:09.780]   Haman, his anger leads him to plot the execution
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.080]   of all the Jews in the kingdom.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.980]   Now, in order to prevent the execution of all the Jews,
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:24.980]   Mordecai calls on Esther to intercede to the king.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.020]   There's a problem here.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.960]   The king doesn't know that Esther is a Jew.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:38.740]   Esther has no idea how the king will respond to the news.
[00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:42.340]   So she's a little bit reluctant.
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.080]   And Esther's reluctance to approach the king
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.900]   is met with stern words from Mordecai in chapter four.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:57.540]   Chapter 4, 14, you're gonna hear this again next week.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.380]   He says this,
[00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.740]   "For if you keep silent at this time,
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.860]   relief and deliverance will rise
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.860]   for the Jews from another place,
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.540]   but you and your father's house will perish.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:18.020]   And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:23.340]   for such a time as this."
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.740]   For such a time as this is a theme of the series.
[00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:35.460]   Sorry, I hope that's God on the phone, by the way.
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.900]   Otherwise, maybe turn it off.
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.180]   You're taking a telephone, yeah, thank you.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:47.640]   For such a time of this is the theme of this series.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.120]   Now, why have I said that?
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:57.780]   You are not here in Hong Kong in 2020 by chance.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:04.420]   Whether you're here for a week,
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.460]   whether you're going back to China on Tuesday,
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.860]   whether you're here for a year,
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.980]   whether you're here for 10 years,
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.060]   whether you're here for the rest of your life,
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.340]   God has you here for a purpose.
[00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:25.180]   And I can say to you that you were born
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:30.120]   for such a time as this.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:37.260]   So Esther eventually agrees to appeal to the king.
[00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:39.900]   Prior to this, she asked Mordecai
[00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:44.440]   to organise a time of fasting for her.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.300]   She is well aware that she needs God's favour
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.440]   if she is to succeed.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.820]   In chapter five, Esther approaches the king
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:04.740]   and invites him and Haman to a banquet.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:12.060]   This is an attempt to get the timing right.
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:17.060]   Before she informs the king about Haman's
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.740]   (congregation exclaims)
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.760]   plot to kill the Jews of which she has won.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.580]   Esther had hid the fact that she was a Jew
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.380]   from the king on Mordecai's advice.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.820]   Meanwhile, Haman's
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.620]   (congregation exclaims)
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.340]   hatred for Mordecai is growing.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.740]   And on the advice of his friends and wife,
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:44.540]   he has special gallows prepared besides his house
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.540]   on which to hang Mordecai.
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:52.540]   In chapter six, God moves to save the Jews.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:17:00.860]   The king cannot sleep and asked for the record books
[00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.700]   to be read aloud to him.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.580]   Remember I mentioned the record books at the beginning?
[00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:09.340]   The deeds of Mordecai in saving the king
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:11.140]   in the past are read out.
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:16.220]   In this extraordinary change of events,
[00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.860]   the king asked Haman
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.540]   (congregation exclaims)
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.380]   a question.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:27.860]   What should be done to a man who the king wants to honor?
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:35.340]   Haman in his arrogance thinks the king is referring to him
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:40.980]   and advises, oh, I'd put on a lavish display of wealth
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:44.360]   and honor to be bestowed on this person publicly.
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.460]   The king orders Haman
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:54.660]   to do this to Mordecai.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:59.740]   In chapter seven, Esther reveals to the king
[00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.340]   that she is a Jew and that Haman
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.540]   has plotted to kill them all.
[00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:12.540]   Haman is hanged on his own gallows.
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.380]   I think we have a cheer for that one.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:17.700]   (congregation exclaims)
[00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.260]   In chapter eight, nine and 10,
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.260]   all the Jews are saved and Haman's family are killed.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:29.620]   (congregation laughs)
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:34.200]   Wow, are you booing for Haman or booing they were killed?
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.740]   It should be half booing and half cheering really.
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.180]   All I can say is wow.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.480]   It's hard to choose where to read it,
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.940]   which is why I'm saying to you,
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.900]   read it all at home this week.
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:52.140]   I've chosen a few verses from chapter two.
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.740]   I'm gonna read them to you now.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:57.020]   Now there was in the citadel of Susa,
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.740]   a Jew of the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.220]   Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah,
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.260]   whom he had brought up
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:10.540]   because she had neither father or mother.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.480]   This young woman who was also known as Esther
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.260]   had a lovely figure and was beautiful.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.020]   Mordecai had taken her as his own daughter
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.300]   when her father and mother died.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.060]   When the king's order and edict had been proclaimed,
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.620]   many young women were brought to the citadel of Susa
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.680]   and put under the care of Hergai.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.140]   Esther also was taken to the king's palace
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.240]   and entrusted to Hergai, who had charge of the harem.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.440]   She pleased him and won his favor.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.080]   Immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.720]   and special food.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.120]   He assigned to her seven female attendants
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.080]   selected from the king's palace
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.360]   and moved her and her attendants
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.840]   into the best place in the harem.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:06.440]   Esther had not revealed her nationality
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.280]   and family background
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.880]   because Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.500]   Then we move on.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.040]   She was taken to King Xerxes in the royal residence
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.600]   in the 10th month, the month of Tebeth
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.320]   in the seventh year of his reign.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.960]   Now the king was attracted to Esther
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.360]   more than any of the other women,
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.640]   and she won his favor and approval
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.560]   more than any of the other virgins.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.440]   So he set a royal crown on her head
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.360]   and made her queen instead of Vashti.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.920]   And the king gave a great banquet, Esther's banquet,
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.040]   for all his nobles and officials.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.600]   He proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.960]   and distributed gifts with royal liberality.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.040]   When the virgins were assembled a second time,
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.760]   But Esther had kept secret
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.240]   her family background and nationality,
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.200]   just as Mordecai had told her to do so.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.520]   For she continued to follow Mordecai's instructions
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.720]   as she had done when he was bringing her up.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:18.200]   During the time Mordecai was sitting at the king's gate,
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.520]   Bithana and Teresh, two of the king's officers
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.960]   who guided the doorway, became angry
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.800]   and conspired to assassinate King Xerxes.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.320]   But Mordecai found out about the plot
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.960]   and told Queen Esther, who in turn reported it to the king,
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.880]   giving credit to Mordecai.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.440]   And when the report was investigated and found to be true,
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.280]   the two officials were impaled on poles.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.120]   All this was recorded in the book of the annals
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.940]   of the presence of the king.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.760]   Now, why have I chosen these verses?
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.560]   Well, firstly, as I said,
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.720]   the Jews were living in dispersion in Persia.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.440]   A religious minority living at a culture
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.620]   at variance with its values.
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.400]   Can you think of somewhere else like that?
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.880]   21st century Hong Kong.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:24.080]   Hong Kong, less than 10% people who claim to be Christians,
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:29.780]   where our culture is money, power, and position.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:35.020]   How do you do this?
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:40.980]   How do you live in a culture which is at variance
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.200]   to the values that we hold?
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:50.040]   Number one, do you try and withdraw and stay pure?
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.360]   Do you go into lockdown?
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.440]   Do you become monastic?
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.940]   That's not practical.
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:03.140]   Do you try and keep your views private, silent?
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.860]   That's not right.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.140]   Do you criticise everything?
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.540]   Do you protest about everything?
[00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:12.900]   That's not gracious.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:20.600]   Secondly, this was a male dominated society
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   in which a woman becomes a major vehicle for social justice.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.280]   And praise God, in the 21st century,
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:35.040]   we're at long last seeing women raised up as leaders
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:35.880]   around the world.
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.120]   And it's interesting that the countries
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:42.060]   with the best record of COVID-19 have all got women leaders.
[00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:44.260]   I don't know if that's a coincidence or not.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:49.600]   Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson should watch that.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.800]   Thirdly, it teaches us how to follow God
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.800]   in a morally, spiritually, and culturally ambiguous society
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.440]   when you don't know what to do.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.640]   What we're gonna learn this evening is this,
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.400]   is that God is always at work in spite of appearances.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   Secondly, we're gonna learn that for the world,
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.460]   appearances are all that matter.
[00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:27.400]   And thirdly, we're gonna learn how God's work
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.760]   can free us from the world's ways.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.840]   So back to chapter one,
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.680]   King Xerxes has a grand banquet for all the males.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   I guess today we'd call it a stag party.
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.120]   And he gets very drunk.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:45.160]   Verse eight tells us that the party
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.760]   was an all you can drink, a wine buffet.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.880]   At some point, he decides he's gonna show off to the stags
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.560]   the beauty of his queen Vashti.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:02.240]   She gets a summons, come, dress beautifully
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.840]   and stand before thousands of drunken men.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.880]   Would you fancy that?
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:11.920]   Some sources even suggest that she may have been pregnant
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.040]   at the time with Artaxerxes, who was a future king.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:19.520]   But it became a major diplomatic incident,
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.300]   a national crisis.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:28.440]   She showed amazing bravery in a hierarchical society
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.480]   where there was a culture of honour.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:39.160]   She caused the king to lose face.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.380]   Have you heard that expression before?
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:46.080]   Face is a very big thing here in Hong Kong.
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.040]   And the result was she was stripped of her title
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.160]   and she was banished.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.880]   Let's find another queen.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:59.480]   It's a little bit symptomatic of the 21st century,
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.700]   isn't it?
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.480]   Our culture, if one thing doesn't work,
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.440]   we throw it away and get something new.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.880]   Now, Persian kings not only collected vast amounts
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.520]   of jewellery, but also great numbers of women.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.960]   His attendants go and find the most beautiful ladies
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   in the whole empire.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.020]   They bring them all, maybe a thousand,
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:27.280]   and they undergo a complete makeover
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.600]   for one night with the king.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.440]   And there were four possible outcomes.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.040]   Number one, he didn't like them.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.860]   They became concubines, but he never went to them.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:47.660]   But they weren't allowed to go home.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.340]   They weren't allowed to find someone else.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.440]   They were banished to widowhood.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.960]   Number two, he liked them.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:01.060]   They became concubines and he went to them occasionally.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:06.180]   Number three, if you're really lucky,
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.500]   you're in the top three.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:13.580]   He would marry them and their kids would become heirs.
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.340]   And number four, really, really, really, really lucky.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:25.880]   If you were number one, the number one would become queen.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:31.980]   Now, a friend encouraged a Jewish orphan called Esther,
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.780]   brought up by her cousin Mordecai to apply.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:38.580]   Mordecai instructs her to say nothing of her race.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.400]   It would surely ruin her chances.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.500]   So she kept stum.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.760]   She went for beauty treatment and training.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:52.300]   Her turn came eventually for her to visit him.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.700]   And he liked her the best.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.980]   The announcement was made.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.900]   She would become a queen
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.160]   and a big marriage banquet was arranged.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:09.340]   The headline would be something like this.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.980]   I'll put it on the screen.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:15.880]   A little orphan Jewish girl becomes queen
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.540]   of the greatest empire on earth.
[00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:22.960]   But look what the background to all this was.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.100]   The Jews were in great danger.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.200]   They could be taken out at a moment's notice.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.800]   And the story behind Esther is this.
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:38.200]   When God sees this, he always responds dramatically.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.880]   There are many examples of this in scripture.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.680]   The 10 plagues, the pillar of fire,
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.340]   the parting of the Red Sea that we sang about earlier.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:51.080]   As I said, there's no mention of God here.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:56.800]   It has been said that the book of Esther
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.660]   is a record of wonders without a miracle.
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:06.360]   It's obvious here that God's plan unfolded here,
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:10.000]   not by a miracle, a dream or a vision,
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.540]   but by a series of consequences.
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:18.660]   If the king had not got drunk, Vashti stays.
[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.720]   Esther doesn't become queen and save the Jews.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:27.420]   What if Esther wasn't pretty?
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:33.240]   What if Mordecai didn't eavesdrop on two guys
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.000]   who were plotting an assassination of the king?
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.680]   Mordecai wasn't honored at that time,
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:47.600]   but if he was, the Jews wouldn't have been saved.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:51.740]   Instead, his deeds were recorded in a book.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.840]   Store that one for a couple of weeks.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.640]   Ordinary things, not like the 10 plagues
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.280]   or the parting of the Red Sea.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.360]   So for example, Xerxes getting drunk,
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.040]   was it just a coincidence?
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.440]   God was at work.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:18.400]   And God is at work in your life.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:24.340]   His silence is not his absence.
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:28.720]   His hiddenness is not abandonment.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.800]   God doesn't care about appearance.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:43.440]   21st century Hong Kong, we're obsessed with appearance.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:48.200]   The banquet lasted 180 days.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:52.480]   He gets all his treasure paraded before his friends.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.800]   Show off, look what I've got.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.360]   Oh, we can be a bit like that.
[00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.800]   And in chapter two, the scene shifts
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:05.020]   to an international beauty pageant.
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.440]   Miss Universe or Persian Idol, maybe.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:14.400]   In Persian culture, the most important thing about a man
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.120]   was his wealth and power.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.080]   The most important thing about a woman
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.500]   was her sexual and physical beauty.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:27.040]   Aren't you glad we don't live like that?
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.760]   On the surface, we say it's awful
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.200]   that the king had a thousand concubines.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.180]   Disgusting.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.760]   We don't do that now.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:46.840]   Church, it is exactly the same now.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:53.800]   The world is the same today.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.160]   The world is like King Xerxes.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.760]   The world says externals mean more than your character.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.940]   The color of your skin.
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:08.040]   And in Hong Kong, the money in your bank account,
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.220]   the apartment you live in, the car you drive
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:12.400]   is more important than your character.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:21.560]   What you have is more important than who you are.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   We all have to have our own type of beauty treatment.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:33.400]   You go through this and we'll love you.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:38.320]   Hong Kong parents say you get straight A's.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.920]   I'll love you more than if you get C's.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.020]   They may not say that, but they imply that.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:51.160]   Are you a concubine to the world's sexiest man?
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.440]   Are you a concubine to the world's systems
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.360]   and the world's values?
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.440]   Have you sold out to the world's values?
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.320]   Is your choice of career based on,
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.140]   your friendships based on,
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.920]   the way you behave based on the world's values?
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.420]   Don't say, not me.
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.880]   I mean, some people are extreme examples.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.920]   They're easy to spot.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.680]   They're obsessed with these things.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.280]   But make no mistake, the rest of us are affected.
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:31.340]   People in careers that they hate, but they love the status.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.440]   People with eating disorders
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.040]   because every Hollywood idol they see,
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.160]   every model uses an advertisement is a size zero.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.220]   All of us are affected.
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:47.660]   Which leads me to the question,
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.080]   the first two chapters are over.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.880]   How has Esther been doing?
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.200]   What is her midterm report?
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.680]   The answer is she's blown it.
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.440]   When I said the feminists, they're disgusted with Esther.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.100]   They love Vashti.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.440]   She stood up to the chauvinistic king.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.640]   Esther gets there, gets to the top by compliance.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.320]   She listened to Mordecai.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.140]   She's everything that Hergay, the king's unit asked.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.500]   She becomes what we would call today a sex kitten.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.460]   On the other hand,
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:29.640]   evangelicals, conservatives also think she failed.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.460]   They compare her to Daniel and friends.
[00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.620]   They were Jews, but they followed the law.
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:39.180]   Esther doesn't declare her faith.
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.820]   She breaks dietary laws.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.160]   She sleeps with a man that she's not married to.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.700]   She marries an unbeliever.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.300]   Gross violations of biblical law.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:53.260]   But you may be saying, what else could she do?
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:59.440]   It's so much like 21st century Hong Kong.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:04.440]   When we're looking for mates, husband and wives,
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.900]   what's our first cut?
[00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.200]   Our first cut, the world's values.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.680]   Is he or she good looking, good personality, good career?
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.440]   And perhaps financially comfortable?
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:22.360]   And then and only then hope they have character.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.820]   Are we concubines to the world?
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:31.780]   Are we selling ourselves for one night with the king?
[00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.200]   Doing all the Christian stuff, oh yeah.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:37.340]   And what else?
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:41.460]   The truthful answer is yes.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:47.300]   Esther got off to a terrible start.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.940]   Thank goodness this is a four week series,
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.060]   not a one week series.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.660]   You'll see by the end she has a brave heart.
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.740]   God stays with her, grows her, uses her,
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.180]   and makes her into a great woman of God.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:05.200]   Many of us have made a bad start.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.060]   I did.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:12.140]   I wasn't born again until I was 30 years of age.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.740]   Many of us here, even today, feel we've screwed up.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.260]   We can't be used.
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.940]   I've got good news for you.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:28.380]   The message of scripture is not that salvation
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.020]   is for the morally right,
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.760]   those who've led good squeaky clean lives.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.140]   God persistently and consistently gives His grace
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.900]   to those who don't deserve it.
[00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.420]   That's why grace is amazing.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.660]   That's why grace is amazing.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.100]   Man looks at the outward appearance.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:51.460]   God looks at the heart.
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:57.960]   We've got to stop judging the book by the cover.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.420]   I guess I've got to give it a 21st century version.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.500]   We've got to stop judging a book by its Amazon review,
[00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:05.340]   I suppose.
[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:11.160]   When the world says, like Xerxes, I want to be your spouse,
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.660]   when it imposes its conditions,
[00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.340]   I say to you tonight in response to that,
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.580]   God wants to be your spouse.
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:26.660]   What sort of beauty treatment do we need to go through?
[00:37:26.660 --> 00:37:32.160]   Read the Bible cover to cover, pray three hours a day,
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.380]   attend Klan every week, become pastor of the church?
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.520]   No, no, no.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   Listen, Xerxes loved Esther because she was already beautiful.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:52.980]   God loves you to make you beautiful.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:55.760]   Can I say that again?
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.260]   Some people need to hear this.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:02.260]   God loves you to make you beautiful.
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:07.800]   Esther had to give her life and freedom up for a king.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   Jesus Christ, who is a king, is the only spouse
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:17.440]   who gives up his life for you.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:22.560]   By the way, guys, it says in the Bible,
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.680]   we have to love our wives as Jesus Christ loved the church
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.080]   and he gave his life for it.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.400]   He became disfigured.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.840]   He became ugly.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:35.000]   Just watch the Passion of Christ movie.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.140]   He became ugly.
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.420]   To make you beautiful.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:47.660]   In conclusion, there are three things to help you get away
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:52.420]   from the world's concubinage, I don't know if that's
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:55.140]   even a word, concubinage, it sounds a good word.
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:56.840]   Score a lot of words on Scrabble.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:05.840]   Number one is this, get a real definition of beauty.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.240]   Not the world's yardstick.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:15.240]   Real beauty is not self-obsession, but self-sacrifice.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:21.240]   Tell yourself, I am beautiful, he has made me this way.
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:26.800]   Secondly, get a real experience of beauty.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:32.400]   I always get a picture here of the, I do lots of weddings,
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.400]   there's a bride coming down the aisle and when the bride
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.680]   comes down the aisle, I like to watch the bridegroom
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.640]   and watch his face as the bride comes down the aisle.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.200]   That's what your bridegroom, Jesus, thinks of you.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:54.320]   And thirdly, live a life of greatness and live it now.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:01.560]   I am convinced that there are esters in this congregation.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:07.520]   Move on to the future that God has for you.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:14.480]   I declare greatness over you.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.240]   I'm gonna ask you to stand as the band comes back.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.080]   I wanna declare some words over you.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:29.600]   You need to receive this.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.640]   I know you've got used to 20 minute sermons online,
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.040]   this is a bit longer today.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:41.360]   There's a lot in there, but you need to,
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:44.120]   just for the next minute, listen to what I'm gonna say.
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.840]   This is God talking to you.
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:56.440]   Oh yes, I shaped you first inside, then out.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.400]   I formed you in your mother's womb.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:08.360]   Body and soul, you are marvelously made.
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.800]   I know you inside and out.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:15.200]   I know every bone in your body.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.560]   I know exactly how you were made bit by bit,
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.540]   how you were sculpted from nothing into something.
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:28.760]   Like an open book, I watched you grow
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.520]   from conception to birth.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.840]   All the stages of your life were spread out before me.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:38.800]   The days of your life, all prepared
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   before you'd even lived one day.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.760]   I want you to look at the screen now.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.720]   We're gonna make a confession together.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:42:00.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
