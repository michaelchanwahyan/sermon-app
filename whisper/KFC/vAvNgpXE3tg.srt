1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Do you know something?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:15,060
 This is my first live sermon here since November the 26th.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,200
 I'm so pleased that Sandra and I could be back here with our church family.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:25,160
 As I said last week, we've missed you and have been so grateful for your love, your

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,540
 support and your prayers.

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,980
 It's been quite a journey for us.

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,680
 And tonight, we begin another journey together.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:48,140
 One that will take us, as Johnny said, from now until Easter.

9
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:53,580
 Talking of journeys, I heard a story about Albert Einstein, the famous scientist.

10
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,580
 You know, E=mc2.

11
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:04,140
 He was traveling from Princeton, New Jersey on a train when the conductor came down the

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,460
 aisle punching tickets.

13
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,020
 Einstein reached into his vest pocket.

14
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,200
 He couldn't find his ticket.

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,420
 So he reached into his trouser pockets.

16
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,820
 Sounds like me, Sandra, doesn't it?

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,260
 It still wasn't there.

18
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,340
 He looked in his briefcase, but still couldn't find it.

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:32,620
 He looked on the seat next to him, but no sign of the tickets.

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,940
 The conductor was a very kind man.

21
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:42,080
 He said, "Dr. Einstein, I know who you are.

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,780
 We all know who you are.

23
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,860
 I'm sure you bought a ticket.

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,300
 Don't worry about it."

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,500
 The conductor just carried on his way, punching tickets.

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:04,740
 But just before he went to the next car, he turned around and he saw the great scientist

27
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,660
 on his hands and his knees looking for his ticket.

28
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,340
 The conductor rushed back and said, "Dr. Einstein, don't worry.

29
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,100
 I know who you are.

30
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,220
 No problem.

31
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,820
 You don't need a ticket."

32
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:32,860
 Einstein said, "Young man, I too know who I am.

33
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:40,700
 What I don't know is where I'm going."

34
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,220
 I think we all ask ourselves that question, don't we, from time to time?

35
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:51,460
 Where am I going?

36
00:02:51,460 --> 00:03:01,460
 Today we begin a journey, a journey that will last eight weeks and will take us to Easter.

37
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,620
 I mean, we all like journeys, don't we?

38
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,620
 Especially you, Johnny.

39
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,500
 We all like journeys.

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:20,060
 I want to put some photos up of a journey I took to London in 2019.

41
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,660
 As many of you know, I support Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.

42
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,980
 Yes, I know it's sad.

43
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:36,300
 Now thanks to my friends at AIA in Hong Kong, I was able to not only visit the new stadium,

44
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,820
 but actually to go to the training ground to meet the players, including, as you see,

45
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,140
 Harry Kane and Sun Ho Ming.

46
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:54,460
 It was the experience of a lifetime for a lifetime Spurs fan.

47
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:03,620
 But the only way I can share it with you is through social media posts like this.

48
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,220
 You weren't there.

49
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:16,420
 It was a big thrill for me, but I experienced it alone.

50
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:26,860
 But the key to this journey is that we are going on it together.

51
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:35,360
 And experiences always beat those that we do on our own.

52
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,580
 I want to put another picture.

53
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,720
 I want to roll the clock forward a few months.

54
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,340
 A few months after that, a group of us from KFCI went to Israel and Jordan.

55
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,900
 Someone's learned Cantonese at the back.

56
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,380
 Is that the baby speaking Cantonese already?

57
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:06,140
 But the trip here, you will see us outside the empty tomb in Jerusalem.

58
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,220
 It was so special.

59
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,100
 Why?

60
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,420
 Because we did it together.

61
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,460
 We still talk about it now.

62
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,340
 We still ask, when can we go again?

63
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,540
 PS, watch this space.

64
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:37,220
 Indeed, I have to tell you, a few minutes after this picture was taken, we sat around

65
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,500
 and we did communion together.

66
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,340
 A truly shared experience.

67
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:53,020
 And for this one, we are joining hundreds of thousands of Christ followers around the

68
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,160
 globe.

69
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,420
 We will be journeying together.

70
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:05,140
 A small acorn that was birthed here in Hong Kong by a small group of international churches

71
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:12,620
 around five years ago, that has dramatically expanded to the local church, churches of

72
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:20,140
 different denominations, to churches employing various languages, and lastly, geographically,

73
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,860
 to churches across Asia and indeed the world.

74
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:31,420
 I heard that people in 165 countries last year actually took part in some way in the

75
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,420
 One Campaign.

76
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:43,380
 The acorns that were planted have grown into big oak trees.

77
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:50,060
 All inspired by a prayer, all inspired by a prayer that Jesus prayed in John chapter

78
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,220
 17.

79
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,700
 Let me set the scene.

80
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:04,800
 The scene is that Jesus is literally hours before his death.

81
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:16,620
 The cruel barbaric death normally reserved for a common criminal on a dirty wooden cross.

82
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,940
 He prays to his father.

83
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:36,740
 And then in verse 21, he says these words, "That they may all be one, just as you, Father,

84
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:45,700
 are in me and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that

85
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,900
 you have sent me."

86
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,180
 This leads me to a question.

87
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:04,700
 What would you be praying hours before your torture and a painful, bloody death?

88
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,820
 I guess I'd be praying something like, "Couldn't you just dumb down the pain?"

89
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:18,580
 Or maybe, "God, are you sure this is the only way?"

90
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,180
 But Jesus had a different priority.

91
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:30,700
 The unity of his children was the thing that was upper mind in his mind and in his heart.

92
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:37,540
 And that is why we begin this journey today.

93
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:46,940
 I believe that God is saying to his church, "This is a time for building bridges and not

94
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,940
 building walls.

95
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:59,500
 Indeed, it's a time to tear down walls and replace them with bridges."

96
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:08,220
 I believe this congregation is called to be bridge builders.

97
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:18,300
 As a minister for this church, I want to share with you my heart for one church.

98
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:24,580
 The truth is, I've really felt a heavy burden in this area since I started looking at the

99
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,340
 early church in the book of Acts.

100
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,100
 We looked at it last year, do you remember?

101
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:37,020
 I've been comparing the early church in Jerusalem in AD 30 with the early believers sharing

102
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,540
 their possessions, giving to those in needs.

103
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,020
 I see numbers being added daily.

104
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:50,460
 I see miracles happening to such an extent that people wanted to get under Peter's shadow

105
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,540
 that they might be healed.

106
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:06,140
 In Acts 2, verse 1, "At the beginning, when the day of Pentecost came, they were all together

107
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,140
 in one place."

108
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,940
 This is an interesting word, the Greek word for "in one place."

109
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:24,000
 Homophobidon is translated in other versions as "with one accord."

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,340
 They were in the same place spiritually as well as physically.

111
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,300
 What is basically saying today, we know we're all in the same room here today, we're physically

112
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,300
 in one place.

113
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,780
 But are we of one accord?

114
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:51,140
 It means being unanimous, having mutual consent, being in agreement, having group unity, having

115
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:57,060
 one mind and purpose.

116
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:07,080
 Now note, unity is not uniformity.

117
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,100
 We do not have to become like each other.

118
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,460
 Thank goodness.

119
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,060
 There is a richness in diversity.

120
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:24,740
 As I look, I see a richness, I see a diversity in this room.

121
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:34,860
 We're not called to uniformity, but we are called to unity.

122
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,580
 Uniformity is a form of pressure from without.

123
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,820
 We see it in the cults, don't we?

124
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,100
 Where everyone is told, "You've got to be like this.

125
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,380
 You've got to act like this.

126
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,900
 You've got to dress like this," etc.

127
00:11:48,900 --> 00:12:01,660
 But unity, pure unity must come from within and needs grace, the fruit of the Spirit.

128
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:08,180
 I need to tell you right now, if we're going to preserve the unity of the Spirit, we must

129
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,180
 possess the necessary spiritual graces.

130
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:16,620
 We can look either to the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5, but the fruit of the Spirit

131
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:23,580
 is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.

132
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:30,380
 Or to the list that Paul has kindly included in the fourth chapter of his letter to the

133
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,580
 Ephesians.

134
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:38,620
 He says this, "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy

135
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:47,300
 of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness and patience,

136
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,060
 bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond

137
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,340
 of peace."

138
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:05,100
 If one and the one campaign is going to move beyond a Lent Bible plan, we're not just looking

139
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,940
 for a Lent Bible plan.

140
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,340
 We don't want in 40 days time, go back to the way we were.

141
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,500
 This is what we need.

142
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,500
 Paul tells us seven things, humility, gentleness, patience, forbearing.

143
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:28,500
 He says, "Bearing with one another in love, love, eagerness to maintain unity and peace."

144
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,660
 That's our job description.

145
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,140
 And Paul seems to sum it up very well in Colossians 3.15.

146
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,580
 I've put it on the screen.

147
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:45,560
 It says, "And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you are called

148
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,180
 in one body."

149
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:53,500
 I think this verse says it all.

150
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:00,700
 Now it's true that we will not agree on everything.

151
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:07,020
 We don't want to be a church where we agree on everything.

152
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:17,380
 But it's essential that we do agree on foundational truths.

153
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:25,340
 And dear Paul helps us again by listing seven, that number again, in verses four to six.

154
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:31,380
 "There is one body and one spirit, just as you are called to one hope that belongs to

155
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:38,140
 your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all

156
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,020
 and through all and in all."

157
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,180
 As an aside, he seems to be promoting the one campaign, doesn't he?

158
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:58,420
 He talks about one body, one spirit, one hope in our calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism,

159
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,900
 one God and Father.

160
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:09,060
 My friends, seven essential things that we are to agree on.

161
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:17,180
 Paul is concerned that we do not break the spirit of unity by agreeing to false teaching.

162
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,900
 He does not recommend peace at any price.

163
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:29,940
 On the other hand, purity of teaching itself does not produce spiritual unity, which is

164
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,740
 why Paul joins the two in verse 15.

165
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,020
 I love this.

166
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:41,140
 Ephesians 4.15, "Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into

167
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,100
 Him who is the head into Christ."

168
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,780
 We found the answer.

169
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,820
 Don't you just love the Word of God?

170
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:57,860
 The key to keeping the unity of spirit, the key to ensuring this is not just a great Lent

171
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:04,300
 program, but a continuing work of God in our city.

172
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,980
 The truth in love.

173
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,140
 In love.

174
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,980
 The truth.

175
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:24,260
 Let us pray that this will be the 2023 reality in Hong Kong and the Christian church as a

176
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,260
 whole.

177
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:34,020
 Then I believe we will start to see things that not only match, but would surpass the

178
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:40,980
 early church in Acts 30, that we would truly be one.

179
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,100
 And God has laid on our hearts in conjunction with all the other churches taking part in

180
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:54,420
 the One Campaign, an even bigger, some might say audacious vision.

181
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
 We call it the 2033.

182
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,420
 Sorry, that's the 2033.

183
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,420
 We've got the date wrong there.

184
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,460
 2033 vision.

185
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:11,860
 Every tribe, every tongue, every nation.

186
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,460
 Every tribe, every tongue, every nation.

187
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,540
 Here's some staggering facts.

188
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:27,340
 Earth's population numbers are in the billions and it's growing every day.

189
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:34,500
 There are over 7,100 languages spoken all over the world.

190
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:45,860
 70% of people alive today primarily learn through audible communication and 50% cannot

191
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,420
 read at a functional level.

192
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:57,220
 How will they ever come to hear the gospel?

193
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:04,020
 Faith Comes By Hearing, who are sponsoring the One Campaign, have come alongside the worldwide

194
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:12,860
 translation community in a movement to finish the task, to ensure that everyone on earth

195
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:19,860
 has access to Jesus Christ's gospel in a format they can understand.

196
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:27,180
 The goal is to see the Word of God recorded and freely provided in every language that

197
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:33,020
 needs it by the year 2033.

198
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,340
 My friends, this is it.

199
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,380
 The final sprint.

200
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:47,380
 The great commission fulfilled in our generation.

201
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,220
 Hear the words of Jesus.

202
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,300
 These are not my words, Matthew 24, 14.

203
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:58,580
 And the gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony

204
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,580
 to all nations.

205
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,620
 Now that word nations actually in Greek is ethnos, which actually means ethnic groups.

206
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:11,720
 It means the geographical countries that we see today will be as a testimony to all people

207
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,540
 groups and then the end will come.

208
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:19,740
 Jesus will come again.

209
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,580
 I hope I've got you excited about our journey.

210
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,500
 But you may be asking, how are we going to start?

211
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,540
 Well from Ash Wednesday, this Wednesday, the 22nd of February until Easter Sunday, the

212
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:48,580
 9th of April, we will be joining Christians across the globe, listening to Luke's gospel.

213
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:54,340
 To do so, you'll need to download the free app that Johnny mentioned, One Hearing the

214
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,220
 Word.

215
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,740
 Every day you'll be able to listen to a passage from Luke's gospel.

216
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,420
 It will only be a few minutes.

217
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,900
 There'll be a daily devotional that's been written by a pastor here in Hong Kong.

218
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,180
 And there will be a prayer actually that I wrote.

219
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:22,100
 Then each weekend we'll have the opportunity to watch a gospel film.

220
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:31,540
 And here at church, we will be listening to a sermon based on the parables of Jesus in

221
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,380
 Luke.

222
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,740
 This is what you can look forward to.

223
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,700
 I've put it up there now.

224
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,820
 So if you want to know what we're going to be hearing and who you're going to be hearing

225
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:48,260
 it from the next few weeks, these are the sermons for the next eight weeks.

226
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:54,900
 And next week, Johnny will be bringing us the parable of the Good Samaritan.

227
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:03,380
 And you've heard that this year we are introducing One Pray for Five with a vision that every

228
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:09,820
 person in the world will be prayed for by 2033.

229
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:17,300
 And how it starts is you and I writing down the names today of five people, pre-believers

230
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,700
 that you are going to pray for.

231
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,980
 And we believe the power of mathematics is that that happens for the whole world will

232
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,940
 be covered in prayer in 10 years.

233
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:39,260
 Let me just take a few moments to give you some background to the parables of Jesus.

234
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:47,460
 Jesus told parables to help his audience imagine a reality other than the one they were used

235
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:55,980
 to and to respond to it by having a change of heart and seeking a closer relationship

236
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,060
 with God.

237
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:05,360
 That reality is what we call the kingdom of heaven.

238
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,980
 The gospel of Luke contains both the largest total number of parables.

239
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,180
 There are 24 parables in the gospel of Luke.

240
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:20,980
 And there are 18 parables in Luke's gospel which are unique to Luke's gospel.

241
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,320
 They are not found in the other three gospels.

242
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:33,440
 It is helpful for us to see how parables function in Luke's gospel.

243
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,580
 But before we do that, let's take a step backwards.

244
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:46,020
 What kind of speech is meant when we use the term parable?

245
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:56,780
 A parable is a short story that refers to something outside the parable itself.

246
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:05,180
 Jesus' parables, especially in the gospel of Luke, refer to the kingdom of God.

247
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:11,460
 The English term parable comes from a Greek term, parabolē, but the Greek term has a

248
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:21,380
 somewhat broader range of meaning and includes, for example, what we often call riddles.

249
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:29,620
 Although parables are related to other kinds of speech like riddles and proverbs, parables

250
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,980
 emphasize story.

251
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:39,040
 You're going to be hearing seven stories over the next seven weeks.

252
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:47,960
 Parables are short stories that refer to God's realm of power, God's kingdom.

253
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,500
 In Luke's gospel, as well as the gospels of Matthew and Mark, Jesus' parables generally

254
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,840
 have a very familiar setting.

255
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,020
 But these little stories also usually have some surprising element that turns the familiar

256
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,460
 world upside down.

257
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:18,600
 During Jesus' time on earth, he loved using profound parables to teach important lessons.

258
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:29,440
 There's currently a modern day parable circling across the internet in which a wealthy father

259
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,320
 takes his son to a poor farm in the country with the intention of teaching his son to

260
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,580
 value their wealth.

261
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:48,080
 But to his surprise, his son's eye-opening response to this exercise turns the tables

262
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,820
 completely.

263
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,560
 It goes like this.

264
00:24:52,560 --> 00:25:01,600
 One day, a very wealthy father took his son on a trip to the country for the sole purpose

265
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,000
 of showing his son how it was to be poor.

266
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,760
 They spent a few days and nights on a farm of what would be considered a very poor family.

267
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,040
 After their return from the trip, the father asked his son how he liked the trip.

268
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,200
 It was great, dad.

269
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,280
 The son replied, did you see how poor people can be?

270
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,640
 Oh, yes, said the son.

271
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,400
 So what did you learn from the trip?

272
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,040
 Asked the father.

273
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:46,600
 The son said, I saw that we have one dog and they have four.

274
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:53,480
 We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has

275
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,720
 no end.

276
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:03,880
 We have imported lanterns in our garden, probably from Ikea, and they have stars at night.

277
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:12,400
 Our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon.

278
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:22,180
 We have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our sight.

279
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:29,960
 We have servants who serve us, but they serve others.

280
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:35,280
 We buy our food, but they grow theirs.

281
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:44,040
 We have walls around our property to protect us, but they have friends to protect them.

282
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,720
 The boy's father was speechless.

283
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:59,700
 And his son said to him, dad, it showed me how poor we really are.

284
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,000
 Very poignant.

285
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,260
 In that same frame of mind, we are going to be looking together at the good Samaritan.

286
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:20,620
 The rich fool, the unjust steward, the rich man and Lazarus, the Pharisee and the tax

287
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,580
 collector and the tenants.

288
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,860
 We could equally have looked at some other parables in Luke.

289
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:35,420
 But we need to ask ourselves the question as we prepare for it.

290
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:44,620
 What do the parables teach us about living in the kingdom of heaven?

291
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:51,740
 And perhaps more importantly, and week by week, I want you to ask yourself these questions.

292
00:27:51,740 --> 00:28:04,700
 What sort of changes do you or do we personally need to make in order to live in God's reign?

293
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,200
 Jesus told parables.

294
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,540
 He didn't write them down to be read.

295
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:25,080
 His message spread by word of mouth when his disciples told the stories.

296
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:34,300
 I want to pray right now as we finish that we would offer our mouth.

297
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:48,860
 We offer our mouth to the Lord to be used to take his message to the ends of the earth.

298
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,340
 Would we stand as the band comes back?

299
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:56,340
 I'd love to pray for us.

300
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:18,820
 I'm going to ask you a question as we close tonight.

301
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:31,180
 Are you willing to dedicate your mouth to be used as God would deign to use you to tell

302
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:40,780
 the stories of Jesus and his kingdom to the ends of the earth?

303
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:45,580
 I believe this is not about a preacher or a church.

304
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,620
 It's about the mobilization.

305
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,500
 There are going to be hundreds of thousands of Christians on this journey with us over

306
00:29:52,500 --> 00:30:01,420
 Lent if each one of us would dedicate our mouth to him to be used.

307
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,140
 We're going to be singing together in a moment.

308
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:10,780
 Let it be today we sing a song of heaven.

309
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,620
 Glory to our God.

310
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,780
 Let's pray.

311
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,900
 Maybe you want to put your hands on your mouth.

312
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:32,020
 Say Lord I offer you my lips.

313
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,380
 We thank you Lord.

314
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:39,740
 You've given us this vision.

315
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:50,420
 The gospel will go to the ends of the earth.

316
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,460
 Maybe you're not be like that father who took his son to the country.

317
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:01,420
 Be trapped by the things of the world and the values of the world.

318
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:07,780
 Maybe you'd be like that little boy.

319
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:16,420
 Maybe we see the kingdom of God in the things that surround us.

320
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,580
 We pray today for the five people Lord that we're going to put the names down of and as

321
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,860
 we pray for them daily Lord.

322
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,760
 We pray for salvation.

323
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:35,180
 We pray for restoration.

324
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:41,180
 I want to pray for the churches of Hong Kong.

325
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,220
 We pray for every church in this city Lord.

326
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:51,020
 Pray for every pastor every leader.

327
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:56,260
 Help us Lord to see them as brothers and sisters.

328
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:01,260
 Help us Lord to join hands with them.

329
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,460
 Because there will be a day Lord.

330
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,700
 When we stand together before the throne of God.

331
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,580
 Arm in arm.

332
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:18,540
 We sing this song of heaven.

333
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:23,420
 Glory to our God who sits on the throne.

334

 Holy is the lamb.

 Let's not wait Lord till we're in heaven.

 As we say glory to God.
