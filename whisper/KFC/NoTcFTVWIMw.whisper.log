[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.840]   We are almost finished our current series on equipping the saints and serving the community.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.280]   And we started off together, literally together.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.680]   The first sermon was with Pastor Seth and talking about unity.
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.540]   And did a great job talking about why we need to be as a body of Christ, working together.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.760]   And then we had a sermon on being prepared.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.640]   How Jesus himself was prepared in the desert through the three temptations.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.480]   Last week Pastor John talked to us about being equipped.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.280]   He talked about ways that we are equipped.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.400]   The first is the how, then it's the why and it's the where.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.080]   Holy Spirit equips each one of us in the body of Christ with different gifts.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.440]   He equips us so that we can build up the body of Christ together so that the kingdom of
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.560]   heaven will be built up.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.440]   So together, prepared, equipped.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.600]   And finally today we are talking about witness.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.760]   Has anybody been to Cleveland before?
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.180]   Now I've heard weird things about Cleveland.
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.000]   It's not very pretty, but there's one really quite famous thing in the city of Cleveland.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.940]   When he was playing there, there was this really huge poster there or banner, whatever
[00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:43.940]   you call it.
[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.240]   Let's show it there.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.480]   It's LeBron James, we are all witnesses.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.720]   And Nike came up with this commercial, we are all witnesses.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.080]   What are we witnessing?
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.320]   LeBron James.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.760]   And it's been 20 years that he's been playing.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.720]   Man, these old guys are playing so well, right?
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.160]   Tom Brady just retired.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.960]   You know, Nadal is still going, sort of.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.680]   Djokovic is still going.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.160]   All these guys, so old.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.840]   Well, not old, a little bit younger than some of us, mature, but still going.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.640]   Old in terms of athletic age, but still going.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:34.200]   LeBron James, 38 years old, still going, still MVP, still getting the most votes in the NBA.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.120]   Amazing how he has kept his body just in prime condition.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.960]   We are witnessing these great athletes.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.040]   And Jesus also tells us that we need to witness.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.240]   What is a witness?
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.920]   Well, according to some internet definitions, a witness is a person who sees an event happening,
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.120]   especially a crime or an accident, and he testifies to it, right?
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.120]   So in court, somebody is a witness, comes up and testify what he or she has heard or
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   seen.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.600]   He is a witness.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.880]   And we see continuously in the scriptures that Jesus tells us that we need to be witnesses.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.600]   And so we see this, firstly, when Jesus says the Great Commission.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.960]   Let's read together, all authority, one, two, three.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.000]   All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.360]   Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.880]   of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I've commanded you.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.120]   And surely I'm with you always to the very end of the age.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.760]   Jesus says, all authority has been given to me, so go and make disciples.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.040]   Go and share the message that I have taught you.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.120]   Go and make disciples how I have made a disciple out of you.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.840]   And when Jesus died and rose again, before he was going to be raised, he told us in Acts,
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.640]   let's read together in the book of Acts, one, two, three, that you will receive power when
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.560]   the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea,
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.520]   in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.880]   Jesus is saying the Holy Spirit will come.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.040]   And when that happens, you will be my witnesses.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:46.400]   You will tell of the things you have learned, seen, experienced, and you will be my witnesses,
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:55.040]   not only in your city, Jerusalem, but in your neighboring province in Judea, to foreign
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:03.640]   sort of regions in Samaria, and then to the ends of the earth, to the ends of the earth.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:11.240]   And in 1 Peter, it also says this, but in your hearts, revere Christ as Lord.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.040]   Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.040]   that you have.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.880]   But do this with gentleness and respect.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:34.120]   Be prepared in season, out of season, to share what the Lord has done for you.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.160]   And we're going to learn about witness today, and the best person that we can learn from
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.400]   is Jesus himself.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.840]   And so we're going to see a quick video on this.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:06:00.680]   Would you give me a drink?
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.520]   Did you hear me?
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.520]   That's bad, huh?
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.960]   What?
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:17.040]   You would you ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan, and a woman?
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.960]   I should have said please.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.560]   You know, it's not safe for you to be alone out here.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.560]   Nor you.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.240]   Why haven't you come with others?
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.440]   Why so late in the day?
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.440]   Don't women come to the wells in the cool of the morning?
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.320]   Yeah, well, none of them will be seen with me, so I have to come out now.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.000]   In the heat, as you have so kindly reminded me.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.400]   Why won't they be seen with you?
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.400]   Long story.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.400]   I'd still like a drink of water, if you can spare it.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.960]   You've seen what a parched throat will do.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.920]   Aren't I unclean to you?
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:06.120]   Won't you be defiled by this vessel?
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.240]   Maybe some of my people say that about your women, but I don't.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   Yeah?
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.960]   And what do you say?
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   I say if you knew who I am, you'd be asking me for a drink.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.960]   Really?
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.960]   And I would give you living water.
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.560]   Would, except that you have nothing to draw water with, and this is a deep well.
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:34.480]   Besides, what do you need from me if you have your own supply of living water?
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.480]   Long story.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.040]   Your water is better than Samaritan water.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.040]   That's not what I said.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.120]   Are you a better man than our ancestor Jacob, who dug this well?
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.400]   Your water is better than his?
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:51.360]   I know Jacob, and everyone who drinks this water will thirst again.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.400]   But whoever drinks the water that I give him will never be thirsty again.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.760]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:06.760]   The water I give will become in a person a spring of water, welling up to eternal life.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.760]   Really?
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:08.760]   Yes, really.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.760]   Prove it.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:18.120]   First, go and call your husband and come back.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120]   I will show you both.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120]   I don't have a husband.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.120]   You are right.
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.400]   You've had five husbands.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.040]   And the man you're living with now is not your husband.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.440]   I see.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.840]   You're a prophet.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   You're here to preach at me.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   No.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.760]   Usually the one good thing about coming here alone is I can escape being condemned.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.920]   I'm not here to condemn you.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   I've made mistakes.
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.920]   Too many.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.440]   But it's men like you who have made it impossible for me to do anything about it.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.440]   How?
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.720]   My ancestors worshipped on this mountain.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.160]   But you Jews insist Jerusalem is the only place for true worship.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.040]   They say that because the temple is there.
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.320]   Exactly where we're not allowed.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.600]   I'm here to break those barriers.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.200]   And the time is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   the Father.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.080]   So where am I supposed to go when I need God?
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.520]   I've never received anything from God, but I couldn't thank him even if I did.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.960]   Anywhere.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:26.960]   God is spirit.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:33.800]   And the time is coming and is now here that it won't matter where you worship, but only
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.000]   that you do it in spirit and truth.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Heart and mind.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.600]   That, that is the kind of worshipper he's looking for.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:59.800]   It won't matter where you're from or what you've done.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.960]   That clip was taken from The Chosen.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.040]   And anybody been watching The Chosen?
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.700]   It's a new sort of film or TV series about Jesus.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:17.680]   And it sort of uses sort of the message, you know, translation sort of version to modernize
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.240]   what they could have had a conversation about.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:29.280]   And so here we see Jesus and the Samaritan woman.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.920]   And Jesus had so many difficulties in relating with this woman.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.600]   Firstly, Jesus was a Jew.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.020]   And we see in the video, why are you talking with me?
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.020]   You are a Jew.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.060]   I'm a Samaritan woman.
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:53.540]   There were cultural barriers between Jews and Gentiles.
[00:10:53.540 --> 00:11:03.700]   We'll see in the map next slide that Samaria was in the middle, right?
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:10.180]   And Jesus is in Judea in the bottom part, and he's going to Galilee.
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:17.220]   And the Jews disliked the Samaritans so much that they would actually cross over to the
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:22.380]   Jordan River to not go through Samaria.
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.980]   And that's because Samaritans were considered half-breeds, unclean.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.100]   You remember in the video, you want a drink of water from me?
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.420]   A Samaritan?
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.940]   Isn't our water not as good as your water?
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.940]   It's in it unclean.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.540]   My vessel is unclean.
[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:45.100]   The Samaritans were considered half-breeds.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:52.380]   When the Assyrians came and overtook the Jews, they intermingled, interbred with some of
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.860]   the Jews.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:58.620]   And those became the Samaritans.
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:07.900]   And so the Jews and the Samaritans had cultural differences, and that became a barrier for
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.740]   them to talk.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:12.680]   And also, Jesus was a man, right?
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.940]   And so not just any man, he was a righteous man, considered a prophet.
[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:23.700]   And she, as you see in the video, she was considered sort of an outcast.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.300]   She went to the well at noon.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.400]   Why did she go to the well at noon?
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.540]   To be alone.
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.580]   Possibly because she didn't want to be with anybody.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:39.080]   Maybe she was the talk of the town because she had five husbands.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:45.420]   She had five husbands.
[00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.300]   And there was also a religious difference.
[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:54.700]   The Jews thought that they worshipped in the proper area, the right place.
[00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.620]   And where was that?
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.220]   Jerusalem.
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:04.940]   And you see in the next slide that the Samaritans worshipped on Mount Gerizim, right?
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:15.020]   That was where their ancestors worshipped in the Old Testament.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.980]   As it says, that you will worship me when you leave on Mount Gerizim.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:29.620]   And so there were differences, cultural differences, gender differences, social differences, religious
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.740]   differences.
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.700]   And yet Jesus chose to connect with this woman.
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:42.520]   And so we're going to learn five ways we can witness like Jesus.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:48.840]   On a scale of one to 10, how easy was it for Jesus to connect with this woman?
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.580]   It was super hard, right?
[00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:59.100]   Sometimes there are super easy people, right, that are so willing to know more about God,
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.100]   right?
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.620]   And those people, you just share the gospel with them and they come to know Jesus.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:11.380]   But this one, between Jesus and the Samaritan woman, it's one of the hardest because of
[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.560]   all these barriers.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:19.600]   And we're going to learn five ways to witness like Jesus.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.360]   And first is choose, choose.
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:31.800]   Jesus chose especially to have a divine appointment with this woman.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:39.520]   Jesus could have went around Samaria like most Jews, but he chose to meet this woman
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.160]   directly.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:50.280]   And we also, in order for us to witness like Jesus, we need to choose to see the people
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.880]   around us.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:58.080]   Choose to meet with the people around us.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:06.040]   Choose to get to know the people around us, to see that they also need the Lord.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.000]   We need to choose.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.240]   In your sphere of relationships, right, you can have your family as the closest, you know,
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.240]   best friends.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.720]   And then you have sort of your friends, right?
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.120]   Maybe not Facebook friends.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.560]   Are they real friends?
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.320]   Okay, friends.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.600]   And then Facebook friends.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   And then acquaintances, people you just say hi and bye to.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.640]   And then after that, you know, coworkers, right?
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.280]   Or coworkers or acquaintances, something like that, or friends, they become friends as well.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.840]   But in our sphere of relationships, do we choose to be intentional?
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.680]   Jesus is intentional with this woman.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.800]   He wanted to meet with her personally.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:02.720]   In our sphere of relationships, in the family, relatives, close friends, friends, acquaintances,
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:12.280]   coworkers, are we choosing to be intentional with our relationships?
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:18.360]   The second thing is to witness like Jesus, we need to connect with people.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.360]   Connect.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.800]   How did Jesus connect with this woman?
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.400]   Water.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.200]   Can I have a drink?
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.240]   Right?
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:30.720]   And then he mentions it again.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:36.400]   If you want water, if you know who is asking you for water, you would have asked me for
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:41.840]   water and I would have given you living water.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.480]   Right?
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:50.160]   Jesus answered her, if you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:57.360]   you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.560]   The woman was drawing water.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.480]   Jesus asked for water.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:07.720]   The Samaritan was like, why are you asking me for water?
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.240]   Jesus is like, do you know who is asking you for water?
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.800]   This water theme comes up continually.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:25.200]   And if we are to witness to our friends, family, relatives, coworkers, acquaintances, we need
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.200]   to connect with them.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.800]   And so how do you connect with them?
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.680]   Maybe you go rock climbing together.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.160]   Maybe you go playing tennis together.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.560]   Maybe you...
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.320]   It's a sensitive topic in the church, you know.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:48.160]   Play games, board games together.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.000]   Play games together.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.480]   Have dinner together.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.000]   Play basketball together.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.920]   Go watch some movies together.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.520]   You need to connect with people.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.720]   Jesus connected with this woman.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:08.120]   We need to also connect with our friends and our family.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.400]   And it's not that hard.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   You just need to find things that you commonly like.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   What do you like?
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.440]   Oh, I like to eat.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.160]   Who likes to eat?
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.080]   Well then we can connect.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.080]   Let's connect.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.880]   Right?
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.640]   If you like specific foods, then you can go and connect together, eat together.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:33.040]   And through that, you can build trust.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.160]   So choose to be intentional.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:43.360]   You need to connect through some sort of common interest or theme or something you like.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.760]   And then the next thing we need to start doing is we need to care.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.240]   What do we need to care for?
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.040]   What did Jesus care about?
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:56.480]   Jesus cared about her spiritual background.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.520]   She pointed out specifically, "Oh, you worship.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.720]   You Jews worship there.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.760]   We worship here.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.680]   We're not allowed in Jerusalem because we're considered unclean."
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:19.440]   And then Jesus responds again, right, and says that, "You will neither worship here
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.880]   or there, but one day you'll worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.600]   And that time is now."
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:37.560]   As we connect with our friends, we can start to care more about them, care for them.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:43.040]   Have you tried connecting with your friends and seeing what their spiritual background
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.760]   is?
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:52.320]   Whether they believe in God or not, whether they go to church or not.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:59.640]   Maybe they've been to church in the past, but now how do they feel about church?
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.760]   Maybe they have a bad experience at church and you can care for them.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.920]   How come you had a bad experience?
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.360]   How can I help you make...
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:16.960]   Find what you went through, spiritual background.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:22.480]   And eventually we need to care about their spiritual need.
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.920]   Every one of us has a need.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.360]   What was the woman's need?
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.920]   So she was dancing around, playing with water.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.400]   She was dancing around this religion issue.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.720]   But what was really her need?
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   What do you think was her need?
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.720]   Shout it out.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.720]   What do you think was her real need?
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   Pardon me?
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   Love?
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.280]   Understanding?
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.760]   Maybe attention, somebody to actually speak with her?
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.720]   Not acceptance?
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.880]   She desired relationship.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.640]   She'd been with five husbands.
[00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.480]   She's gone through relationship after relationship after relationship.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:24.660]   Her deepest need was acceptance and relationship, love, all this.
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.040]   And she'd been trying through relationship, relationship, relationship, and it's left
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.680]   her empty.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:40.800]   And Jesus points her towards a relationship that will last forever.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:46.400]   And that is a relationship with God, with himself.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:52.240]   And the next thing we need to know is how to be clever.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.000]   Now Jesus, obviously, he's all-knowing, all-powerful.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.560]   He's the smartest person in the world.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.580]   He was clever.
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:05.960]   And when we are witnesses, we ourselves also need to be clever.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:14.080]   We need to be clever because relationships are so sensitive.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.320]   They're so sensitive.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.720]   You can say one thing and destroy the relationship.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:28.320]   James warned us, "Be careful of your tongue because your tongue is like a flaming fireball."
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.460]   Flaming fireball.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:32.480]   Anything you can say can destroy the relationship.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.280]   We need to be smart.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:42.440]   If we're too pushy, we're going to seem as too pushy, right?
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:55.360]   If we're too pushy, then we're going to put off people from Jesus.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.380]   If we keep shoving religion down people's throat, we're going to choke the people, right?
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.120]   They're not going to want to know more about Jesus.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.760]   They're going to be turned off about Jesus.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:15.660]   And so what we need to know is to be sensitive to the Spirit's guidance.
[00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:21.540]   There are times where somebody is really ready for the gospel and you just go and share the
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.780]   gospel with that person and they can come to know Jesus.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:32.740]   But there are times where some people need more time.
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:40.780]   Maybe they need to work out some of their spiritual issues, some philosophical, theological
[00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:41.780]   issues.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.060]   Maybe they don't believe in God yet and we need to work out some of these theological
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.060]   issues with them.
[00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.940]   Maybe they have issues surrounded about morality.
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.360]   Why does God allow evil and suffering?
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.020]   Maybe they've had some past hurts in the church and they need to experience more of the love
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.400]   of God first.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:07.360]   And so sometimes it requires more time.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.440]   It's like going apple picking.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.540]   Have anybody gone apple picking before?
[00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.540]   Yeah?
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:13.820]   It's quite popular in Toronto, actually.
[00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.660]   You can just go to the apple farm and go pick the fruit.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:22.500]   And so what do you usually do at the apple farm?
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.340]   You go and pick apples and then you eat them.
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.100]   Where do you usually pick?
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:29.300]   Where do you usually pick, Anthony?
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.180]   Yeah, in an apple tree.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.460]   Which apples do you usually eat?
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.220]   So you're looking at a big apple tree.
[00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:36.620]   Which apples do you usually pick?
[00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:41.180]   Do you climb up to the top and then pick the ones at the top?
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.180]   No.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.180]   And then climb down?
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.180]   No.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:45.180]   You pick the easier ones.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:46.900]   It's easy pickings.
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:53.740]   So we need to identify as witnesses what people are ready for the gospel.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.820]   What fruits are ripe for the picking.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:03.580]   If we're picking Royal Gala apples or Red Delicious, you don't pick the green ones if
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.820]   you're Red Delicious.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:11.020]   You pick the red ripe ones, like the color of your chair.
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.980]   Because you know they're ripe for the picking.
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:20.060]   And in the same way, we need to be sensitive to the Spirit to recognize where our friends
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:27.940]   are at spiritually so that we can lead them one step closer to Jesus.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:33.780]   Our goal is that every time we encounter our friends and our family, that we lead them
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:39.740]   one step closer towards Christ.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.740]   And the fifth thing is Christ.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:48.780]   If we are friends with our, if we keep playing basketball, if we keep playing board games,
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:56.860]   if we keep playing tennis with these people, but we never lead them towards Christ or share
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:01.220]   Christ, we're no different than the world.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:03.340]   We're no different than the world.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.860]   Actually the world is better at being friends than us.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:13.140]   The world is, there's some amazing people out there that are caring and loving, but
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.940]   they don't know Christ, but they're amazing friends.
[00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:25.460]   The difference for us being witnesses is that eventually people need to see Christ in us,
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:32.600]   whether it's through our love, through our actions, and eventually through our words.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:40.700]   We can share our story, how God has changed us, how he has worked in and through our life,
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:47.020]   how he has saved us, and share that story with them.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.100]   And so the next slide, you'll see this diagram.
[00:26:50.100 --> 00:27:01.340]   Yes, our goal as Christians, as witnesses, is that we want to lead our friends, family,
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:06.460]   relatives, coworkers, one step closer towards Jesus Christ.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.140]   Every time we meet them, we're hoping.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:16.380]   So maybe we have friends that are without Christ, and they're so far from Christ, right?
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:23.780]   They're like anti-God, they're like anti-church, anti-Christian, but somehow they know you,
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.260]   and they like you, and they start eating out with you.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.820]   And so they're here.
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:34.140]   And so every time you have dinner with them, hopefully, oh, they see, oh, they're at one,
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:39.300]   and they're, oh, they have dinner with you, and they're, oh, he's not a bad guy, Anthony.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.060]   They become at two.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:45.180]   And he's like, oh, yeah, he actually cares about me, three, right?
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:50.780]   And then they become closer to this point, let's say it's number five, a point where
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:58.460]   they're ready to be open towards knowing more about Jesus, and to the point where they're
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:04.780]   willing to even enter into a relationship with Jesus, accepting Christ, right?
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:09.180]   And once they've accepted Christ, this is where they're at the church, and we keep helping
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:17.940]   them to become mature Christians, leading them to know God, and becoming more like God.
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:25.540]   And so we see here, in the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman, that Jesus reveals
[00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.300]   himself.
[00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:32.440]   And he says this, actually, let's read John chapter four, 25 to 26.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.000]   The woman said, "I know the Messiah called Christ is coming.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.600]   When he comes, he will explain everything to us.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:46.760]   Then Jesus declared, 'I, the one speaking to you, I am he.'"
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:55.360]   How many times in the New Testament do we see that Jesus so clearly reveals his identity?
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:00.040]   Is it every day on Instagram, he's like, yo, here I am, this is what I'm doing, this is
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.360]   who I am, come follow me on Instagram.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.560]   Does he say that?
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.560]   No.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.400]   He's actually very subtle.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.760]   He might probably not have Instagram if he was alive today.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.760]   He'd be very subtle.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:20.080]   Maybe it was a very private, to 12 disciples, Instagram page, right?
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:29.680]   But Jesus chooses to reveal himself, that he is the Christ.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:39.600]   And we as his witnesses, we also need to reveal to our friends and our family, acquaintances,
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.000]   that we are followers of Christ.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.440]   We need to choose to connect with our friends and family intentionally.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:51.160]   We need to connect with them.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:57.240]   We need to care about them, their spiritual background, their spiritual need.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:02.160]   We need to be clever to understand the timing that God has.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.360]   God has the perfect timing.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:12.200]   And eventually, we need to lead them towards Christ.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.240]   I was playing basketball, obviously.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   And I was playing basketball, and I met a friend, I met a guy named Jonah.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.160]   And this was like a year and a half ago, I think.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.440]   And actually, we weren't friends.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.240]   I was friends with his friend, and his friend brought him to play basketball with us.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:40.320]   And I quickly learned more about Jonah, that he actually went to Confucius High School,
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.840]   which is actually in Causeway Bay.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.080]   And we started playing ball more and more together.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:55.480]   And I realized that he was actually quite open towards knowing more about spiritual
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.480]   things.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:03.920]   Actually, he liked Confucianism so much that he took a personal private class every week
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.920]   to learn and study Confucius text.
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:14.680]   So then I'm like, "Oh, if you're interested in Confucius text, maybe you would be interested
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   in learning about the Bible as well."
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:26.120]   And so I invited him to start coming to our fellowship on Thursdays.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:34.480]   And so this no-religion kind of person who likes to know more about Confucianism and
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:41.240]   Buddhist texts and Confucius texts started coming to our fellowship regularly.
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.320]   And he started coming for several months, actually.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.440]   And he even came to one of our summer camps.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:54.120]   So I was playing basketball with him one day, and then we had dinner.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.680]   And he was like, "Oh, what are you doing tomorrow?"
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.320]   I said, "I'm going to camp.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.520]   I'm going to one of our Explorer camps."
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:05.280]   Explorer is the name of our youth program.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.440]   And he's like, "Cool."
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.540]   And I'm like, "Do you wanna come?"
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:10.640]   And he's like, "Yeah, sure.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.320]   I'll ask my parents right now."
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.480]   So I call Carmen, who is in charge of the camp.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.480]   I was like, "Yo, I have this high school student.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.320]   He wants to come to our youth camp.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:21.360]   He's non-Christian, and it's awesome.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.360]   It's perfect.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:30.680]   He can come, and this is a camp for an outreach that we've been doing, Chan Bok Sa students."
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:36.040]   And so he comes to the camp, and he's been coming to fellowship.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:41.860]   And then one night, after basketball, me and Ken, we were having dinner with him.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:47.300]   And we just said, "You know, Jonah, you've been learning about Jesus.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.700]   You've been coming to fellowship.
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.540]   You came to our camp.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:53.780]   What do you think about Jesus, honestly?"
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.380]   And I shared the gospel with him.
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.100]   I drew it out for him.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.140]   You know, the first step, God wants a relationship with us.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.140]   The problem is sin.
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.700]   Jesus is the solution to sin.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.180]   And what do you think about it?
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:17.660]   And he's like, "I really think that God is real, and I really want to know him more.
[00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:24.780]   And I'm willing to ask him into my life to be my Lord and Savior."
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.980]   And the next slide, you'll see this photo.
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:30.300]   I wrote it out here.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:36.580]   Jonah accepted Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior on November 20th, 2021.
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:40.020]   And the witnesses were me and Ken.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:46.980]   And this was six months of getting to know Jonah, connecting with him, choosing to be
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:53.580]   intentional, caring about him, his spiritual background, caring about what his spiritual
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:34:02.780]   need was, and eventually leading him towards Christ himself.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:09.000]   When you encounter Christ, your life will change.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.060]   And Jonah has moved to the UK, and we still keep up.
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:19.600]   We still call on a regular basis, and we do some discipleship and read the Bible together.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.140]   And he's actually recently telling me, "Oh, I'm starting to serve more in church.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:27.540]   I'm starting to play the piano and join the worship team."
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:35.020]   And he goes to a church regularly and a youth group, a university group regularly.
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:43.000]   And it's amazing to see how this person, who grew up with a Confucius background, Confucius
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.120]   high school background, has come to know Jesus.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.800]   And we can be witnesses, not just me as a witness.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.880]   You can be witnesses for Jesus as well.
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:02.520]   It doesn't mean you have to take a 12-step program to know how to share the gospel.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.940]   You can share the gospel.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.360]   You can be a witness.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:10.600]   And we see this from the Samaritan woman herself.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.600]   Let's read together.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.400]   John 4, verse 28 to 30.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:21.480]   "Then, leaving her water jar, the woman went back to the town and said to the people, 'Come,
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.900]   see a man who told me everything I ever did.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.920]   Could this be the Messiah?'
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:31.760]   They came out from the town and made their way toward him."
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:38.960]   And actually, in the next couple verses, it says, "Many people came to know and accept
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:45.440]   Jesus as the Messiah on account of the testimony from this woman."
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.760]   This woman just got to know Jesus.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.240]   She didn't even go through Alpha or 101 or 102 or 103.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:36:00.420]   But what she did, she knew who Jesus was, and that encounter changed her life.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.560]   And what did she do?
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:07.960]   She couldn't help but go back into her town and tell people, "This is a person who told
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.840]   me everything I ever did.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.980]   Could this be God?
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:17.680]   Could this be the Messiah, the person, the Savior that we've been longing for?"
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.120]   And just like this woman, we can be witnesses.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.520]   Tell the person beside you, you can be a witness for Jesus.
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:32.480]   Tell them enthusiastically.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:39.200]   You can be a witness for Jesus.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.840]   When you encounter Christ, your life will change.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:52.520]   As you see in the next slide, when you encounter Christ, your life will change.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:59.200]   The Samaritan woman encountered Jesus Christ, and because of that, her life was changed.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:06.560]   And out of that relationship, there was an overflowing, outpouring of this desire to
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:13.800]   witness, to talk about what Jesus had done.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:20.040]   Today, will you be a witness?
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.560]   Will you be a witness?
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:35.040]   As the band comes up, I want us to just close our eyes and think about the circle of friends
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:40.320]   that God has placed in your life, the circle of relationships that God has placed in your
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:47.520]   life.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:38:08.200]   Is there one or two names that God is speaking to you about these one or two or three people?
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:20.280]   That he's asking you to choose to be intentional with, to care about them, to connect with
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:27.620]   them, and lead them eventually towards Christ.
[00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:39.460]   Is there one or two names that Jesus is speaking to you?
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:46.740]   Let's just take a moment to intentionally start praying for these one or two people
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:56.780]   that God has placed in your heart, that he's asking you to witness to.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.580]   Maybe it's a family member.
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:05.740]   Maybe it's a friend, a long-time friend.
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:06.740]   Maybe it's a co-worker.
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:13.460]   Let's spend some time.
[00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:31.060]   Who is Jesus asking you to witness to today?
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:40:01.020]   Heavenly Father, we place these people that
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:11.020]   you've put into our lives into your hands.
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:19.020]   We ask that, Lord, you would guide us by your Holy Spirit to be intentional, to choose to
[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:30.900]   be intentional, to connect with these people, that we could care about them.
[00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.980]   Care about their spiritual background.
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:37.020]   Care about their needs.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.420]   Give us wisdom.
[00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:46.680]   Guide us by your Spirit to know the timing, the right timing, that we can lead them one
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.940]   step closer to Christ.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:53.420]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.020]   Amen.
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.600]   (upbeat music)
