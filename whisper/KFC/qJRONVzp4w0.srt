1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
 Thank you so much, Pastor John, and it's amazing to see all of you.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,760
 I'm glad all you are healthy and Hong Kong is looking strong and we're so excited to

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,480
 continue this series, Mark My Word.

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,840
 Today, the word is blessed, blessed.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,800
 And so I want you to type in your chat what comes to mind when you hear this word blessed

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,000
 as you see in the next slide.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,760
 What comes to mind in what comes to mind when you see this word blessed?

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,600
 Is it blessings of blessing?

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:47,800
 I'm blessed because what comes to mind when you hear this word blessed?

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 God?

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,000
 Yes, God is blessed.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,160
 Grace.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,680
 Blessed is the name of the Lord.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
 Very good.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,680
 Yeah.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,720
 What about others?

17
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,720
 Any others?

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
 Happy?

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,720
 Yeah.

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
 If you're blessed, you should be happy, I guess.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
 Yeah, absolutely.

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
 Very good.

23
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,760
 The Beatitudes, protected, being protected by God, protection from Him.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,760
 That's excellent.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,760
 Very good.

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,760
 Persecution.

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
 Yes.

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,160
 I mean, in the Beatitudes, it says, "Blessed are those who persecute you," right?

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,040
 "For your reward will be in heaven."

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
 Absolutely.

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
 Inheritance.

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
 Very good.

33
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,120
 It is good to give as well as to receive.

34
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
 Very good.

35
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,120
 Excellent.

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,880
 And as Pastor John said earlier, Palm Sunday is the start of the Holy Week for Christians,

37
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,560
 and that is Jesus' approach towards Jerusalem, and then finally, towards His death and His

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,840
 resurrection.

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,840
 And for Jews, it is the celebration of Passover.

40
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,160
 And we're going to take a look at the film.

41
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,920
 It's been amazing to have the film with us and just having live just examples of what

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,000
 Jesus did, what He spoke.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,600
 And so, Bonnie, take it away.

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,440
 Let's see the video.

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,320
 As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, Jesus

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:23,080
 sent two of His disciples, saying to them, "Go to the village ahead of you, and just

47
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,200
 as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there, which no one has ever ridden.

48
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,780
 Untie it and bring it here.

49
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,560
 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this?'

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:43,000
 say, 'The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.'"

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,060
 They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a doorway.

52
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,480
 As they untied it, some people standing there asked, "What are you doing, untying that

53
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
 colt?"

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:03,040
 They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the people let them go.

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,960
 When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, He sat on it.

56
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,440
 Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut

57
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,320
 in the fields.

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,680
 Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna!

59
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,080
 Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,600
 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our Father David!

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:41,600
 Hosanna in the highest heaven!"

62
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,000
 Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,120
 He looked around at everything, but since it was already late, He went out to Bethany

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:02,240
 with the twelve.

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,200
 All right, what an excellent clip.

66
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,760
 And so, we see here that Jesus was approaching Jerusalem.

67
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,760
 Now, we know from the other gospel passages that Jesus had been to Jerusalem before, right?

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,020
 Just like any good Jew, they would go to the temple and continue to have different rituals

69
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,800
 and different festivals.

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,960
 And so, this wasn't the first time Jesus entered Jerusalem, that this was possibly, or we know,

71
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,760
 that it is His final time to Jerusalem before His death and resurrection.

72
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,240
 And so, it's very interesting here.

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,440
 We see that Jesus enters Bethany and goes to the Mount, at the Mountain of Olives, and

74
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,280
 He tells the disciples to go and find a colt, right?

75
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:55,040
 So, it could be a young donkey or a young horse, and He told them to bring it to Him

76
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,880
 because the Lord needs it.

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,760
 And it's very funny here.

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,280
 When do we ever see Jesus say that He needs something?

79
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,800
 Or maybe the Lord is referring to God, or some people could say it could be God or it

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,080
 could be Jesus, but when does He ever say that God needs something?

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,200
 It is very interesting here to point out.

82
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,440
 And so, we see sort of the map of Jerusalem here.

83
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,720
 We see in the next slide that He's going through Bethany and Beth-ayahsh towards Jerusalem.

84
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,080
 And so, this is around, the Mount of Olives is around 826 meters above sea level.

85
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,160
 Jerusalem is 785 meters above sea level.

86
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:51,680
 So, it's not a huge mountain, it's a little hill, possibly the size of, probably shorter

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,800
 than Lion's Rock here, right?

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,120
 Jesus is sort of on the mountain and He's about to descend, and that is when we see

89
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,800
 His triumphant entry into Jerusalem.

90
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,400
 And so, we're going to see four things here about the blessed Messiah tonight.

91
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,720
 The first thing is that we are blessed by His presence.

92
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,720
 We are blessed by His peace.

93
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,480
 We are blessed when we praise Him.

94
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,400
 We are blessed by His purpose.

95
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,760
 And so, first of all, we are blessed by His presence.

96
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,280
 And so, when somebody amazing comes into the room, when somebody of power, or when Pastor

97
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,800
 John comes into the room, the room comes alive, right?

98
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,000
 There's instant chatter, there's instant excitement in the room, right?

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,400
 And so, we are blessed in the presence of a King that is coming.

100
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,920
 And when Jesus comes, He's coming in humility.

101
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:01,440
 He's coming in a donkey, or a small colt, or a small horse, right?

102
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
 He comes as a servant King.

103
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,240
 He's not coming to just be served and to be praised, but He's coming to seek and to save

104
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
 and to serve.

105
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,720
 He is a servant King.

106
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:20,440
 And it says, and it was prophesied in Zechariah 9, verse 9, "Behold, your King is coming to

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,440
 you.

108
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:29,160
 Righteous and having salvation is He, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal

109
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
 of a donkey."

110
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,640
 And so, it was prophesied in the Old Testament that Jesus would come, and that He would come

111
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,600
 as a King on a donkey.

112
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,880
 And it's also interesting that in the Old Testament, He's not the only King that rides

113
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,640
 into Jerusalem, or rides as a King on a mule or a donkey.

114
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,320
 King Solomon also did that in the Old Testament.

115
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,680
 And so, firstly, we are blessed by His presence.

116
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:07,560
 The presence of this King is humility, a servant King, willing to obey God, God's will, the

117
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,400
 Father's will, to the point of death towards the cross.

118
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:20,760
 And so, I remember when I went on the ski trip to Japan, and I went with all these,

119
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,360
 you know, CEOs, executives, doctors, business owners, and I was like, "Whoa."

120
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,120
 I was in this room and having dinner with them, and I was like, "Whoa, these guys are

121
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,440
 all, you know, probably millionaires or really rich people."

122
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,200
 And I was like, "I don't belong in this room," right?

123
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,360
 But then, they spoke to me.

124
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,520
 They looked me into the eye.

125
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,440
 They asked about me.

126
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,680
 They cared for me.

127
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:55,000
 And so, I felt the humility of these people who were rich, who were, you know, high class,

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,480
 who were, you know, big rollers, right?

129
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,520
 That these people had humility.

130
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,600
 And that is sort of like Jesus.

131
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:11,880
 Jesus, He is enthroned in heaven, and yet He is willing to come and eat with us and

132
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,000
 be among us, a people that is sinner and don't deserve His presence.

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,480
 But that is Jesus, that we are blessed by His humility, His servant heart.

134
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,760
 In His presence, we are blessed.

135
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:36,840
 And next, we see that the Jews, they were also expecting something from this Messiah,

136
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,320
 right?

137
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,160
 They expected a Messiah to be coming on a war horse.

138
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,600
 They were expecting Him to be proud, right?

139
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,160
 Chin up, right?

140
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,400
 Everybody put their chin up, you know?

141
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,480
 They expected, yeah, Gabe, I see you, right?

142
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:01,160
 They expected this King, this Messiah to be coming and saving them in physical power,

143
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,720
 mighty, amazing, that Jesus rides in, not on a mighty war horse, right?

144
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:15,240
 Like those crazy Roman emperors that are coming in with their whole entire armies.

145
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,680
 No, Jesus rides in, in a colt, a baby horse, a donkey.

146
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,920
 And He doesn't come with physical power, with a huge army beside Him.

147
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,840
 He comes with His disciples, His disciples.

148
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,840
 And next, we see the second thing, is that we are blessed by His peace.

149
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:45,240
 Coming on a colt, on a donkey, also symbolizes peace.

150
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,840
 And we know that throughout the New Testament and in the Old Testament,

151
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,440
 Jesus is called the Prince of Peace.

152
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,400
 And then in the midst of the greatest storm, He is the one that calms the storm.

153
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,240
 He is the one that gives peace.

154
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:12,120
 And so, Jesus also says to the disciples, "Peace I leave with you, peace I give to you,

155
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,200
 not as the world gives.

156
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,320
 Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid."

157
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,120
 In the presence of Jesus, there is peace.

158
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,360
 And we are blessed by His peace.

159
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,000
 And so, these Jews, they were expecting victory, as we see in the next slide.

160
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,160
 We were, they were expecting victory over the Romans,

161
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,160
 because the Romans had been empowering them, right?

162
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,920
 Jews had been overthrown and overpowered for so many centuries, right?

163
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,240
 First, the Egyptians, and then the Persians, and then the Syrians,

164
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,200
 and then the Babylonians, and now the Romans.

165
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,040
 And so, they were expecting this Messiah, this Saviour,

166
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,080
 to grant them victory over the Romans, so that they would be restored.

167
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,120
 But Jesus came, not for peace with the Romans.

168
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,360
 Jesus came to restore their inner peace,

169
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,160
 because their peace with God was broken because of sin.

170
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:25,080
 And so, Jesus came for inner peace, to restore this broken relationship with God,

171
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,080
 so that they could have peace with God once again.

172
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,160
 And so, on the chat, I want you to write,

173
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,000
 when was a time that you experienced the peace of Christ?

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,600
 When have you experienced Him in the midst of all the storms of your life?

175
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,000
 Maybe the storms of this pandemic, not being able to travel.

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,360
 Maybe the economic disaster, or the things that have been going on.

177
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,720
 When have you experienced the peace of Christ in your life?

178
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,640
 Would you like to share?

179
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,480
 Every day, very good.

180
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,440
 There are so many storms in our lives every day.

181
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,360
 Maybe in the MTR, right?

182
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,360
 There's just so much, you know, it's like zombies, right?

183
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,440
 Travelling from one place to another.

184
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:26,680
 And you've experienced peace in the MTR, in the midst of all these people going on.

185
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,440
 You know, just being able to run.

186
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,800
 Okay, being still.

187
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,240
 Yeah, absolutely.

188
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,600
 Just being able to sit and be still before the Lord.

189
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,400
 Yes, in the midst of storms.

190
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,920
 Absolutely.

191
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:49,400
 You know, so many people are experiencing mental illness, right?

192
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,840
 And we talked about that in our student college program.

193
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,640
 She's been going through these things where her friend had committed suicide,

194
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,120
 and she was seeking the peace of God.

195
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,800
 Yes, when you pray, you experience the peace of God.

196
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,560
 Absolutely.

197
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,920
 Praying is us humbling ourselves before God,

198
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,280
 and saying that, "God, we need you in this situation, in our lives."

199
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,920
 So, we've seen two things already.

200
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,720
 That we've been blessed by His presence.

201
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,920
 We've been blessed by His peace.

202
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,560
 We are blessed, absolutely.

203
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,800
 We experience peace when we let Him take control, right?

204
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,480
 And when we surrender our lives.

205
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,000
 Thank you, Florence, for that.

206
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,080
 And so, we're going to see two other things.

207
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,840
 That we are blessed as we praise Him, and we are blessed by His purpose.

208
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,360
 And so, let's read verse 9 once again.

209
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,800
 "Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted,

210
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,520
 'Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!

211
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,600
 Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!

212
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:07,560
 Blessed is he! Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna in the highest!'"

213
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,880
 And so, when there is a king, what happens?

214
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,000
 There are often gifts for a king.

215
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,880
 What happens when Jesus was born?

216
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:26,440
 The Magi, the kings of the East, they brought frankincense, myrrh, and gold, right?

217
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,640
 And so, what do we bring?

218
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,920
 What do we bring to the king?

219
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,640
 We bring our praise to the king.

220
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:43,720
 When we praise the king, there is just an amazing feeling of just worshipping Him.

221
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:51,480
 There's an amazing feeling of being blessed as we sing songs of surrender towards Jesus,

222
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,280
 towards Him.

223
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,040
 It's amazing that throughout the New Testament,

224
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,280
 Jesus didn't allow people to praise Him, right?

225
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,880
 Whenever demons said, "This is the Son of God,"

226
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,840
 or "This is Messiah," or "This is the King,"

227
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,160
 He would often tell demons to be quiet, or tell the disciples to not let people yet know

228
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,520
 that He is the King, or who He is.

229
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,560
 And that is because His time had not yet come.

230
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,880
 And this is the first time that He is receiving praise from the people, right?

231
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,120
 It's sort of like a red carpet, right?

232
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,000
 People are putting cloaks onto the donkey,

233
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,520
 putting cloaks onto the floor,

234
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,720
 palm trees onto the floor,

235
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,880
 waving palm trees as well.

236
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,080
 They're giving Jesus the praise and the glory and the gifts that He deserved.

237
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,680
 And this is the first time we see that He allows it.

238
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,560
 And they cry, "Hosanna, Hosanna!"

239
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,600
 And that means, "Deliver us now," or "Save now," in Hebrew.

240
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,920
 And it's amazing that if we do not praise this King,

241
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
 if you do not praise this King,

242
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,240
 in a similar version in Luke chapter 19,

243
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,720
 who also talks about the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem,

244
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,560
 He says that, "I tell you, if you were silent,

245
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,120
 "the very stones would cry out."

246
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,160
 If you don't praise Jesus, if you don't praise this King,

247
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,800
 even the rocks will cry out.

248
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,720
 Isn't that amazing?

249
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,320
 You know, when you're rock climbing, can you imagine?

250
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,080
 The rocks are praising Jesus.

251
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:47,000
 Every hold, every crimp, every foothold that you have,

252
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,960
 those footholds, those crimps, those jugs that you're holding onto,

253
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,080
 those rocks are praising Jesus.

254
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,920
 If you don't praise Jesus, the rocks will cry out.

255
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,000
 It's amazing.

256
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,360
 And I shared the story of Ken earlier, right?

257
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,880
 As we see in the next slide, as we worship the Lord,

258
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,800
 and as he was worshiping the Lord late last year,

259
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,480
 and as he was singing about the reckless love of God,

260
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,800
 our student Ken came to know Jesus,

261
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,000
 and he confessed Jesus to be Lord and Savior

262
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,520
 when he was in a worship service, praising God.

263
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,680
 And that's because when we praise God,

264
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,160
 and we give Him all the glory and honor that He deserves,

265
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,840
 somehow we are blessed in His presence.

266
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,560
 We are blessed as we praise God.

267
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:46,600
 And Ken shared that he was blessed and confessed Jesus

268
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,240
 to be the Lord and Savior of his life

269
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,480
 the first time when he entered into worship of the Lord.

270
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,320
 So we are blessed in His presence.

271
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,880
 And the Jews, so we see that the Jews were looking

272
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:05,160
 for a proud king who would come on a war horse.

273
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,120
 They were looking for a physically powerful king

274
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,280
 that would come with his armies.

275
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,560
 He would have victory over the Romans.

276
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,720
 He was looking for, they were looking for a king,

277
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,600
 a Messiah that would save them physically,

278
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,160
 that would bless them physically.

279
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,040
 But no, Jesus came to save them,

280
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,480
 not just from physical sin,

281
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,600
 not physically, but also spiritually.

282
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:41,080
 Jesus came ultimately to save them from sin and death,

283
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,840
 and to conquer death once and for all.

284
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:48,600
 And the last thing that we're blessed by

285
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,920
 is we're blessed by His purpose.

286
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,680
 Jesus came for a specific purpose,

287
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:00,440
 and that is to seek and save that which He was lost.

288
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,880
 He came not just to do miracles,

289
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,080
 not just to touch the brokenhearted,

290
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,880
 the lepers, the women at the well.

291
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,160
 No, He came ultimately for all of us.

292
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,640
 His purpose was to be an ultimate sacrifice,

293
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,800
 to be a sacrificial lamb.

294
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:27,720
 Isn't it amazing that at the start of this Jewish Passover,

295
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:35,000
 and they were remembering how God had saved them from Egypt,

296
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,960
 and they were looking to slaughter lamb,

297
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,240
 and the blood shed, and they were putting it at the door,

298
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,120
 blood would protect them from the angel of death,

299
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,320
 that Jesus came as the ultimate sacrifice,

300
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:57,720
 the ultimate lamb that would be dying for them on the cross once and for all.

301
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,760
 His blood shed for you and me,

302
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:07,400
 so that the Lord would have peace with us once again,

303
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,800
 and that our relationship with Him would be restored.

304
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:20,520
 And so, we see that the Jews were looking for restoration of Israel.

305
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,480
 They wanted Israel to be restored to the times of King David,

306
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,160
 to the grandeur of King Solomon,

307
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,720
 with all his riches and all his wisdom.

308
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,720
 They wanted Israel to be at the forefront of the world,

309
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,240
 to be on the map again.

310
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,520
 They expected this Messiah to come and restore Israel.

311
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,360
 But Jesus came to restore our citizenship in heaven.

312
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:57,000
 The Jews were looking for an earthly, a physical restoration of Israel,

313
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,400
 but Jesus was looking for a spiritual and a heavenly restoration,

314
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,960
 making us a new creation in heaven before the Lord.

315
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,080
 And so, the question we have to ask is,

316
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,280
 do we have the right view of the Messiah?

317
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,040
 Right?

318
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,440
 We have learned here that we have been blessed.

319
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,120
 We have been blessed by His presence, the presence of the King.

320
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,760
 We are blessed by the peace of the King.

321
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,840
 We are blessed as we praise Him.

322
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,280
 We are blessed because of His purpose to save us,

323
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,920
 to become the sacrificial lamb, to be the ultimate sacrifice for us.

324
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:47,240
 Have you experienced the blessings that come with the King?

325
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,800
 And the next question we have to ask is,

326
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,840
 do we have the right view of the Messiah?

327
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:03,400
 The Jews did not see the Messiah as Jesus presented Himself, right?

328
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,840
 Once again, the Jews were looking for a proud,

329
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,880
 mighty warrior, victory over the Romans.

330
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,640
 They were looking for a physical victory and a restoration of Israel to its might.

331
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,440
 But Jesus came humble.

332
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,040
 He came to restore peace, our peace with God.

333
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,280
 He came so that we would be saved from physical,

334
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,560
 a spiritual damnation from our own sin and death.

335
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:37,880
 Jesus came to restore our citizenship in heaven.

336
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,480
 And so do we have the right view of the Messiah?

337
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,120
 Maybe, you know, we know of Jesus,

338
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:54,040
 but we haven't truly given Him all the control in our life.

339
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:58,600
 Here are some questions that help us to ponder in the next slide.

340
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,200
 Do we truly believe that Jesus is in control?

341
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,920
 Just like Florence said, right, as we give up control,

342
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,920
 we have peace, truly peace from God.

343
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:15,720
 If we truly believe that Jesus is in control and that God is sovereign over things,

344
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,760
 then why is it that we're running around trying to control everything in our life?

345
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:27,160
 Do we truly believe that Jesus is in control?

346
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,920
 Do we truly believe that Jesus has what is best for us?

347
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,160
 If we believe He has what is best for us,

348
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,000
 then why are we trying to change everything and manipulating everything

349
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,080
 when we should just trust Him and ask Him to open doors for us?

350
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,040
 Obviously, we need to do our part.

351
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,560
 I'm not saying do nothing.

352
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,400
 I'm saying we do our part, but we trust that He has best for us.

353
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,240
 But a lot of times we're not living our lives

354
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,840
 like we truly believe that He has what is best for us.

355
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,760
 I have a plan.

356
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,520
 My plan is the best, and we are shattered when our plan doesn't work out

357
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:16,120
 because it shows that we believe we have what is best for us.

358
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,320
 And if we surrendered to the King, if we surrendered to the Lord,

359
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,720
 then we would have peace, true peace.

360
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,960
 Are we saved by grace?

361
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,120
 Do we believe that we are saved by grace and not by works?

362
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,080
 And because I'm a doer, right, I sometimes get in this trap

363
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,560
 where I believe that the more I do for Jesus,

364
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,600
 the more I help people to come to know Jesus,

365
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,520
 the more people that come to know faith,

366
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:50,920
 then God would love me more.

367
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,120
 I fall into that trap sometimes because I am a doer.

368
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,760
 I think that, oh, if I help out with this fellowship

369
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,560
 and that fellowship and this ministry and that ministry,

370
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,840
 and if I do more for Jesus, then He'll love me more.

371
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:13,960
 But that's not right because God loves me as I am, right?

372
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,920
 There's no way I can gain more money or gain more works

373
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,240
 so that God would love me more.

374
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,880
 No, God loves us unconditionally.

375
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,560
 And sometimes we go from relationship to relationship

376
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,440
 to relationship, trying to find love

377
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:37,720
 when we should truly believe that this Messiah

378
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,600
 loves us unconditionally.

379
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,160
 We are loved.

380
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,840
 We don't need to go around seeking love from relationship

381
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,680
 to relationship to relationship

382
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,360
 because we know that Jesus died for us.

383
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,760
 God loves us so much that Jesus was sent by God,

384
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,240
 His one and only Son,

385
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,720
 so that we could have a restored relationship with Him.

386
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,640
 And it's interesting how this passage ends here.

387
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,800
 Let's look at the next verses here.

388
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,120
 "Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts,

389
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,920
 and He looked around at everything,

390
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,040
 but since it was already late,

391
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,040
 He went out to Bethany with the twelve."

392
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,040
 It's interesting here

393
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,080
 because there's multiple accounts of this.

394
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,360
 You know, in Matthew, what happens is Jesus arrives

395
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,120
 and they're shouting "Hosanna!"

396
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,880
 and they place Baham branches,

397
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,920
 and then what happens is that Jerusalem was stirred up.

398
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,440
 They're like, "Who is this?

399
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,720
 Who is this Jesus?"

400
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,880
 And they're like, "Oh, Jesus, this is the prophet

401
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,360
 that has come," or "This is the Messiah that has come."

402
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,440
 There was confusion in the city.

403
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,320
 That's what Matthew accounts for.

404
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,240
 And then in the Gospel of Luke, when Jesus comes in,

405
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,680
 they were like, "Even the stones will rise up

406
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,120
 and praise the Lord."

407
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,640
 There was a sense of praise.

408
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,840
 The city was stirred up to praise God.

409
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,000
 But here in the account of Mark,

410
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,440
 it says that Jesus entered the temple courts,

411
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,640
 and He looked around at everything,

412
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,360
 and then He went back to Bethany.

413
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:28,440
 What's interesting here is that they were praising Jesus

414
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,960
 as He was entering into Jerusalem,

415
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,480
 but as He arrived to the temple,

416
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,520
 to the temple courts,

417
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,040
 when God arrives to the temple courts,

418
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,120
 where is everybody?

419
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,360
 Where are the priests?

420
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,080
 Where are the people?

421
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,200
 God Himself has arrived in the place where He,

422
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,920
 where this place was, the temple of heaven,

423
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:03,880
 was created for God, and God Himself has entered,

424
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,680
 and they do not praise Him.

425
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,640
 Nobody's there.

426
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,560
 Mark accounts that He went around,

427
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,600
 He looked around at everything, and then He left.

428
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,360
 And it is as if the Jews had missed God Himself,

429
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,640
 Jesus in the flesh, the Word made flesh,

430
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,560
 as He went into the temple Himself.

431
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,480
 And it is a stark reminder for us

432
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,320
 that the Jews missed Jesus.

433
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,200
 They made the temple for God,

434
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,120
 and when God, Jesus,

435
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,480
 Himself enters it,

436
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,480
 they didn't even know He was there.

437
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:58,200
 And so, could it be for the same for us today,

438
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,640
 that as we went into the church,

439
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,000
 as we go into worshipping God on Zoom here

440
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 or to the church physically,

441
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,280
 have we missed Jesus?

442
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,000
 Maybe we don't even recognize Jesus.

443
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 We've missed Him.

444
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,680
 Just like the Jews,

445
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,240
 they didn't recognize Jesus

446
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,160
 as He went to the temple Himself.

447
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,720
 And so I hope, my hope is that

448
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,040
 we recognize Jesus as we go to church,

449
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:41,400
 and that we know that He is our Savior.

450
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,600
 He is God of the universe.

451
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,280
 And that one day, it says in Revelations,

452
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,880
 as we see in the next slide,

453
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,640
 He is coming again.

454
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,160
 I am coming soon.

455
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,160
 My reward is with me,

456
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,480
 and I will give to each person

457
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,720
 according to what they have done.

458
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,400
 I am the Alpha and the Omega,

459
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,840
 the first and the last,

460
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,760
 the beginning and the end.

461
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,240
 Jesus will come again.

462
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,680
 Jesus will come again.

463
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,600
 And this time, He will come victorious

464
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,720
 in power, in judgment,

465
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,080
 and He will come in victory.

466
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:29,080
 And so I pray that we have not missed Jesus,

467
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,040
 that we have not misunderstood who Jesus is,

468
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,680
 and that we have claimed Him

469
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,800
 to be Hosanna, our Savior, once and for all.

470
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,400
 God bless you on this Palm Sunday.

471
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,840
 May you recognize the Messiah and who He is.

472
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,160
 We're going to respond now in a song called "Hosanna."

473
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,120
 Let's pray.

474
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,080
 Heavenly Father, we thank You for Your presence,

475
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,040
 that we are blessed by the presence of the King.

476
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,280
 We are blessed by the peace of the King.

477
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,720
 We are blessed as we praise You.

478
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,960
 And as we come into worshiping You now,

479
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,720
 You are Hosanna in the highest.

480
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:21,720
 May You, may You be pleased with our praises to You.

481
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,160
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.
