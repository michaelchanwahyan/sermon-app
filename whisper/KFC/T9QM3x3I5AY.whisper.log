[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.800]   We're continuing our parables, and Paul did a wonderful job last time on the shrewd manager,
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.400]   Gabe the week--I mean, Pastor John the week before on prodigal son, and Gabe before on
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.840]   the rich fool.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.920]   And so we're sort of on a trend here--lost son.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.200]   And before then, it was the lost sheep and the lost coin.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.160]   There was something that was lost.
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:46.840]   And also, the shrewd manager, he also possibly lost something, right?
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.000]   He lost his job.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.240]   But he used it to prepare for the afterlife.
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.720]   Prepare for the afterlife.
[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.200]   Now human civilization has always been obsessed with afterlife, right?
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600]   We go back to the Greeks.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.720]   They thought Mount Olympus was the place for the afterlife, and the gods, Zeus and Poseidon,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.720]   and they all determined whether you would go to the afterlife, right?
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.000]   It determined by your works and your sacrifices.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.560]   The Egyptians, they had the process called mummification.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.720]   It was to preserve your body, right?
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.920]   They took out your heart and your organs to preserve it and you preserve your body so
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.080]   that it would be there for the afterlife.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:41.160]   Now, the Chinese emperor, right, he also tried to prepare and conquer the afterlife, right?
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.240]   He had--anybody been here?
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240]   Anybody seen these?
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.240]   Yeah?
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.280]   It was beautiful, right?
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.400]   He prepared thousands of these things so that he could try and go and conquer the afterlife,
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.680]   conquer death, and conquer the afterlife.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.680]   And so today, we're going to learn about a story that Jesus told.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.280]   And firstly, we're going to read about the life, the life of two people.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.400]   Let's read together the life of these two people.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400]   Let's read together.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   One, two, three.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   "There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, feasted strumptiously every
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   day.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:29.120]   And at his gate laid a poor man named Lazarus covered with sores who desired to be fed of
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.480]   the rich man.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.280]   Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores."
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.520]   All right.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.080]   So here we have a story of a rich man.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.840]   And this really poor person at his door.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.400]   Anybody been to Mumbai before?
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.480]   Anybody been to Mumbai?
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.040]   And we're--in Mumbai, there are slums, right?
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.820]   And it's amazing, you know, Shahrukh Khan, you know, million, billion-dollar house right
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.400]   beside possibly the slums, right?
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.560]   These really poor people.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.080]   And I've been into the slums.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.760]   There's hardly any--there's no fresh water.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.960]   There's barely any electricity.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.720]   And it's the rich beside the poor.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.720]   And in the same way, we have the super rich person here, right?
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.240]   Super rich person.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.280]   And Lazarus is right at his door.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.840]   Now, we see a couple of comparisons between the rich and the Lazarus man.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.080]   The rich man and the Lazarus.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.160]   So firstly, the rich man, he was clothed in purple.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.320]   Do you know how they got purple dye back then?
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.680]   Do you know how they got it back then?
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.840]   It was from snails.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.520]   It was a very expensive process.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.600]   And only the richest of the rich people got to wear purple.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.020]   That's why the kings and the rich people were clothed in purple.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.120]   The Bible says he was a rich and luxurious man.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.640]   And Lazarus was poor.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.160]   And he was a beggar.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.000]   This rich man was healthy and well-dressed.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.240]   And Lazarus was clothed with sores.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.000]   This rich man was possibly very clean, washed several times.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.800]   And the Lazarus man was unclean.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.360]   Now, this rich man, he was feasting.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.440]   You know, here at KFC, we like to feast as well, right?
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.440]   He was feasting.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.480]   And Lazarus, what was he looking for?
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.200]   He was looking for the crumbs off the table.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.520]   As we see in the next slide, there's a quote
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.640]   by one of the commentators.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.680]   And it says that food was eaten with hands.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.520]   And in very wealthy houses, the hands
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.360]   were cleaned by wiping them with hunks of bread, which
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.960]   were then thrown away.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.840]   This was what Lazarus was waiting for.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.040]   Imagine you are in a luxurious house, right?
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.160]   And instead of napkins, you're using slices of white bread
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.840]   to wipe your hands.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.120]   And then what do you do after?
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.400]   You throw the bread away.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.640]   You've wiped your hands.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.200]   This was what Lazarus was waiting for,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.400]   the crumbs on the bottom of the table,
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.560]   in which the rich people wiped their hands after cleaning.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.400]   The rich and the poor.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.640]   This rich man was independent, right?
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.320]   He was rich.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.860]   He was self-sufficient.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.560]   Lazarus was hoping to survive off the crumbs
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.440]   off the floor of this rich man.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.280]   Now, this rich man possibly had lots of servants,
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.120]   people coming to his aid.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.760]   What did this poor man have?
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.920]   Only dogs to lick the sores off--
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.440]   the dogs to lick the sores on his skin.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.640]   Now, I've been licked various times by Uncle Vincent's dogs.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.040]   I did not have any sores.
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.560]   I think it was because they liked me.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   What's interesting is that this rich man is unnamed.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.600]   It's unnamed.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.160]   But this poor man, his name was Lazarus.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.880]   Do you know what Lazarus, the core of this name,
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.640]   the Hebrew core of this name, comes from?
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.760]   It comes from-- it comes from Ili--
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.260]   sorry.
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.760]   I forgot.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.800]   Let me look at my notes.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.320]   I-L-- how do you say it?
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:10.040]   OK, this rich man's name, Eleazar.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.000]   Eleazar.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   I was tricking you.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.280]   I didn't know it.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.040]   Eleazar.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.160]   Do you know what it means?
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.920]   L means-- what do you guys know?
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.440]   Teaching you Hebrew now.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.880]   Kids on the phone, I'm teaching you Hebrew.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.840]   L means-- do you guys know what--
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.880]   do you know Superman?
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.720]   Supernan?
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.960]   His name was L what?
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.440]   He had a Kryptonian name.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.880]   L, it means-- take a guess.
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.400]   OK, I'll give you three choices.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.360]   It means man, first choice.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.200]   Number two, it means good.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.400]   And number three, it means God.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.480]   OK, three choices.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.600]   What do you think L means?
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.080]   I'm teaching you Hebrew here.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.360]   OK, everybody wave what finger they think it is.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.400]   One is man.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.440]   Number two is good.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.560]   Number three is God.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.040]   OK, ready?
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.040]   One, two, three.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.120]   OK, if you chose number three--
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.280]   Harper, what did you choose?
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.760]   Number three, very good.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.840]   L means God, OK?
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.480]   So what from God?
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.280]   Help from God.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.920]   Eleazar, it means God's help.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.280]   And so interestingly, this rich man was not named.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.920]   But this poor beggar, who was possibly crippled as well,
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.120]   was named.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.720]   It was personal.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.120]   God knew him.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.520]   God helped him.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.680]   Possibly he had faith.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.720]   That's why Jesus named him in this parable.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.560]   This rich man, what we can see is the opposite.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.960]   His life and his identity was found in riches.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.000]   It shaped, it defined him.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.880]   And we also saw here that he was sort of unwilling to help Lazarus.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.720]   Unwilling to help Lazarus.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.440]   So this was the life.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.000]   Two men, opposites.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   One rich, one poor, one healthy, one sick, with sores.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And now we see the death.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.520]   Let's read together the death.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.400]   One, two, three.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   The poor man died and was carried to the angels to Abraham's side.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.440]   The rich man also died and was buried.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.320]   And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:41.080]   and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.800]   OK, first of all, we see that the poor man died.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:46.360]   OK?
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.960]   The poor man died.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.840]   What about the rich man?
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.720]   He also died.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.480]   Now there is a difference.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.240]   What is the difference here?
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:03.040]   The poor man, there was no mention of a burial.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.960]   Did poor people get buried back then?
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.400]   Not likely.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.000]   Not likely.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.960]   Actually, many of them--
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.280]   click the next two slides--
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:23.880]   a lot of them were thought to have been thrown out of the city
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.520]   to a place where garbage was burned.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:33.160]   OK, anybody been to a third world country and you smell burning garbage?
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.040]   That's one of the most hated smells.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:35.920]   I hate that smell.
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.120]   It's like burning plastic or something.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.600]   Right?
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.080]   In third world countries, they do that.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.840]   They don't have a garbage disposal system, so they burn.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:50.040]   And possibly what happened was this poor man was not buried either.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.000]   OK, it showed that nobody really cared about him,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.320]   that he didn't have any money, that he was just thrown out like garbage
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.560]   into this pit of burning garbage.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.520]   Lazarus, on the other hand, there was a mention of burial.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:13.480]   Now, I was just helping in a funeral several weeks ago,
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.760]   as you see in the previous slide of this one.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.440]   Now, this burial was beautiful.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.400]   It had a beautiful ceremony.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.160]   His life was celebrated.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.960]   People came.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.080]   Hundreds of people came.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.560]   Back in the olden days, in Jewish times, they would hire mourners.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:31.640]   People would cry.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.680]   They thought, oh, the more people that cried,
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.000]   it meant that you were more important.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.400]   Right?
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.880]   How many people do you want to cry at your funeral?
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.400]   A lot.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.120]   Wailers.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.360]   They would hire wailers.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   Do you want to hire wailers?
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.240]   Oh, this person's so important.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.920]   I'm going to cry.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.520]   Right?
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.960]   So there was a burial for the rich man.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.920]   And he was possibly very rich.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   And so he had a nice coffin.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.400]   Right?
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.600]   Back then, they didn't have coffins.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.840]   They had-- what did they dig out of the stone?
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.960]   They had a tomb.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.600]   That's right.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.280]   They had a tomb.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.120]   And those were very expensive as well.
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.680]   All right, so that was the death.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.680]   Both died.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.120]   One had a proper burial.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.840]   One might have just been thrown into a garbage pit of fire
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.040]   outside of the city.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.080]   Now, so we have life.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.800]   We have death.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.720]   What do we have next?
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.480]   We have the--
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:37.440]   the afterlife.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.880]   Let's read together.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.400]   Actually, we've read this.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.240]   So let's just read--
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.360]   I'll just read the verse 23.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.320]   "And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.000]   And he saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side."
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.800]   What is interesting here is that the dead rich man
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.800]   was not met with anybody after he died.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.440]   But the rich man was met with--
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.840]   was the rich man--
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.800]   Lazarus-- what was Lazarus met with?
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.400]   The angels.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.000]   And the angels carried him to Abraham's side.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.920]   And what does it mean, Abraham's side?
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.560]   To be-- who is Abraham?
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.240]   The father of the patriarchs, right?
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.920]   So it must be a good thing.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.680]   Abraham was known to be a righteous man.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.920]   So to be at his side, it must have been good.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.400]   You're beside Abraham, one of the most important people
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.360]   in Israel.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.840]   Father Abraham.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.920]   Father Abraham, right?
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.960]   Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, right?
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:49.200]   These were the important people, most important people.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:54.960]   So we see that the rich man was in Hades, all right?
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.600]   Why was the rich man in Hades?
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.360]   Was it because he was rich?
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.080]   Is that why he was brought to Hades?
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.680]   And was Lazarus saved because he was poor?
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.760]   No.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.720]   Because Abraham-- was he rich or poor?
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.800]   Was Abraham rich or poor?
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.640]   OK.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.200]   Rich?
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:18.000]   Yes, rich.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.040]   I was going to make you guess again, like my kids,
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.600]   my youth kids, get them involved.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.400]   OK.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.960]   Abraham was one of the richest people in the Old Testament.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   He had so much livestock, so many servants,
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.200]   that what happened?
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.520]   He had a fight with his nephew.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.480]   What's his nephew's name?
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.000]   Lot, right?
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.840]   They were like, oh, we need to separate.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.600]   You go left or right, you know?
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.680]   Because you go left and I'll go right, you know?
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.880]   Because we have so much stuff that we're just fighting.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.480]   Our servants are fighting, our livestock are fighting.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.760]   There's not enough grass to eat, right?
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.800]   And so they were fighting.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:04.640]   So Lazarus was rich, and he wasn't in Hades, OK?
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.000]   And Lazarus was by his side.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.680]   So what is Hades?
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.880]   Do you guys know what Hades is?
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.960]   Let's look at Hades.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.440]   Actually, in the Old Testament, our equivalent of Hades
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.240]   was Shiloh.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:27.840]   And Shiloh, or Shiloh, was a place of the dead or grave, OK?
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.080]   It says, because you will not abandon me
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.240]   in the realm of Shiloh, the dead.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.520]   Now, the Greek word is Hades, OK?
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.800]   It's also the same, equivalent, the place of the dead.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.320]   It's a place where the dead were punished.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.080]   So in Judaism, that's what they thought.
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:55.400]   When you died, you went to a place called Hades, OK?
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.960]   And seemingly, as we see in this story, the rich--
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.680]   or not, the righteous were separated from the unrighteous.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:10.880]   Let's continue to read how death is distinguished from Hades.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.880]   Also, we see that in Revelations.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.440]   Its writer's name was Death, and Hades followed him.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.720]   So we see that Death and Hades are two different things.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.640]   And we also see in the Book of Revelations,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.480]   Hades will one day be destroyed.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.640]   Let's read this in Revelations together.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.520]   The sea gave up.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.280]   Ready?
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.320]   Next slide.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:33.920]   The sea gave up.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.420]   OK, ready?
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.560]   One, two, three.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.320]   The sea gave up the dead who were in it.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.560]   And Death and Hades delivered of dead who were in them.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.920]   And Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:54.200]   So Hades is sort of a temporary place for the dead.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:59.520]   The ultimate final judgment is the lake of fire.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.600]   It's called hell, OK?
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.400]   And Jesus says this word hell in Mark chapter 9.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.720]   Let's read that together.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.880]   If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:17.800]   It is better for you to enter a life maimed with two hands
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.920]   than to go to hell, where the fire never goes out.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:28.320]   The lake of fire, hell, is the final judgment.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.560]   Hades is the place for the dead, a temporary place for the dead.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.920]   And it is a place where the unrighteous receive punishment.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   However, because Christ has died and rose again,
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.720]   he conquered victory.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.960]   He conquered death in victory, OK?
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.800]   Jesus has the keys to death and Hades.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.720]   He says this in Revelations 1.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.400]   I am he who lives and was dead.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.200]   And behold, I am alive forevermore.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   I have the keys of Hades and death.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   And next, next, the righteous go with the Lord when they die.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.000]   Let's read this together, the words of Paul.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.200]   One, two, three.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.480]   So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.320]   in the body, we are absent from the Lord.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.720]   For we will walk by faith, not by sight.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.960]   We are confident, yes, we pleased rather to be absent
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:38.200]   from the body and to be present with the Lord.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   What is Paul saying here?
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.200]   Paul is saying here, because of Christ's death on the cross
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   and his victory over death,
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.600]   we now go to the Lord directly after.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.800]   We are present with the Lord.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.760]   When we are absent from the body,
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.800]   we are present with the Lord.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   And so when Jesus died on the cross,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   there were two people beside him.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.800]   Yeah, were they good guys or bad guys?
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.800]   They were bad guys, good.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.800]   And one of them, what was he saying?
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.800]   He said, "I know you are the Christ."
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:19.800]   Right?
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   And he believed in Christ.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.800]   And what did Jesus say to him?
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.800]   "Today you will be with me in?"
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   "In paradise."
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   Paradise.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.800]   So could it be that when Jesus died,
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   the righteous now go with him,
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   present with the Lord in paradise?
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   So could it be that this person who died with Jesus,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:54.800]   maybe he was one of the first people with Jesus in paradise?
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   So Hades, where the righteous man is,
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.800]   where the rich man is, sorry,
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   where the rich man is,
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   is a place of temporary suffering and punishment
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   until the ultimate final judgment,
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   which is the lake of fire, the final judgment.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   Yes?
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   Good.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   You can talk to me after if it doesn't make sense.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.800]   All right, let's continue to read Luke chapter 16.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800]   Let's read together.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   One, two, three.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:34.800]   "And he called out, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me.'
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   "And sat Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   "and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish and in this flame.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:47.800]   "But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you in your lifetime
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   "received your good things,
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.800]   "and Lazarus in like manner bad things.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.800]   "But now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   "And besides all this, between us and you,
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   "a great chasm has been fixed,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.800]   "in order that those who would pass from here to you
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   "may not be able, and none may cross to us.'"
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   So here we see the rich man in Hades,
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   and somehow he's able to look up
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   and he sees Abraham.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   And not only does he see Abraham, he sees Lazarus.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   What's interesting here is that this person,
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.800]   this rich man is begging to Abraham.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   So possibly in this Hades place, he has memory.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.800]   It's interesting.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   He has memory of what happened in his life,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   and he sees Lazarus, and yet he still sees Lazarus
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.800]   as his servant.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.800]   Okay, he wants Lazarus to come and help him.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.800]   He still sees himself as superior.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   And he begs Abraham, "Send Lazarus to come
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   "and dip the end of his finger
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.800]   "and cool my tongue with water."
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   Okay, so once again, there is a contrast.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   But however, the roles have now been reversed.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   The rich man is now begging,
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:29.800]   and now Lazarus is in a position of comfort.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.800]   The rich man is in torment and in anguish,
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   and Lazarus is in comfort.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   It's interesting to see that this rich man
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   still sees himself as superior,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   and Lazarus as the servant.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   And it's also interesting to see that this rich man
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   is also different from last week's rich man.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   Last week's rich man, or shrewd manager,
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   used his position and his power or riches
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   to prepare him for what comes next.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   But this rich man did not use his power
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   and position and possessions to prepare himself
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   for the afterlife.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   This word, in agony, this rich man was in agony,
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.800]   and it's translated as grief or anguish.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   And it's only used several times in the New Testament.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   The one time, there's one time,
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:42.800]   is when Jesus was lost by his parents,
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.800]   Mary and Joseph, and they were in agony.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.800]   They lost their son.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.800]   Have you lost your son in the mall or something?
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   You're like, "Where's my son? Where did he go?"
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.800]   He was, you know, Joseph and Mary were in agony.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.800]   And another time it was used in the New Testament
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   was when Paul knew that he was going to go to Rome,
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   and he could no longer, this was the last time
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   he would see his friends in the church.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   He was in agony. He was in anguish.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   He had lost, they're losing something.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   They lost something.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   What did this rich man lose?
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   He lost his, what did he have that he no longer had now
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.800]   in Hades, his riches.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   He was possibly in anguish because he had lost his riches.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   Let's continue in chapter 16, verse 26.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:48.800]   One, two, three.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   "And besides all this, between us and you,
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   "a great chasm has been fixed
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   "in order that those who would pass from here to you
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   "may not be able, and none may cross from there to us."
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.800]   What is this chasm? What is this chasm?
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.800]   Some commentators say that it is
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:17.800]   between the belief of the law and the belief of grace.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.800]   Some people believe this chasm, what separates the two people
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.800]   is those who know God personally
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   and those who only know about him.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   Those are separated because of self-centered living
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   and those Christ-centered living.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   Those who live upon the flesh
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   and those who depend on the spirit.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   This is the chasm that separates the rich man and Lazarus,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   the rich man and Lazarus.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   And now, the story takes an interesting turn.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.800]   This rich man starts to care about his family.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   He sort of has a missional purpose.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   He's like, "You know what? Why don't you send Lazarus?"
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.800]   Once again, he thinks Lazarus is his amazing servant
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   that cares truly deeply about him.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   And he wants to send Lazarus back to his brothers
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.800]   so that they would not end up in the same place that he is in,
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   in anguish, in Hades, in suffering, in torment.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   And he says, let's read together, 1, 2, 3.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   And he said, "Then I beg you, Father, to send him to my father's house,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   for I have five brothers so that he may warn them,
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   lest they also come into the place of torment.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   But Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear.'
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   And he said to them, 'No, Father Abraham,
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.800]   but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.'
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.800]   He said to him, 'If they do not hear Moses and the prophets,
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead.'"
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   He's like, "Send Lazarus. If only they see somebody rise from the dead,
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:24.800]   my five brothers will come to know salvation."
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:31.800]   Some commentators say that the five brothers represent Israel.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   Judah, or yeah, Judah had five brothers
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.800]   in the family of Joseph and Benjamin.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:48.800]   Joseph, Benjamin, there was Judah, and Judah himself had five brothers.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   And so that's what some commentators think.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.800]   Save Israel. Save Jerusalem.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   Save my family so that they would come to salvation.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   And Abraham says this, "They have Moses and the prophets.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   They have no excuse."
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   They have no excuse to know about salvation.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.800]   They have no excuse.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   So we went through the life of these two very different people.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   We went through their death.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.800]   We went through their afterlife.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   And this is the aftermath.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.800]   I call it the aftermath.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:42.800]   Aftermath is what is the consequence?
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   What is the result for us?
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   What is the aftermath?
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   What can we learn?
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   The first thing that I wrote here is duty. Duty.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   This rich man was given riches.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   And what did he do with it?
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   It seems like he didn't do very much or nothing at all
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   because the consequence was he resulted in being in Hades, in torment.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   What has God given us?
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.800]   What has God given us?
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   Even the students here, what has God given you?
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.800]   What has God given you?
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   God has given these things to us not just so that we could be blessed
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.800]   and enjoy all these things.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:47.800]   God has called us to be good stewards of the things that he's given us.
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:53.800]   Whether it be our position, whether we're bosses or we're--
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   whether it be our riches financially,
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   whether it be our opportunities, God wants us to be good stewards.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   This rich man was not a good steward of the things that God had given him.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   He didn't do anything. He didn't help Lazarus.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   He still, in Hades, still looks down on Lazarus.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   "Go, dip your hand in water and cool my tongue.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   Go and help my brothers, save them."
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   We've all been given a duty to be good stewards of what God has given us.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   What has God given you?
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   Are you being a good steward of what he has given you?
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   That's the first question we need to ask ourselves, duty, stewardship.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.800]   What has God entrusted to you?
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.800]   And what are you doing with it?
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   What are you doing with it? Are you wasting it?
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   Are you wasting it?
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   The second thing is decision.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   The decisions that this rich man made in his life,
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.800]   it had eternal consequences.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   Eternal consequences.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   Lazarus, coming from the Hebrew, Eleazar, our God helps.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   Possibly he had a relationship with God,
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   and that was why he was with Abraham at his side.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   The decisions we make here on earth have eternal consequences.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.800]   Eternal consequences.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   In the parable of the tenants,
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   five was given, three was given, two was given,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   and then the manager left, and when he returned, he said,
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   "What have you done with the five?"
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   "I've gained five more."
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   "What have you done with the three that I've given you?"
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   "I've gained three more."
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   "What have you done with the one I've given you?"
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   "I dug a hole, and I hid it. I was afraid."
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   "Oh, gang, I was very afraid."
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   "I'm a gang, gang. Gang, gang."
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.800]   "Harper, gang."
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.800]   "He was afraid, and he hid it."
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   And the manager, or is it the manager? Sorry.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.800]   It was the, what was it, John?
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   The tenant.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   >> Talents. >> Talents. Sorry.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.800]   >> It's the master. >> Master, sorry.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:56.800]   Master, the master of the talents.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   Did I say tenants? My bad. It's okay.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   I was tricking you.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.800]   Thank you, thank you.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   He said, "Wicked servant, throw him out."
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.800]   Right? Where there will be gnashing of teeth.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.800]   Gnashing of teeth.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   I'm so scared of gnashing of teeth.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   All right?
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.800]   Our decisions on earth,
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   what God has given us, and what we do with the things that God has given us,
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   has eternal consequences.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   One day, the master will come back.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.800]   The ultimate master, Jesus Christ, will come back,
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:43.800]   and we will stand before him in the throne,
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   and he will judge what we have done,
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   whether good or bad.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.800]   We have a duty.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   We have a decision.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   And we have been given opportunity to discover God.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   Each one of us in this room has been given an opportunity to discover God.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   Okay? This rich man was possibly also a righteous man,
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   because in the previous verses,
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   Jesus was talking specifically to the Pharisees and the rich people
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   who had riches physically,
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   but not eternal riches in their heart.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.800]   It also says in Romans, let's read in Romans together,
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   verse 18, chapter 1, verse 18.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   Let's read together. One, two, three.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   The wrath of the God is being revealed from heaven against all godlessness
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   and wickedness of people who suppress the truth by their wickedness.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   Since what may be known about God is plain to them,
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   because God has made it plain to them.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   For since the creation of the world,
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   God's invisible qualities, his eternal power, and divine nature
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.800]   has been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made,
[00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   so that people are without excuses.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   There is no excuse, it says here.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   God has made it plain, plainly known, his invisible qualities, his power.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   He has shown it.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   If you don't know the word of God, he's shown it in creation.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   There's no excuse.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   There is no excuse.
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   This rich man had no excuse.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   He had Moses and the prophets as well.
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   Some people don't have the law and the prophets,
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.800]   but what do they have? They have God's creation.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.800]   It says it right here.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   His power, his invisible qualities, it's shown in what he has made.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:02.800]   We have the opportunity to discover God, all of us.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   We all have the opportunity to discover God.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:12.800]   Next, dependent, dependent.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   What was the rich man dependent on in his life?
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   His wealth. His wealth defined him.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.800]   Jesus says, "The rich man." He doesn't even give him a name,
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   because he was shaped by his riches.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   He's so dependent on his riches that it defined who he is.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   KFC, what are we dependent on in our life today?
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:52.800]   Are we dependent on the number of zeros in our bank account?
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:58.800]   Are we dependent on our physical strong bodies?
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   Are we dependent on love relationships?
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   That will carry us through.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.800]   What are we dependent on? Are we dependent on the stock market?
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   Are we dependent on the banks this week?
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.800]   Are we dependent on the banks this week?
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.800]   Choose your bank wisely.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.800]   What are we dependent on?
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:28.800]   This rich man was so dependent on his riches that it cost him eternity.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   Jesus says, "What good is it for a man to gain the world, but forfeit his soul?"
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   You can gain the world, but lose your soul.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   Paul had a great example. This life is just monopoly money.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.800]   It's just monopoly money.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.800]   The last thing, the last D is this.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:57.800]   Do you recognize that there is a Deliverer?
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   And this Deliverer is Jesus Christ.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   He is the only person that we should be fully dependent on
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   to be our Lord, our Savior, the bread of life, living water.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   He is that. He is that.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   Let's take some time to reflect on our life as the band comes up.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:45.800]   Which one of these D words is the Holy Spirit and God speaking to you personally?
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   Is it duty? Has God given you something?
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   Money, power, position?
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.800]   And what are you using it for?
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   Are you being a good steward of what God has given you?
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:09.800]   Are you being a good steward?
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   Decision.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   Your decision on this earth has eternal consequences.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   What decisions are you making in this life?
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   Are they impacting your life in the eternity?
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   Discover.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   Have you discovered God?
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.800]   It says that there is no excuse.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   In this story, the rich man had no excuse.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:52.800]   In the passage in Romans, it says there is no excuse.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   God has revealed himself.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   Have you chosen to know him?
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   Or have you chosen to go against him?
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   And what is your life dependent on?
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   Are you dependent on riches?
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   Are you dependent on your social status?
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   How many likes you have?
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   Are you dependent on your house, investments, stocks?
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   Or are you dependent on the deliverer?
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   The deliverer.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:45.800]   The deliverer of our souls, of salvation.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   What is God convicting of you today?
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   Which D word is he speaking to you personally today?
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   Let's take a moment just to reflect, talk to the Lord.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.800]   Ask him to speak to you personally.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.800]   Let's do that for a moment.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   [music]
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   Heavenly Father, we come before you.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:45.800]   We thank you for the reminders in this parable.
[00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   That this life is not just the end.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   There is eternity.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   The things that we decide on earth have eternal weight.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   Help us to make wise decisions.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   To follow your spirit.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   Help us, Lord, to be good stewards of the things you have given us on this earth.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.800]   In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   Let us respond with this song.
