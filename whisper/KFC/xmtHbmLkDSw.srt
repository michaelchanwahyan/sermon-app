1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
 Good evening everybody and thank you Bonnie.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:19,780
 Famous French underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau said this, "From birth, man carries

3
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,160
 the weight of gravity on his shoulders.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:40,160
 He is bolted to the earth, but man has only to sink beneath the surface and he is free."

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:49,720
 Man has only to sink beneath the surface and he is free.

6
00:00:49,720 --> 00:01:00,080
 Two weeks ago I presented a new thing, a vision for 2022.

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,720
 I highlighted the area of emotional health.

8
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:14,680
 I said I believed it was the number one issue that was facing the church today.

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,800
 We didn't waste any time.

10
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:27,560
 We immediately kicked off our new sermon series, Health for All, All for God.

11
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,200
 On cue as it were, the new government restrictions almost advertised it for us.

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,280
 I bumped into a mum the other day and she had primary school pupils.

13
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,320
 I think I saw her five minutes after the latest announcement.

14
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,960
 She said, "This is going to drive us crazy again."

15
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:56,640
 Last week we had James' excellent sermon, The Place of Pain Experiencing Sorrow.

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,920
 It sets the scene for where we will be over the next eight weeks.

17
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,720
 You need to hear it.

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:15,200
 What I loved about James' sermon was its focus on biblical leaders, especially Jesus,

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:23,260
 and the three ways that enabled Jesus to deal with sorrow.

20
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,720
 It sets a role model for us.

21
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,280
 Firstly because Jesus didn't face sorrow alone, we shouldn't.

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,040
 Remember he was with Peter, James, and John.

23
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:45,520
 Secondly, because Jesus didn't hide his feelings, we shouldn't.

24
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:51,400
 You remember he said, "Father, if this cup can be taken from me."

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:59,200
 And thirdly, because Jesus didn't avoid the pain, we shouldn't.

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,400
 Remember he said, "Yet not my will, but yours be done."

27
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,920
 Please check James' sermon.

28
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,440
 It will shape our next two months.

29
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,200
 And I have a recommendation.

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:24,800
 Please join a clan and get buried into the accompanying study.

31
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,400
 Now let's turn to Luke chapter three.

32
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,360
 Now Luke's first three chapters are about Jesus' family, his origin, his birth.

33
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,320
 And then finally we read in Luke 3 23 this,

34
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:47,280
 "Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age."

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,600
 Now the word ministry is actually not there in the Greek.

36
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,400
 It actually says, "Jesus was about thirty years of age when it began."

37
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,840
 And it goes on, "being the son, as was supposed, of Joseph."

38
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,560
 And then we have a genealogy.

39
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
 You can skip it.

40
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,720
 Actually, the truth is we invariably do, right?

41
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,600
 Go right down to the end of the chapter and then we read that Jesus was the son of Adam,

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,880
 the son of God.

43
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,120
 Now look at this and Bonnie read it to us.

44
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,040
 And Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan.

45
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,560
 Now when he refers to the Jordan here, he's referring to the region around the famous

46
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,960
 river in Israel.

47
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:50,640
 He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness for forty days being tempted by the devil.

48
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,240
 He was hungry.

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,520
 Do you find that odd?

50
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:06,440
 He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness.

51
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,680
 Led by the Spirit into the wilderness.

52
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:19,600
 Now in the original Greek, the word that the ESV translates as wilderness is a word, "Eremos."

53
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,260
 I'll repeat that, "Eremos."

54
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,680
 Now a question.

55
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,980
 When you see the word wilderness, what image does it conjure up for you?

56
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,000
 Sometimes it's translated as desert.

57
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,880
 And we get visions, don't we, of heat and sand, just like the Sahara Desert, for instance.

58
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:53,400
 And that's misleading because the key point is it was empty.

59
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,360
 Nobody around for miles and miles.

60
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:09,000
 The word translated as lonely, isolated, deserted, and the best translation, I believe, is perhaps

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 the solitary place.

62
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 But why would Jesus, why would the Spirit take Jesus to the Eremos, the wilderness,

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 the solitary place?

64
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,520
 Because Jesus' clash with Satan was inevitable.

65
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:49,480
 He had a calling from God to succeed where Adam and Eve failed.

66
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:56,200
 As James told us last week, they failed in the Garden of Eden, where in a sense every

67
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,360
 human being in history, including you and me, have also failed.

68
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,240
 Jesus had to succeed.

69
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,000
 And here's the point.

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,480
 Most of us see the Eremos as a place of weakness.

71
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:27,960
 I mean, Jesus in the wilderness, 40 days without food, on his own, tired and hungry.

72
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:38,960
 But rather than the wilderness being a place of weakness, in fact, it's a place of strength.

73
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:48,960
 Let me say it again, rather than the wilderness being a place of weakness, it is in fact a

74
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,160
 place of strength.

75
00:07:52,160 --> 00:08:00,000
 Commenting on Jesus' temptation in the wilderness, author Dallas Willard wrote this, "Most to

76
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,960
 whom I have spoken about this matter are shocked by the suggestion that the wilderness, the

77
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,640
 place of solitude and deprivation, was actually the place of strength and strengthening for

78
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:19,760
 our Lord, and that the Spirit led him there as he would lead us there, to ensure that

79
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,520
 Christ was in the best possible condition for the trial."

80
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,760
 In that desert solitude, Jesus fasted for more than a month.

81
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:41,160
 Then and not before was Satan allowed to approach him with his glittering proposals of bread,

82
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,280
 fame and power.

83
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,280
 Only then Jesus was at the height of his power.

84
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:59,400
 And what we see throughout Jesus' life is that he sought the solitary place on a regular

85
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,960
 basis.

86
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:09,040
 We often read about Jesus slipping away, getting out in the middle of the night or at daybreak,

87
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,160
 not to pop down to the 7-Eleven, but to be in the Eremos.

88
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:22,040
 For example, let's skip down to the end of chapter 4.

89
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:29,880
 Most of chapter 4 is about what we would call a brutally long day in the life of Jesus of

90
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
 Nazareth.

91
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,760
 In the morning, he's preaching and teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum, casting out

92
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,880
 an unclean spirit.

93
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,080
 In the afternoon, he's healing Peter's mother-in-law.

94
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,280
 And then we read in verse 40, "Now the sun was setting and all those who had any were

95
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,000
 sick with various diseases were brought to him.

96
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,200
 And he laid hands on every one of them and healed them."

97
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,360
 We read he was casting out demons late into the night.

98
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,440
 And finally, finally, we read this.

99
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:18,440
 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desolate place.

100
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,160
 Now, can you guess what that is in Greek?

101
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:32,840
 Yes, it says that Jesus went into the Eremos.

102
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,840
 Now look at how Mark's gospel phrases this verse.

103
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,200
 It's slightly different.

104
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,520
 And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went to

105
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,520
 a desolate place.

106
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,800
 And there he prayed.

107
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,320
 There he prayed.

108
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,160
 Now let's read on in Mark verses 36 to 39.

109
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,480
 People were looking for him and trying to keep him from going away.

110
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,960
 Verse 36, "And Simon and those who were with him searched for him.

111
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,880
 And they found him and said to him, 'Everyone is looking for you.'

112
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,000
 And he said to them, 'Let's go on to the next towns, that I might preach there also.

113
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,760
 For that is why I came out.'

114
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:36,920
 And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons."

115
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,480
 So here's the thing.

116
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,480
 After a ridiculously busy day, he doesn't have a lie in.

117
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,400
 He gets up early in the morning.

118
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:58,680
 He goes out and maybe just a short walk to the Eremos, a solitary place, all alone in

119
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,760
 the quiet.

120
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,600
 And he is in prayer to God the Father.

121
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:13,240
 And he comes out of the Eremos with four things that I want to share with you now.

122
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,640
 The first thing he has is this.

123
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,360
 He has clarity about what he is supposed to do.

124
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,920
 He said, "Let's go on to the next town that I might preach there.

125
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,720
 For this is why I came out."

126
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,640
 Clarity.

127
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,560
 He said, "I'm not just sent to Capernaum.

128
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:39,400
 I'm also sent," other versions of the Bible says, "For this purpose, I was sent to Galilee,

129
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,400
 Judea, and eventually to Jerusalem.

130
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:51,600
 I have this crystal clear idea of who I am and what I'm supposed to do."

131
00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:00,720
 The second thing he has is this, the ability to say no to good things.

132
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,360
 Oh, people come to him and said, "Everyone is asking for you in Capernaum."

133
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,440
 And this is a great opportunity for Jesus.

134
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,200
 The team from KFCI visited Capernaum a couple of years ago.

135
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,520
 It is a strategic location.

136
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,880
 It's right on the major north-south trade route.

137
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,920
 We call it a gateway city.

138
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,240
 Do something amazing in Capernaum, word will spread.

139
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,960
 Jesus said, "Nah, I'm okay, thank you."

140
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:40,960
 He was aware of Oswald Chambers' axiom, that good is always the enemy of the best.

141
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,000
 Have you heard that one?

142
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,320
 Good is always the enemy of the best.

143
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,860
 He was aware that life is short and fleeting.

144
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,720
 You could only say yes to a short list of things.

145
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,480
 He was of course aware of the danger of busyness.

146
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:13,760
 Dallas Willard once called hurry the great enemy of spiritual life in our day.

147
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,200
 He said this, "You must ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life."

148
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,960
 I love this.

149
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,080
 Last year, I read a book by John Mark Comer, who has inspired this series.

150
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,680
 His excellent book called "The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry."

151
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,040
 I recommend it.

152
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,320
 Because in Hong Kong, our life is rush, rush, rush, rush.

153
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,560
 You see someone running for an MTR train and the next one's gonna be there in two minutes.

154
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,760
 Jesus comes out of the Eremos with clarity about what he's supposed to do

155
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,640
 and the ability to say no to good things.

156
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,000
 But the third thing he has is immersion in God's presence.

157
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,020
 Over and over in Luke's gospel, we read, I read it earlier, that Jesus was full of the Holy Spirit.

158
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,420
 He lived in 24 saturation with God.

159
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,280
 He was swimming in God's presence all day long.

160
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:27,480
 And finally, he comes out for empowering for God's work.

161
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,740
 We read, didn't we?

162
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,200
 He said to them, "Let's go on to the next towns that I might preach there also, for

163
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,080
 that is why I came out."

164
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:43,400
 And he went into Galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.

165
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:51,040
 He was determined to step out into everything that God had for him.

166
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,980
 So he goes into the Eremos, tired, stressed out, thinking about the thousands and thousands

167
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,720
 of people who want a chunk of him.

168
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,560
 But he comes out with clarity about what he's supposed to do, with the ability to say no

169
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:19,760
 to good things, immersed in God's presence, and empowered for kingdom work.

170
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,920
 Now a lot of us, and I'll be honest, I am the biggest culprit here.

171
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,580
 A lot of us are the exact opposite.

172
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:36,080
 Most of the time, instead of clarity about what we're supposed to do, we have confusion

173
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,480
 about what we're supposed to do.

174
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,780
 Instead of the ability to say no, we say yes to far too much.

175
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,480
 Instead of immersion in God's presence, we feel disconnected from God, like he is far

176
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
 away.

177
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,920
 And instead of empowering for kingdom work, we feel stressed out, on edge, runny on empty,

178
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,880
 even a little bit grouchy or grumpy.

179
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:16,880
 I'm just saying, maybe, maybe it's because we don't spend enough time in the Eremos.

180
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,240
 The French mathematician Blaise Pascal wrote this, "All man's misery is derived from not

181
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,600
 being able to sit quietly in a room alone."

182
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:37,560
 We have become experts at filling our lives with noise and activities.

183
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:49,440
 You and I have become expert, have been filling our lives with activities.

184
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,960
 Ouch.

185
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,120
 Now many of you will have heard about the spiritual disciplines.

186
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:06,480
 A spiritual discipline is a habit, something you do on a regular basis in order to live

187
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,880
 every moment of every day in awareness of God's presence.

188
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,880
 Spiritual disciplines are habits, practices, experience that are designed to develop and

189
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,660
 grow and strengthen certain qualities of spirit.

190
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:32,360
 As it were, build the muscles of one character and to expand the breadth of one's inner life.

191
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,520
 They structure the workouts which train the soul.

192
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:45,640
 Some spiritual disciplines are personal, inward exercises that are practiced alone.

193
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:53,240
 Others require interpersonal relationships and are practiced in community.

194
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,500
 My favourite book in this area, it shaped my life as a young Christian about 40 years

195
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:05,080
 ago was a celebration of discipline by Richard Foster.

196
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:12,000
 In it he says this, "The desperate need today is not for a greater number of intelligent

197
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,800
 people or gifted people, but for deep people."

198
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:24,700
 And there are various books that have been written about this subject and together they

199
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:31,080
 have a list of about 20 or so spiritual disciplines.

200
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:38,760
 But what I've seen, there are about five that consistently percolate to the surface.

201
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,040
 I've put them on the screen.

202
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:51,320
 They're silence, solitude, prayer, fasting, and meditation.

203
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,360
 Let's just look at them briefly.

204
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,240
 Silence is so difficult in Hong Kong, isn't it?

205
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,120
 And it's difficult for us extroverts, right?

206
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:10,960
 Silence is a world with no noise, no cell phones, no people, no traffic, no city.

207
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:20,200
 Solitude, you're all on your own, no friends, just you and the God who made you.

208
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,320
 Prayer, you are in dialogue with God.

209
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,480
 You talk to God and you listen to God.

210
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,440
 You're hearing God's voice.

211
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,200
 And we have some teaching available here at this church.

212
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,560
 If you want to find more about it, please write in and ask us.

213
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,880
 Fasting, going without food or something else, social media, for example.

214
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,520
 Again, we have teaching available on this.

215
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:54,360
 And meditation, what is God saying through his scriptures?

216
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,480
 But more than that, what is God saying through nature?

217
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,960
 Meditation is quite simply to open up your life to God.

218
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,920
 The truth is when we first read a book about spiritual disciplines,

219
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,840
 we want to start packing our bags and go to a monastery

220
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,400
 or hike up to Tai Ma Shan or Sunset Peak.

221
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,200
 And there is certainly time for this.

222
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,200
 I recommend places like Bethany in Cheung Chau.

223
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:34,080
 And we did see Jesus and we do see Jesus in the Eremos, 40 days without food.

224
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:45,000
 But in this story, the one I just read, Jesus goes to the Eremos for an hour or two in the morning.

225
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:56,080
 So it's not just a crazy mountain top experience, but something we can do every day.

226
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,520
 I want to encourage you, however you're wired, extrovert or introvert,

227
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:13,240
 whatever your schedule is, you set apart part of your life just for God.

228
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,920
 Phone off, no checking last night's sports results.

229
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,200
 Give God your first fruits, not your leftovers.

230
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:36,480
 Have a set place at a set time and make it non-negotiable.

231
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:45,880
 I said two weeks ago, Hong Kong people's favourite expression is, "I'm too busy."

232
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,200
 Let's for a moment talk about why you are too busy.

233
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,640
 Look at Luke 5, 15.

234
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,680
 "Yet the news about him spread all the more, so the crowds of people came to hear him

235
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,600
 and to be healed of their sicknesses."

236
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,800
 Jesus had gone viral.

237
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,880
 But look at verse 16.

238
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:18,760
 "But Jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed."

239
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,720
 Now you know what the Greek word for lonely places is?

240
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,640
 You guessed it, Eremos.

241
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,880
 On a regular basis, he was in the Eremos, he was in the wilderness.

242
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,400
 Now here's the thing, I'm sure Jesus was busy.

243
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:44,680
 I'm also sure that if you're busier than Jesus, you are not emotionally healthy.

244
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:51,280
 But Jesus made this a part of his life.

245
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,560
 And I think I can say that the busier that Jesus got, the more he got away.

246
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:04,840
 The more he got into silence, solitude, prayer, fasting, meditation.

247
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:11,840
 The truth is for us, for me, it's often the complete opposite.

248
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,360
 Life gets complicated, doesn't it?

249
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:23,040
 And the first thing that goes is the very thing that was the axis of Jesus' life and ministry.

250
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,360
 Could this be the reason that many of us are so emotionally unhealthy

251
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,560
 and feel so out of sync with God?

252
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,800
 The God we want to be with, but we see is far away.

253
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:45,280
 Could it be that one of the reasons we simply do not spend enough time in the Eremos?

254
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,040
 Now I know we're all wired differently, right?

255
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,480
 I'm a serial multitasker.

256
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,960
 My mum used to tell me when I was a schoolboy, right?

257
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,800
 I'd be at home trying to do my homework, right?

258
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,160
 But I'd be watching the TV, doing my homework and bouncing a ball all at the same time.

259
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,600
 It may be one of the reasons why I was always top at school for classwork

260
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,800
 and always bottom for homework.

261
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,760
 But however you are wired, we all need this.

262
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,440
 And I'm going to encourage you this week, I'm going to challenge you this week

263
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:31,080
 to find that space for silence, solitude, prayer, fasting and meditation.

264
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,400
 Away from people.

265
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,360
 I suggest noise cancelling headphones.

266
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,880
 Get your phone off.

267
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,680
 Not answering emails.

268
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,680
 Oh my goodness, WhatsApp groups.

269
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,480
 What is it with WhatsApp groups?

270
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,720
 Why do people send you WhatsApps at 11.45 at night?

271
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,520
 Wherever you are on the spectrum of introvert, extrovert,

272
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:06,280
 we all need the right balance between solitude and community.

273
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,000
 Solitude without community leads to isolation.

274
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,440
 We don't want that.

275
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,360
 That's why I said in our vision,

276
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:20,720
 we want every person in this congregation to be in a small group.

277
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,600
 But community without solitude goes by all sorts of names.

278
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
 Let me give you two.

279
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,800
 Anxiety, depression.

280
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,360
 And I know that from personal experience,

281
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:40,640
 having spent a chunk of 2020 and 21 taking antidepressants.

282
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,960
 I am therefore calling you to community.

283
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:55,120
 But in the same way, I am calling you to silence and solitude.

284
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,960
 It would be so easy for me to stop right here.

285
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,080
 But we can't.

286
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,080
 We're not done.

287
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,680
 Over the next few weeks,

288
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:15,320
 we will be looking at the principles of an emotionally healthy church.

289
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,680
 And the first one, the title of today's talk is this,

290
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,480
 look beneath the surface.

291
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,080
 Peter Sekiro in his book, in his Emotionally Healthy series, says this,

292
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,680
 "In emotionally healthy churches,

293
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,960
 people take a deep hard look inside their heart,

294
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,200
 asking what is going on that Jesus Christ wants to change.

295
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,720
 They understand that a person's life is like an iceberg

296
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:55,920
 with the vast majority of who we are lying deep beneath the surface.

297
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,480
 They invite God to bring to their awareness

298
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,560
 and to transform those beneath the surface layers

299
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:11,280
 that hinder them from becoming more like Jesus Christ.

300
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,360
 You can go to the top of a rock

301
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:21,680
 and still miss the stuff that is churning away beneath the surface.

302
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,920
 An iceberg is a huge chunk of ice

303
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:29,800
 that breaks off from a glacier and floats around the ocean.

304
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,280
 Most of an iceberg is under the water and can't be seen.

305
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,560
 And that's how a sneaky iceberg managed to sink the Titanic.

306
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,600
 But once again, Jesus is our template.

307
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,680
 Let's turn to Matthew 26.

308
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:52,200
 And let's end tonight where James started last week.

309
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,480
 Matthew 26, 36.

310
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,040
 "Then Jesus went with him to a place called Gethsemane.

311
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:06,320
 And he said to his disciples, 'Sit here while I go over there and pray.'

312
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,680
 And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,"

313
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,080
 that's James and John,

314
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,000
 "he began to be sorrowful and troubled.

315
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,480
 Then he said to them, 'My soul is very sorrowful even to death.

316
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,520
 Remain here and watch with me.'"

317
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,600
 Now look at this.

318
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,040
 "And going a little further,

319
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,360
 he fell on his face and prayed,

320
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,000
 'My father, if it is possible,

321
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,920
 let this cup pass from me.

322
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:53,520
 Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.'"

323
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:01,680
 So Jesus is in the garden with his three closest disciples, his buddies.

324
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:07,240
 And yet he still removes himself to a quiet spot.

325
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,480
 Now there's two things.

326
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,840
 He is aware of his emotions.

327
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,920
 My soul is very sorrowful.

328
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,520
 He was in touch with his feelings.

329
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,640
 And secondly, he understands why he has these feelings.

330
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,760
 Father, if it was possible, let this cup be taken from me.

331
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,080
 He is hours away from execution, from torture,

332
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:35,040
 from death, from rejection, from abandonment.

333
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,800
 And here's my point.

334
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,800
 These times of getting away to the Elamos,

335
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:49,000
 whether it was 40 days in the desert, miles from anyone without food,

336
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:59,640
 or a few feet away from his disciples in a park just outside the city,

337
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:06,480
 it wasn't time to read the Bible and pray, as good as that is.

338
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,680
 But for Jesus, it was also time to look beneath the surface,

339
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,280
 to get in touch with what he was feeling and to ask the why question

340
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,240
 and to bring it before his father.

341
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,760
 So what does that mean for us?

342
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:33,840
 Firstly, it is important that we have an awareness of how we are feeling,

343
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,680
 acknowledging and an acknowledging of what we are doing.

344
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,760
 But secondly, I must stress this, we've got to ask the why question.

345
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,160
 We need to say, "I'm really stressed out."

346
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,080
 Why?

347
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,280
 "I'm really on edge."

348
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,280
 Why?

349
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:01,280
 "Why do I feel I have to put another post on social media?"

350
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:10,280
 "Why do I feel so sad when I see other people on IG seeming happy?"

351
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,280
 "Why am I comparing?"

352
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,280
 "Why am I so critical of others?"

353
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:24,280
 "Why am I working hour after hour after hour to succeed?"

354
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,280
 Whatever that means.

355
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:35,280
 But invariably, we don't take time to ask why.

356
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:44,280
 Can I submit that one of the reasons we don't ask the question is that we are too busy?

357
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:50,280
 Another reason is that we are too scared.

358
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:56,280
 We are too scared to look beneath the surface.

359
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,280
 Sometimes we don't like what we find.

360
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,280
 It's too painful.

361
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:12,280
 Pain is sometimes God's way for getting our attention.

362
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,280
 I mean, when we pray, "God, take these feelings away."

363
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,280
 I've discovered He seldom answers that one.

364
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,280
 The reality is that God doesn't want to change our emotions.

365
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,280
 He wants to change our lives.

366
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,280
 He wants to deal with the roots of our emotions.

367
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:38,280
 And in that place, Jesus is waiting for us.

368
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:45,280
 In that place of pain, in our Gethsemane, as Jesus told us last week.

369
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
 My point is this.

370
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:53,280
 It can be terrifying to get away to the Alamos

371
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,280
 and to clear out all the noise and distraction,

372
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:04,280
 the latest Netflix series, the hectic social life, and to listen.

373
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,280
 To listen to God, oh yes.

374
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,280
 But also to listen to yourself.

375
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,280
 What is beneath the surface?

376
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:22,280
 To what you are feeling, to open your life up for Jesus to change you.

377
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:31,280
 And for you to realise what is causing the emotional pain.

378
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,280
 And my friends, here's the bottom line.

379
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,280
 Run to the Father.

380
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,280
 Run to the Father, just like the prodigal son did.

381
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,280
 Don't run away from Him.

382
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
 Don't run away from your issues.

383
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:59,280
 You will not solve them by getting busier, more meetings, activity, activity, activity.

384
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,280
 This is why the love of God is so amazingly powerful.

385
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:17,280
 In the midst of Jesus' emotional pain, what does he call God?

386
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,280
 My Father.

387
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,280
 My Father.

388
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,280
 In a few moments, Paul and the band are going to sing a song.

389
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
 We sang it earlier.

390
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,280
 We're going to be singing these words.

391
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:39,280
 I want to encourage you wherever you are to join in.

392
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,280
 It might be interesting if you're dialing in from the MTR.

393
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
 I run to the Father.

394
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,280
 I fall into grace.

395
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,280
 I'm done with the hiding.

396
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,280
 No reason to wait.

397
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,280
 My heart needs a surgeon.

398
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,280
 My soul needs a friend.

399
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:07,280
 So I run to the Father again and again and again and again and again.

400
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:15,280
 My friend, don't suppress your emotion.

401
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,280
 Be aware.

402
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,280
 Ask yourself why.

403
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,280
 I'm not promising anyone a quick fix.

404
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:34,280
 I'm not going to call you to the front if I could and lay hands on you and the whole thing is fixed.

405
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:39,280
 It is rarely as simple as that.

406
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,280
 But if you will do as Jesus did in his anguish, in his pain,

407
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,280
 he was literally sweating blood.

408
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,280
 If you will do as Jesus did and run to the Father,

409
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:05,280
 there you will find both a surgeon and a friend.

410
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:12,280
 I'm going to ask the worship band to come up now.

411
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:18,280
 But what we're going to do, rather than just rush into the song,

412
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:25,280
 is I'm going to invite everyone, whether you're here with us today, whether you're at home,

413
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
 we're going to take a period of silence.

414
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,280
 We don't do that very often in church, do we?

415
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:39,280
 This is not an excuse now to switch off and get on with your life.

416
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,280
 But actually, I feel this is very important for us as a church.

417
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,280
 So what we're going to do now is we're going to have a period of just silence.

418
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
 I'm not going to even pray now. We're going to have silence.

419
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,280
 And then Paul and the band will lead us in this song.

420
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,280
 And then Pastor Michelle will come up and pray for us.

421
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,280
 So let's just have this time of complete silence.
