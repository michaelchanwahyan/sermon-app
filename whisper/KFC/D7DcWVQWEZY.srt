00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
 My talk this evening as we kick off a brand new series is "Serving Satisfies Me."

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,680
 You're going to hear this next expression a lot.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,400
 I've put it on the screen.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,160
 Saved people serve people.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,920
 Let me repeat that.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,940
 Saved people serve people.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:41,720
 You don't have to be saved to serve, but I maintain that you do have to serve if you

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
 are saved.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,400
 I'll tell you where I'm going with this.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,560
 January 7th, 2023 was a difficult day for me to preach my first sermon of the year here

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,200
 at KFCI.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,560
 Firstly I was in the UK.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,080
 It was literally days after Sandra's father had died and we were busy clearing out his

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,000
 house and arranging the funeral.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,160
 My sermon was on video.

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,040
 I actually filmed it myself.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,080
 Bonnie tidied it up and added the slides.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,720
 If you remember, God gave me, I believe, three words.

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,200
 You remember this picture.

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,560
 Us, you and them.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,120
 A reminder by us, I referred to the pastors of the church.

22
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:42,880
 There is a call for us pastors to be ready for all that God wants us to do as a church.

23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,520
 By you, I refer to the congregation of our churches.

24
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,360
 That means recognising that all of you, all of you are gifted.

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,760
 That means us equipping you.

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:08,280
 That means proper training to allow you to be effective ministers of the gospel.

27
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,840
 And by them, I refer to the community.

28
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,280
 Those outside of our church buildings.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,880
 That means us being aware of the needs in our society.

30
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,560
 That means us being willing to get up of our church seat and do something about it.

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,400
 That means being trained and equipped to be able to do this effectively.

32
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:45,240
 Now Gong Fuk Church's vision for 2023 is this, equipping the saints, serving the community.

33
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,520
 Equipping the saints, serving the community.

34
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,400
 In response to this, we launched a five-week sermon series on equipping the saints with

35
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,960
 Johnny, James, myself, and you remember Pastor Seth.

36
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,280
 But we were only at half-time.

37
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,400
 And the half-time refreshments, as it were, were the One Campaign and the Parables of

38
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,820
 Luke.

39
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,800
 But the point is, it is good to be equipped.

40
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,200
 Indeed, very good.

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,320
 Indeed, essential.

42
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:32,600
 But only if equipping leads to service.

43
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,280
 Only if equipping leads to service.

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,680
 That is the 2023 vision of Gong Fuk Church.

45
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,920
 And this is vital as we as a church, as the big church, make preparation for our Gong

46
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:54,480
 Fuk Community Centre and the exciting opportunities to serve Hong Kong people emanating from the

47
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
 Southern District.

48
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,920
 And we'll be sharing more about this in the coming weeks and months.

49
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:08,400
 But remember, save people, serve people.

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,680
 And yet, many people talk about coming to church to be fed.

51
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,900
 You've heard the expression.

52
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:26,840
 They will feel they will be fully satisfied if they are fed.

53
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
 As I prayed this week, there's a picture on the screen.

54
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,760
 I sense a picture of a hiker.

55
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,560
 I think I was influenced by us being in Moi Wo last week for three days.

56
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:46,240
 Now this hiker had a rucksack full of food and provisions for the hike.

57
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:56,120
 But instead of that, he decided to eat and drink them before he started the walk.

58
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:05,280
 He was more worried about being fed than about the purpose of his journey.

59
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:15,520
 KFCI, church is not all about me.

60
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,920
 Jesus didn't come to be served, but to serve.

61
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:30,000
 When we follow Jesus as our leader and forgiver, we should serve others just as Jesus did.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,120
 After all, save people, serve people.

63
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,720
 I told you to hear that a few more times.

64
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,240
 Jesus was the ultimate example of service throughout his life.

65
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,000
 And our response to his love and grace should be lives spent serving him.

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,880
 I don't know about you, I find that I can twist the idea of service to be more about

67
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,840
 me than it is about the attitude of serving.

68
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,600
 One of the things I've noticed about serving in our current culture is that we tend to

69
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,760
 have an approach that's really more about us than it is about who we're serving.

70
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,760
 It's not a great look.

71
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
 Let me explain.

72
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,880
 I've put the headline up, "Selfish Serving."

73
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,240
 Often the narrative in my mind goes something like this, "I can't serve because I don't

74
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,320
 have the time.

75
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,520
 I don't know how to serve them.

76
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
 It's difficult.

77
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,000
 It's uncomfortable.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,280
 I don't like doing it.

79
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,720
 I'm really tired.

80
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:46,440
 I don't think I have the energy to do this and that."

81
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,720
 The problem with all of those statements is those statements are about me and what I get

82
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,640
 out of the act of serving.

83
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,440
 It's a backwards relationship.

84
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,880
 Ultimately, serving should be a sacrifice.

85
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:12,360
 When serving is not a sacrifice, is it really serving?

86
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,000
 Is it really satisfying?

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,340
 We're going to talk tonight about serving the Lord Jesus Christ as a person saved from

88
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:32,800
 our sins by his blood, as a person filled with his life-giving spirit as being fully

89
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
 satisfying.

90
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,900
 I want to look at a few verses from a famous story in John 4.

91
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,320
 We know it as Jesus and the woman at the well.

92
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,440
 The background we read is that Jesus was tired.

93
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,600
 He was fully human and he sat down by a well.

94
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:07,540
 We read, "When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, 'Will you give me

95
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,580
 a drink?'"

96
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,260
 Now this was all wrong.

97
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:23,580
 Jesus, a Jewish man, talking to a Samaritan, talking to a Samaritan woman, talking to a

98
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:31,620
 Samaritan woman with a past, talking to a Samaritan woman with a past who was there

99
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:40,820
 in the midday to probably avoid being seen by the village gossips.

100
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:47,220
 But you know it was not about a drink he needed.

101
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,320
 It was all about what she needed.

102
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,360
 We then witness a most, I can only say, a bizarre conversation about a drink that Jesus

103
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,940
 didn't really want from a woman who didn't think he should be asking her, leading to

104
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,700
 a discussion which interplays between the water from the well and this thing called

105
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,120
 living water.

106
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,020
 She says, "I don't know what this living water is, but it sounds like I should have some."

107
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,260
 Let's read a few verses.

108
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:26,540
 The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw water with and the well is deep.

109
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,460
 Where do you get that living water?

110
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,180
 Are you greater than our father Jacob?

111
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,580
 He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock."

112
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:45,620
 Jesus said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever

113
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:51,240
 drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again.

114
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:58,260
 The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal

115
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,260
 life."

116
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:10,620
 I guess what I'm saying is that the spring of water welling up to eternal life has to

117
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,900
 result in three key things.

118
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,340
 Firstly, it needs to result in love.

119
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,260
 The Bible tells us, doesn't it, you should love the Lord your God with all your heart,

120
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,780
 your soul, and all your mind, and wait for it, and love your neighbor as yourself.

121
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:36,060
 It has to result in growth.

122
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:40,860
 Through all the things that we spoke about in January, remember unity, community, word

123
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:49,180
 and witness, and last but not least, it has to result in action.

124
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:56,860
 Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these, my brothers, you did it

125
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
 to me.

126
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,860
 You did it to me.

127
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,580
 Yes, save people, serve people.

128
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,540
 Jesus said that if she drank the water from the well, she would be thirsty again in no

129
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:16,060
 time, especially in the midday humidity, and we knew that today in Hong Kong, didn't we?

130
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:24,020
 But Jesus said if she drank this living water, she would never go thirsty again.

131
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:31,300
 No wonder she ran to the city and proclaimed to them, "Come and see a man.

132
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,180
 Could this be the Christ?"

133
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,140
 This leads me to the passage that Bonnie read earlier.

134
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,460
 We know it as the feeding of the 5,000.

135
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:49,400
 It's actually the only miracle that is recorded in all four Gospels.

136
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:56,260
 But the custom of the time was to count heads of household, and Scripture tells us there

137
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,780
 were 5,000 men with additional women and children.

138
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:06,420
 So the final tally could be closer to 15,000 or even more.

139
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:14,980
 It is Mark 6, 13 to 44, and begins with the disciples returning from a mission trip and

140
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
 giving a report.

141
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,260
 I know Johnny will be taking a team off to Cambodia in a couple of weeks' time, and one

142
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,380
 of the highlights of the mission trip is when they come back with their report, right?

143
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,660
 What happened?

144
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,500
 We read in verse 30, "The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all they had done and

145
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,940
 taught."

146
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:42,540
 So many people were coming and going as a direct result of this outreach.

147
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:49,420
 Many had been saved, many had been healed, that Jesus said, "Come away by yourselves

148
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,620
 to a desolate place and rest for a while."

149
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,780
 For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.

150
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:05,380
 It must have seemed like paradise to the disciples, you know, down time after a mission trip.

151
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,940
 You know what it's like, right?

152
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,340
 I understand this.

153
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:14,940
 You put your feet up and at last can have a sleep.

154
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:22,740
 But the crowd just grew and grew and grew.

155
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,180
 The disciples weren't worried at first.

156
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,140
 They were resting on the boat.

157
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,940
 They were ready for 40 winks.

158
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,780
 But hold on, verse 32.

159
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:39,060
 "And they went away into a boat to a desolate place by themselves.

160
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,860
 Now many saw them going and recognized them.

161
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,540
 And they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them."

162
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,540
 Uh-oh.

163
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,900
 Now read on.

164
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:59,100
 "When he went ashore, he saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them because they

165
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,140
 were like sheep without a shepherd.

166
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,460
 And he began to teach them many things.

167
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,260
 And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, 'This is a desolate place

168
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,980
 and the hour is now late.

169
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,620
 Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves

170
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,540
 something to eat.'"

171
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,980
 Now there is an interesting Greek word that is used here for compassion.

172
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,980
 I love this word.

173
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,140
 Splagnitzai.

174
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:40,020
 It literally means to be moved as to one's bowels.

175
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,380
 A compassion in the most innermost place in my gut.

176
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:50,980
 The only time it's used in scripture other than regarding Jesus was the Good Samaritan.

177
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,340
 The disciples were thinking, "What a time!

178
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,220
 Jesus, what a time to have Splagnitzai!"

179
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,060
 Now wait for it.

180
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,860
 It gets worse.

181
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,140
 "But he answered them, 'You!

182
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,140
 You give them something to eat!'"

183
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,740
 Now on the face of it, the disciples' requests had been reasonable.

184
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
 They were tired.

185
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,100
 They were in a desolate spot.

186
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,740
 There was no Fairwoods or McDonald's there.

187
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:32,100
 Notice I didn't use KFC for obvious reasons.

188
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:40,860
 It was dark and the crowd was staying as long as Jesus was preaching.

189
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,740
 It sounded sensible and reasonable to stop the teaching and send them off for food in

190
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,580
 a nearby village.

191
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,620
 Reasonable.

192
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,260
 But Jesus' response sounded anything other than reasonable.

193
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,180
 He said, "You!

194
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,500
 You give them something to eat!"

195
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,740
 Prompting the disciples' somewhat sarcastic response.

196
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:17,220
 "Should we go and buy 200 denarii of worth of bread and give them to eat?

197
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,340
 That's half a year's wages!

198
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,420
 You want us to spend that much on bread for the crowd?"

199
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,140
 Then look at this.

200
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,140
 It's on the screen.

201
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,620
 He said to them, "How many loaves do you have?

202
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,580
 Go and see."

203
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:40,540
 And when they found out, they said, "Five and two small fish."

204
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,300
 Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.

205
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:51,260
 They sat in groups by hundreds and by fifties and taking the five loaves and the two fish,

206
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,300
 he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the

207
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,260
 disciples to set before the people.

208
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,300
 And he divided the two fish among them all.

209
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,620
 And they all ate and were satisfied.

210
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:15,460
 And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.

211
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,980
 I guess it's fish pie tomorrow, right?

212
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,220
 And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.

213
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
 Now some points here.

214
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,220
 It's a familiar story, I know.

215
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,620
 But at the same time, there's some lessons here about serving.

216
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,220
 Number one is this.

217
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,040
 Everyone is hungry.

218
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,420
 In this story, the disciples were hungry.

219
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,940
 They had no leisure even to eat.

220
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,940
 The crowd were hungry.

221
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,020
 He said, "Send them away into the surrounding countryside to buy themselves something to

222
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,580
 eat."

223
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:56,620
 Hunger here equates to lack of satisfaction.

224
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,860
 The crowd have left their home.

225
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:07,640
 They've left their food on the shelves because of Jesus.

226
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,720
 He was preaching.

227
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,000
 He was teaching.

228
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,120
 He was healing.

229
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:22,620
 The crowd had skipped meals because they were hungry for Jesus.

230
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,280
 They could go for days.

231
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,840
 Even the last month or so, we've seen congregations in places like Asbury just going on for days.

232
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:34,560
 Just because they were hungry for Jesus.

233
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:44,640
 God has created a hunger, a hungry man that only he can fill.

234
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,680
 So everyone is hungry, especially Johnny, by the way.

235
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:57,160
 Second point is you are invited to a miracle.

236
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,640
 You're invited to a miracle when you serve the Lord.

237
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,960
 You get front row seats to see unmet needs met by Jesus.

238
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,720
 This is grace.

239
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,820
 Verse 37, Jesus said, "You give them something to eat."

240
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,800
 This was a bit like our schedules here in Hong Kong.

241
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,200
 The disciples were maxed out.

242
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,000
 People in Hong Kong are so busy.

243
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,240
 People wear their busyness like a badge.

244
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,200
 I often ask people, "How are you?"

245
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
 You know what they reply?

246
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,880
 "I'm busy."

247
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,400
 Not the question.

248
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:59,800
 We can be so busy that we can miss the miracle.

249
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,240
 My third point is really three words.

250
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,440
 Blessed, broken, and given away.

251
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,200
 They're all in one verse here.

252
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,240
 They find the little that they have.

253
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,880
 In this case, it was five loaves and two small fish.

254
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,120
 I want to read it again.

255
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,640
 And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing

256
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,560
 and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people.

257
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,000
 And he divided the two fish amongst them.

258
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,400
 This represents for us a pattern of what he does for us.

259
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,920
 You say to me, "Pastor John, I've so little to offer.

260
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,280
 I can't sing, play music.

261
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,560
 I've never preached a sermon.

262
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,480
 I've never led anyone to Christ."

263
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,400
 Well, I've got news for you today.

264
00:20:51,400 --> 00:21:00,680
 Just as Jesus used a little boy's packed lunch to feed the multitudes with baskets left over,

265
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:09,360
 you offer him what you have and he will bless, break, and give away.

266
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,040
 Let's look at those three.

267
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,720
 Bless.

268
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,320
 Jesus blessed the bread.

269
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,080
 We read that.

270
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:21,000
 Jesus blesses us.

271
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,480
 Breaks.

272
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,720
 This is so important.

273
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,440
 Jesus broke the bread.

274
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,080
 Jesus breaks us.

275
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:39,000
 This is very hard, but so important that Jesus breaks us so that we're ready to be given

276
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 out.

277
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,240
 And then thirdly, he gives away.

278
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,960
 Jesus gave the bread to his disciples.

279
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,400
 He will use us to feed the multitudes with his love.

280
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,940
 Can I just expand that broken bit for a moment?

281
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,040
 As I said earlier, God breaks things in our lives.

282
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,440
 We all have things that God needs to break in our lives.

283
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,740
 Attitudes, bad habits, secret sins.

284
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,460
 But he also breaks our heart for things.

285
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,720
 What breaks your heart may be different to the things that break my heart.

286
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:26,240
 Don't we sing, "Break my heart for what breaks yours, Jesus."

287
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:40,320
 But when your heart breaks for them, it invariably means that Jesus wants you to do something.

288
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:47,740
 You'll have the privilege over the next few weeks to hear people who God has broken their

289
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:53,600
 hearts for the poor, for refugees, for those who are without sight, for the orphan and

290
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,100
 the unborn child.

291
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,060
 I'll tell you more in a moment.

292
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,900
 God is not looking for your excuses.

293
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:13,900
 I believe for everyone that's here, God wants to do something extraordinary in your lives.

294
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:28,420
 He wants you to offer him your ordinary.

295
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:35,820
 He will add his extra and make it extraordinary.

296
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,500
 I've put it on the screen.

297
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:48,960
 He takes our ordinary, he gives the extra, and he makes it extraordinary.

298
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:59,120
 My friend, over the next two months, and obviously after that as well, we want to encourage you

299
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,000
 to give what is ordinary for you.

300
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,200
 This is what we have in store for you.

301
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,680
 I've put the schedule up.

302
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:16,560
 What we'll be doing is this, is that every other week I'll be sharing from this series,

303
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:20,560
 and the intervening weeks we'll have some champions here.

304
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:28,800
 Next week, my birthday party week, just saying, we'll have Dr. Susanna Hoy from the Hong Kong

305
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,000
 Christian Network for the Poor.

306
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,020
 Those of you who don't know her, Pastor Peter is part of their advisory board.

307
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:42,080
 It's going to be a real treat for us to hear Susanna here next week.

308
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,320
 In three weeks' time, we have Green Matonga from Branches of Hope.

309
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,400
 She's working with the refugee and asylum seeker program there.

310
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,560
 Again, someone we as a church support.

311
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:59,840
 In five weeks' time, we're having Joyce from New Sight in Congo, just to have a look at

312
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,680
 what happens when we look at people who've, she's a Hong Kong lady and she's gone overseas

313
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,000
 to Congo, and she's dealing with people who have no sight in Congo.

314
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,960
 That's going to be quite incredible.

315
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,800
 And then lastly, Ali Amarwa, heirs from Mother's Choice, is going to be talking about the unborn

316
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,280
 baby and the orphans.

317
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:31,640
 Each champion will come and will be sharing ways that we can be involved practically.

318
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,280
 But I hear you say, "How do I get started?"

319
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,720
 Well, it's as simple as one, two, three.

320
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,080
 Number one, start where you are.

321
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,480
 Let me give you a place to begin.

322
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,760
 It starts where you are.

323
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
 Pick one household.

324
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,360
 I use the term household because I want you to think beyond just one person.

325
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,320
 This might be a co-worker.

326
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,400
 It might be another student in class, maybe someone or a family that lives in our apartment

327
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,600
 building.

328
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:14,960
 Just pick one household of someone disconnected from a church and where you see a need that

329
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,960
 can be served.

330
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:23,800
 Remember, we're talking about five loaves and two fish, something small.

331
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,880
 Don't wait passively for someone else's need to drop into your lap.

332
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:39,680
 Make an intentional decision tonight to pick one household of someone you know who is disconnected

333
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,100
 from a church.

334
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,160
 It starts there.

335
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:48,440
 Number two, pray for opportunity.

336
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,600
 Start regularly bringing the person or people of this one household before God in prayer.

337
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,680
 Remember, during Lent we started off the prayer for all, praying for five people.

338
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,600
 Continue to do that.

339
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,960
 Find someone who is on your heart.

340
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,120
 Continually pray for them.

341
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,560
 Particularly be praying for an opportunity to surface where you can serve the needs of

342
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,000
 this household.

343
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,720
 You're just praying for an opening to get into this person's life in a way that can

344
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
 help.

345
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
 That's all.

346
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,680
 Thirdly, and this is important, pursue relationship.

347
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:35,280
 However God answers that prayer for an opportunity to serve the needs of someone else in my community,

348
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,520
 take that as an opportunity for relationship.

349
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,160
 I've said this before about serving others.

350
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,920
 Nobody wants to be treated as a project.

351
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:56,120
 They want to be acknowledged as a person.

352
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:05,920
 You look for ways to bridge your actions of service into moments of relationship.

353
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,920
 Pursuing relationship communicates something.

354
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:16,080
 It tells someone else that they matter to you.

355
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:24,360
 In pursuing a relationship, I open the door for sharing to someone else that God loves

356
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:29,800
 them and that they matter to God.

357
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:36,320
 Because I love God, they matter to me too.

358
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,080
 God himself has provided all we need to follow him.

359
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,480
 He has revealed himself to us through his word so that we can know God and we can love

360
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,680
 God.

361
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,040
 He has established his church as a place in which we grow relationships of accountability

362
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,560
 to hold one another up in faith.

363
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,720
 And he has placed before us opportunities to meet the needs of those in our community

364
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,760
 so that we can share God's love and grace.

365
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,800
 Yes.

366
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,960
 Save people.

367
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,720
 Love people.

368
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,160
 But can I finish with a word of caution?

369
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:25,440
 Can I finish with a word of warning?

370
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:32,320
 Doing a sermon series on serving will not make us a serving church.

371
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:39,440
 Having guest speakers will not suddenly make us a serving church.

372
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:48,440
 Having a community centre does not suddenly make us a serving church.

373
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:56,680
 What we need, and we need it desperately, we need a culture shift.

374
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,400
 As I look out on this congregation, what we need to move away from is the same people

375
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,680
 who volunteer for everything while everyone else looks on.

376
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,960
 I'll say that again.

377
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,160
 I mean it when we ask for volunteers.

378
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:17,240
 We get volunteers but it's the same people.

379
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,320
 I want to give you a spoiler alert.

380
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,120
 How about that?

381
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:29,760
 Next week we will be sharing some simple opportunities for service.

382
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
 Nothing difficult.

383
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,320
 We'll be sharing.

384
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,360
 What I'm expecting is this.

385
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,240
 I'm expecting all of you to sign up.

386
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:49,360
 Yes, all of you.

387
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,440
 As you can tell, I'm restless about this.

388
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:01,040
 I am passionate for long-term change.

389
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:13,000
 As I ask the band to join me, we're going to be singing "There Must Be More Than This".

390
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,040
 And my friends, there is.

391
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:24,640
 And we are going to discover this together.

392
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:33,840
 My question is, will you join me on this journey?

393
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,480
 Let's please stand.

394
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:44,480
