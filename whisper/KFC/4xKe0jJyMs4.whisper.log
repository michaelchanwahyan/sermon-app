[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   So we're starting this, well, John started this series on judges last week and I get
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.520]   to carry on with it.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.320]   I'll be honest with you, I don't think judges really is my favourite book.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.440]   It makes me a little bit uncomfortable.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.160]   I look at the depravity of man, I see these idiots almost going around in circles in the
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160]   way they live.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.200]   But there's something uncomfortable about it, at least for me, is that sometimes I see
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.680]   myself in the book of judges.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.880]   It's a strange book, it really is a strange book.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.760]   It details a time where first you had Moses and Joshua take the Israelites into the Promised
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.040]   Land, the land of Canaan.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.200]   And then later on you have Israel where they have kings, King Saul, King David, King Solomon.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.120]   But then you've got this really awkward time in the middle where they get into the land
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.880]   of Canaan, the Promised Land of milk and honey, but for some reason they just can't get it
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.240]   right.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.600]   And they end up in this vicious cycle where they sin and then the enemy comes to take
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.240]   control over them and then they repent and then they cry out to God and then he delivers
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.160]   them time and time again.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.280]   And after that they're grateful for him so they worship him, but then they forget.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.040]   And then they forget and they slump down into sin and again they do evil in the sight of
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.360]   God and they're back round to the sinning again.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.840]   And it's a cycle that really frustrates me when I read it and then I realise that this
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840]   is in some ways part of my own life as well.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.240]   And just for a little bit more context, to understand judges you also really have to
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.160]   look into Deuteronomy.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.120]   You look into Deuteronomy where God is telling the Israelites, before you get into this Promised
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.320]   Land, look we've been wandering in the wilderness for a long time now, but we're nearly there.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.840]   But before you get in I need you to remember, I preached about this in the Cantonese service
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.120]   a couple of weeks ago, Deuteronomy 6, here at Israel I am the only God.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.460]   I am the only God that exists.
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.460]   Remember that.
[00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.640]   If there's everything else, if you forget everything else, remember that I am the only
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.280]   real God there.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.720]   What's even more than that is that you need to love me with all your heart, soul and mind.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.800]   What's even more than that, you have to have these commandments etched onto your hearts.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.120]   What's even more than that, you have to teach them diligently to your children.
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.120]   When you're walking around at home, when you're standing, everything, you have to teach all
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.800]   these to your kids because if you don't, they will forget.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.200]   And maybe not in your generation, but in the one after, they will forget.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.880]   And at some point they're going to start on this cycle.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.640]   And that's what Deuteronomy is, that's what God is telling the Israelites, do not, do
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   not forget.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.040]   But what do we see in judges?
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.760]   That's the very final verse of judges.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.160]   And everyone did as they saw fit.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.120]   Everyone did what they felt was right.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.160]   Later on, we have the wisest king ever, Solomon in Proverbs, telling them in chapter three,
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.320]   trust in the Lord, lean not on your own understanding.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.720]   Three verse seven, do not be wise in your own eyes.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.220]   Do you think you're wise?
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.220]   Do you think you're smart?
[00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.080]   Do you think you're street smart in this world?
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   Don't.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.320]   Do not consider yourself wise, but trust only in God.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.800]   But they failed to do that.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.000]   We failed to do that.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.520]   And that's why we're here talking today.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.560]   And the title of today is Two Unlikely Heroes.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.440]   We're going to jump into, look at some of these judges.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.080]   In the chapter three, there are three judges.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.440]   This Othniel is one of them.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.880]   And then there's Ehud and Shamgar.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.320]   We're only going to focus on two of them with the main focus on Ehud.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.120]   And what we see here then is in chapter three, we see this cycle being played out.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.200]   And I want to share four observations with you today in regards to this passage.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.440]   And the four is this.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.320]   The first one is that compromise often leads to demise.
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.560]   The compromise leads to demise.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.800]   Number two is repentance leads to deliverance.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.240]   But then, after that, we'll be looking at preparation leads to the action.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.800]   And finally, the humility that leads to the victory.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.960]   So we're going to be going through these four stages.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.640]   And we'll start with the first one.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.640]   Compromise leads to demise.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.000]   And I'll be reading from the ESV here.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.520]   Three, we'll only read a few verses just to start with.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   12 to 14.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.280]   "And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.520]   And the Lord strengthened Eglon, the king of Moab, against Israel, because they had
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.720]   done what was evil in the sight of the Lord."
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.200]   Verse 13, "He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites and went and defeated Israel.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.960]   And they took possession of the city of Palms.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.600]   And the people of Israel served Eglon, the king of Moab, 18 years."
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.000]   Eighteen years because they compromised.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.440]   That led to their demise.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.840]   See, God had given them very specific instructions.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.200]   When you go into the land of Canaan, this is what you must do.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.360]   Drive out everyone that is in there.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.800]   You must start again.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.680]   The people of Israel must be the ones that are completely determining the culture of
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.240]   this new land.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.380]   That is what you must do.
[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.040]   They had specific instructions, but they compromised.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.600]   They didn't drive them all out.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.760]   They saw some people and thought, "Hmm, that person's quite beautiful.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.520]   We should really take, I should really take her as a wife.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.840]   That person seems quite useful.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.800]   Do we really need to drive them all out?
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.360]   Maybe we will keep them to be our servants.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.920]   Maybe they will make us great."
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.280]   They compromised.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:40.680]   They had instructions from God, but they didn't follow it completely.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.000]   How good are we at following instructions?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.640]   I'm trying not to look at my wife here right now because I know what she would say about
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   me.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.000]   We've moved house lots and lots of times.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.560]   And one of the parts of adulting and moving house is what?
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.040]   Building IKEA furniture.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:07.200]   And so, time and time again, I've built so many Billy wardrobes over the years, but every
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.960]   single time I get something wrong, I think, "I think I know what to do here.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:13.960]   I think this one goes in here.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.960]   You know what?
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   Let's just skip this bit.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.960]   I think we know."
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.960]   And then, "Oh, it's okay.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   It's okay.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.960]   It's okay."
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.880]   And then suddenly, step 22, you're like, "This doesn't fit as well as it really should.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.240]   Oh, it doesn't fit."
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.200]   So I skipped a step.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.680]   And unfortunately, what that means is I have to take everything out and go back and realise
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.840]   I have to start again.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.000]   See, the Israelites, they thought they knew better.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.240]   They did as they saw fit.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.320]   They thought it would make sense to keep these people in the land.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.720]   But in fact, what happened there was that ended up leading to their demise.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.800]   Why?
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.880]   Because they started marrying their daughters, their sons, keeping the people in there.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.720]   What was the land of Canaan famous for?
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   Milk and honey.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.720]   It was a thriving land.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   It was a land full of potential.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.840]   It was a land full of distractions.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.160]   And see, the problem here is as they invited these other people from these different cultures
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:14.000]   to stay, they started to worship these other gods that belonged to these other cultures.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.120]   And that was where the problem began because suddenly, they weren't worshipping God, Yahweh.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.320]   They weren't focusing just on Him.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.800]   They weren't loving Him with all their strength and all their heart and soul and mind.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.320]   That became the problem.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.360]   They had compromised and that led to their demise.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:39.160]   And I wonder for us, why did God tell them and why does God tell us to only love Him?
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.840]   Just me, apart from the fact that He's the only real God.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.840]   But He's saying this, "You can only love Me because I'm the only one that won't corrupt
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   you."
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.960]   Children, look at me.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   Look at me.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.240]   I'm the only real God here.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.920]   If you look at anything else, if you look at anyone else's God, if you look at any other
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.640]   idols, if you chase any other worldly things, they will corrupt you.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.680]   They will consume you.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.800]   So I need you, child, to love me with all my heart because if you don't, then that will
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   be the beginning of your demise.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.160]   I think Hong Kong is a very similar place.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.960]   There are so many things that we love.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.240]   Johnny and I are well documented into loving our sneakers.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.440]   And I can be honest with you, that can consume me.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.880]   But I'm actually very over it.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.800]   I haven't bought a pair of shoes for at least two months.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.760]   It's been really good.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.760]   Thank you.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   Thank you.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   Repent.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:37.560]   Okay, so.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.240]   God is saying, "Look to Me."
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.880]   If you look at anything else, if you compromise even a little bit, it could take you down
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.880]   a road.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.640]   Just like a ship, if the bearings are even one degree off, it might feel okay at the
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.640]   beginning.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.160]   "Oh, if I just do this little bit, it's a little bit off course.
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.080]   It's a little bit different to what God says, but maybe it's so small it's okay.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   Maybe this screw doesn't need to go right here."
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.200]   Half an hour later, one day later, one week later, you're in a very different place, my
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:13.600]   friend, because you missed out this little bit, because you compromised right here.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.720]   So the question for us is, as we look at the Israelites and how they compromised, I wonder
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.120]   where in our lives we have also compromised.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.000]   What other gods have we taken on and adopted and chased?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.480]   Hong Kong is full of that.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.880]   There's power, there's finances, control, there's career.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.720]   There's all these things that you can chase.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.120]   I was having a conversation with someone who was, Hong Kong is ruled by the property market
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.600]   and the finance market, right?
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:43.360]   And I met this person who had climbed all the way to the top of the finance market.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.480]   He was right there at the top.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.360]   And he was like, "James, there was nothing there.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.920]   I went right to the very top.
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.920]   There was no one.
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.880]   There was nothing there."
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.240]   And then Tim Keller talks about this.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.120]   The worst thing that God can do to you is give you everything that you want.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.320]   When you make gods of other things, that's the worst thing that God can do to you, just
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.320]   give you everything that you want.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.320]   "God, bless me.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.000]   Pray that you let me have this job so I can have this career, this money, this wife, this
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.440]   family, this thing."
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.440]   And we let that consume us and that is the worst thing that God can do for us because
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.800]   we take our eyes off Him.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.320]   And we see this, not just from my friend, but also from Michael Jackson, from Elvis,
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.360]   from all these people who are right at the top of their careers, who are the famous,
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.600]   rich and famous.
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.520]   And yet you see, as soon as they reach the top, they realise nothing is there.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:40.280]   They realise the emptiness and they have to come back down because at some point, they
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.680]   have also lost their way.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.440]   Compromise leads to demise.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.720]   And these people brought their own destruction about.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.960]   They again did evil in the sight of the Lord.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.080]   And what did God do?
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.280]   He strengthened the Moabites and He connected the opposing forces and then they oppressed
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.360]   Israel for 18 years.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.240]   In some way, they brought about their own destruction.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:12.240]   It's interesting for me as I read this, don't you think, that God uses enemy empires, ungodly
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.400]   ones, to teach His people a thing or two.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   Isn't that weird?
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.360]   Isn't that something that maybe we have parallels to here, whichever side you're on?
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.160]   It's not really hard to find evil empires in this world right now.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.620]   But can you see that God isn't fazed by ungodly empires?
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.560]   God isn't fazed by all these kingdoms.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.080]   He looks above it all.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.640]   In fact, He uses those sometimes to bring us closer to Him.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.600]   That is His objective.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.120]   Not world domination, but soul salvation.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.960]   That is what God is actually looking at and He is willing to use anything and everything.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.680]   Proverbs talks about this.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.440]   God has a purpose for everything.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.360]   Even evil will be used by God for good.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.440]   Any system, any political system, any government, any leader can still be used by God because
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.340]   He is that powerful.
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:15.160]   That means that we should trust Him and we should listen to His instructions and follow
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.800]   Him, fear Him, because He is the one that is in complete control.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.840]   So what are the things that we have compromised on?
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.480]   What are the things that maybe we have followed our own wisdom on?
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.840]   That we look at ourselves and go, "I think we've got the right.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.560]   I'm a decent person.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.480]   I'm doing the kind of the right thing.
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.040]   I'm following most of the instructions."
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:43.200]   My word of caution in the most loving way is be careful not to compromise.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.560]   Follow all the things that God.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:51.900]   Love Him with all your heart, soul and mind because compromise leads to demise.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.400]   Number two is this.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:58.200]   Repentance, though, this is the hopeful part, leads to deliverance.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.320]   And that's where we carry on, verse 15, just one verse here.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:07.400]   "Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord, and the Lord raised up for them a deliverer,
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:13.120]   Ehud, the son of Jera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man."
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.840]   So we see here that it's never too late.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.120]   Even though there's these constant cycles, it is never too late that God is still merciful.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.880]   His mercies are new every single day.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.280]   That it is never too late to turn about.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.000]   One of my favourite worship songs growing up was called "From the Inside Out."
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.040]   A thousand times I failed, yet still your mercy remains.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.400]   It tells me that it is never, ever too late.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:43.760]   We can turn from our old ways and God will be there for us every time.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.760]   That is encouraging to me.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.480]   I don't know if it's encouraging to you.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.120]   But when we talk about repentance, we have to be truly serious and we truly have to mean
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.000]   repentance.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   What is repentance?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.280]   You do something bad, which we all do, probably on a daily basis.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.600]   Repentance isn't feeling guilty about it.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.720]   "Oh, that was, you know what, good people, good Christians shouldn't do that.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.380]   I just feel so guilty."
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.280]   That isn't really repentance.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.840]   Repentance also isn't shame.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.360]   It isn't, "Oh gosh, I did this.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.240]   What are the other people going to think?
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.160]   Gosh, they're going to look down on me."
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   It's not that either.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   It's also not fear.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.480]   "Oh my goodness, I did something bad.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   What is God going to do?
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.480]   He's going to punish me.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.480]   My parents are going to punish me.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   My parents are going to kick me out."
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.560]   It's not that either.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.960]   Repentance at its very core is us knowing that we've been heading in the wrong direction
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.520]   and turning around and choosing to follow God.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.600]   You see, there are very many different types of repentance and even selfish ones where
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.920]   we repent because we are afraid of what might happen to us.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.880]   So we repent not because we truly mean it, not because we truly want to love and follow
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:56.480]   God, but we repent because if we don't do this, it will lead to our demise.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.560]   There is a selfish level of repentance as well.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.620]   And that is what we, just like the psalmist in 139 says, "We have to ask God to search
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.880]   our hearts.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.560]   Even my repentance, God, can you purify it?
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.960]   I want my repentance to be real and true.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.240]   I want to genuinely turn from my old ways."
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.880]   And a part of that is deconstructing the things that we've done, removing the things that
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.600]   we've done, deconstructing the things that we've done, and then we get to the point where
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   we can truly repent.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.880]   And when we truly repent, then we get delivered.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.640]   And you see, you can do that.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   You're like, "That's all well and good.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.960]   I've repented before.
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.080]   But just like the Israelites, I keep going through these cycles."
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.680]   You see, repentance isn't a one-time thing.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.720]   Martin Luther, the theologian, says, "The life of a Christian is one of repentance."
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.080]   C.S. Lewis would call repentance "dying to yourself," and that's very biblical, where
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:55.240]   Jesus says, "You have to die to yourself, take up your cross, and follow him."
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.360]   Repentance, brother and sister, is a daily activity.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:07.280]   When was the last time you repented, genuinely, from your heart?
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.080]   See that is key here, because we have to make that decision every single day.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.880]   We have to choose to follow the Spirit of God every single day in order for us to be
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.520]   delivered every single day.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.400]   You see, if we don't have the Spirit of God inside us, then we won't have freedom.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.640]   We won't be delivered.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.760]   So therefore, we have to choose to follow him every day.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.160]   We have to consciously choose to repent.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:33.480]   And where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.520]   It is up to us to choose that.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.160]   It is up to us to repent.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:45.080]   So in order to get out of the cycle, the evil cycles, we have to make a daily choice to
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.040]   repent.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.560]   Repentance leads to deliverance.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.080]   The third point is this, preparation that leads to action.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.920]   This is where I have to read a little bit more.
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.600]   Verse 15 to 23, this is where the action happens.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.280]   Some of it is quite gruesome, but we're going to try and read it anyway.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.920]   15 to 23, "Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord, and the Lord raised up for
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.760]   them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Jireh, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man.
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon, the king of Moab.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length, about a foot, and
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.640]   he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.120]   And he presented the tribute to Eglon, the king of Moab."
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.240]   Now Eglon was a very fat man, useful detail.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.120]   "And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.160]   the tribute.
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.880]   And he himself turned back at the idols near Gilgal and said, 'I have a secret message
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.240]   for you, O king.'
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.440]   And he commanded silence.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.660]   And all his attendants went out from his presence.
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.440]   And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.640]   And Ehud said, 'I have a message from God for you.'
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.560]   And he arose from his seat.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.600]   And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.680]   it into his belly.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.680]   And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.680]   did not pull the sword out of his belly, and the dung came out.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.440]   Then Ehud went out into the porch and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.480]   locked them."
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.280]   You can see why Judges isn't one of my favourite books.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280]   That's pretty disgusting.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:27.040]   So he stabs him, kills him, leaves the knife there, probably tears a sphincter muscle somewhere.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.880]   Eglon loses control and it gets smelly.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.880]   And then he escapes.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.440]   It's an interesting one.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.840]   Let's start right from the beginning again.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.680]   Let's try and get out that last image on our heads.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:41.400]   Then the people cried out and raised up Ehud.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.120]   A left-handed man.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   A left-handed man.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   Who's left-handed here?
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120]   I've exposed myself.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.120]   I'm right-handed.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   Left-handed?
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.120]   Not many.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.120]   Apparently, you guys are very special.
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.120]   My wife is also a left-handed person.
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.120]   Apparently, left-handed people are always right.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   Apparently, 10% of the population are left-handed.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:14.120]   But apparently, left-handed people have a lot of advantages, especially in sports.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:19.120]   Actually, we all come from a culture where we favour the right hand.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.120]   Is there anyone here who was born left-handed but was forced by Chinese parents to become
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.120]   right-handed?
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.120]   Yes, yes, there are people.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.120]   Hands going up everywhere.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.120]   No, so yes, it is a thing.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:33.120]   So, left-handed people are alternative, let's say.
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.120]   They are unique.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.120]   They are different.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   In fact, as a science teacher, I can tell you that the left-handed people will use the
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.120]   right side of their brain more, and that's the side for creativity.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.120]   So, left-handed people are often a bit more creative.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.120]   Rafael Nadal, the tennis player, was actually a right-handed.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.120]   Well, he still is a right-handed, but he chose to learn how to play tennis with his left
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.120]   hand just to gain an advantage.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.120]   Basketball, Paulo Gasol was a left-handed player.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.120]   Everyone is used to each other being right-handed, so therefore, when you meet someone who is
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.120]   left-handed, it is different.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.120]   In the world of sports, it just becomes much harder to deal with because suddenly, something
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.120]   is going on.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.120]   Why is this person going this way and shooting this way?
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   Suddenly, there is an advantage.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:18.120]   Now, scholars here will look at this, and some scholars have said, actually, what the
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:24.120]   word means here is that he was restricted in his right hand.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   Maybe he was disabled.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   But actually, that is one theory.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:33.120]   But actually, if you go into Judges 20, you see that the Benjaminites, as a tribe, were
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   famous for being left-handed, and they were actually very skilled warriors.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:42.120]   So this was very interesting because normally, he must have been checked, just like we get
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.120]   thermometer checked going into Hong Kong Day Cafe right now.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.120]   But they get checked when they go in to meet the presence of the king.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.120]   And often, everyone is right-handed, so the sword would be held in the left thigh.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.120]   But yet, with Ehud, he is a lefty.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.120]   So therefore, he managed to hide it here, and he managed to get through the system.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.120]   And then, what we see here is then, he is prepared.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:12.120]   He prepares for himself a sword, a double-edged sword, a dagger that he gets to hide in his
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.120]   right thigh.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:20.120]   And then, he goes, and when opposing kings ruled over Israel, they always demanded tributes
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:25.120]   to confirm that you are still being loyal, that you are still being oppressed by them.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.120]   So every year, the Israelites would send someone to give them a tribute.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.120]   And Ehud had done his homework.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:34.120]   In fact, he gave such a big tribute, he had to bring helpers along with him to help him
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.120]   carry it.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.120]   And he must have given them a very compelling tribute that was believable.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.120]   And then, he says, I have a special message for you, King Ehud.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:47.120]   And of course, his tribute must have been so compelling that that completely disarmed
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   this very fat king.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:55.120]   And then, he gets to be in the secret chamber where he delivers, from his preparation, into
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.120]   action and execution.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:06.120]   Now, we look at this story, and I'm not trying to condone or even admire Ehud's plot to murder
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.120]   this fat man.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:12.120]   This is not an instruction manual on how to kill fat kings.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:18.120]   But rather, what we see here is that Ehud was someone who was prepared.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.120]   He was prepared, he knew what he was doing, and he was willing.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   When we were looking through the book of Esther, I'd said that God uses imperfect people to
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.120]   carry out his perfect plan.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:35.120]   Here, what we see is, we don't know much more about Ehud, is that God is willing to use
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.120]   people who are willing.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.120]   God is willing to use people who are willing.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:44.120]   And we see in the book of Judges that these people, these judges are not perfect people.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   And they do things that are really not that pleasing.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:54.120]   Yet, what we see here, and to bring about his will, is that God is willing to use people
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.120]   who are willing.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   My question to us is, how willing are we?
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.120]   How prepared are we to follow God's will, to serve God?
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.120]   And God often asks you to make your own tools.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:10.120]   Ehud here had to make his own sword.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.120]   He had to be prepared.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.120]   Now, thankfully, I don't think God's going to be asking any of us here to be killing
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.120]   any kings anytime soon.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:24.120]   But what we do see in Scripture is that our battle is not against flesh and blood.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:29.120]   Our battle is against rulers and authorities that are beyond this world.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.120]   And Ephesians 6 goes on to tell us how we have to be prepared.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:38.120]   In order to be able to face up to the action, we have to be prepared.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.120]   We have to take on the whole armour of God.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.120]   And what's our sword?
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.120]   What's our double-edged sword?
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:48.120]   The sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   That's what Ephesians 6 says, right?
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.120]   The sword of the Spirit is the Word of God.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.120]   So my question really becomes, how prepared are you?
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.120]   It really is asking, how much do you know the Word of God?
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.120]   We are in battle right now.
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.120]   Darkness is surrounding this world.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:09.120]   I don't think it takes me needing to tell you that for you to know that.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.120]   You can watch Fox News and you'll be able to see that.
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.120]   We are in battle.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.120]   How armed are you?
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.120]   How prepared are you with the Word?
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.120]   Now, we hear this all the time, and sometimes I've said it.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:27.120]   I'm not really a Bible kind of person.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   I don't really know the Word of God that well.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.120]   I don't know where to quote scriptures.
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.120]   Maybe that is you.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.120]   Now, I'm not asking you to remember exactly where scriptures are coming from.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:43.120]   But this is the instruction manual that God passed down to us.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.120]   This is it.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:49.120]   We're all asking, what do we do in this world right now?
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.120]   Surrounded by all this darkness.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.120]   What do we do?
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.120]   What do we do?
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.120]   How can we live?
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.120]   It is here.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.120]   We have to take on the whole armour of God.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.120]   We have to hold up the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.120]   How well do you know this Word?
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:07.120]   Now, I know it's hard.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:11.120]   As I've just shared with you, judges, it's hard to read.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.120]   But there are other parts that are a little bit easier to start with.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.120]   But we believe that this whole book carries power.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.120]   And if there is going to be hope in this world, it will be because there are believers,
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:26.120]   brothers and sisters, you and me, who are so in tune with this Word,
[00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.120]   that we know what to do from here.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.120]   We know what Jesus would do.
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.120]   Those of us who have found what would Jesus do, we know because we can read it.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.120]   Because we can see it.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.120]   We need to spend time with God.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:40.120]   We need to be prepared in the Word of God.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.120]   In order to, whenever he calls us to action, we will not only just be willing,
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.120]   but we will be able, just like Ahud.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.120]   Preparation leads to action.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   And finally, humility that leads to victory.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.120]   Verse 26 to 30.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.120]   Ahud escaped while they delayed.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.120]   So, he kills him.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.120]   He closes the door because it was just the two of them.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.120]   He sneaks away.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.120]   The king's guards, they wanted to respect the privacy, so they don't find out for a while.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.120]   Gives Ahud time to escape and leave.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.120]   And verse 26, Ahud escapes while they delayed.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   And he passed beyond the idols and escaped to Sira.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.120]   When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:25.120]   When the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.120]   And he said to them, key sentence here.
[00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:34.120]   And he said to them, "Follow after me, for the Lord has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand."
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.120]   So, they went down after him and seized the forts of the Jordan against the Moabites
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   and did not allow anyone to pass over.
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   Finally, no compromise.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:47.120]   Verse 29, "And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.120]   Not a man escaped.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   So, Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel, and the land had rest for 80 years."
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   Because of Ahud's preparation and action, he saved them from 18 years of oppression
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:06.120]   and the land was peaceful for 80 years, until the next cycle.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:12.120]   But what we see here, that is very interesting, is even though Ahud was key to this plan,
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:20.120]   he prepared, he made his own equipment, he acted it out smoothly, effectively.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.120]   When he goes back and he calls the rest of the guys, "Hey, it's time."
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.120]   What does he say?
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:28.120]   Did he say, "Hey, I did it.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.120]   It was me. I managed to do it all. I'm going to rescue you."
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.120]   He didn't.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:39.120]   He said, "Follow me, for the Lord has given your enemies into your hand."
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   He still attributed it to God.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   So, even though he did all the work, you could say, and he prepared himself,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:51.120]   he still called the rest of the people and said, "Follow me, for God has rescued you.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   God has delivered you."
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.120]   That is the humility that leads to victory.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.120]   That where he knew that he did everything that was possible on earth,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.120]   he could have only done it because the Spirit of God was with him.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   That was the humility that led to the victory.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:11.120]   So, we see here, God is willing to use willing people.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:18.120]   We see the story of Judges is all about the cycle that we have of the Israelites being fickle and forgetting.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:24.120]   But we also see God's mercies being you and granting a way out, a deliverer.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:28.120]   But really, the story of Judges is not really about the Judges at all.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   In fact, the story of the Bible is not really about all the different characters in the Bible at all.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:40.120]   The story of the Bible or the history of mankind, you could say, is the story of God.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:44.120]   History is his story.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   This isn't about us.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.120]   This isn't about Ehud.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   This isn't about Ehud being a hero.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   This is about God's heart and love for the people.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   He's demanding that we love him with all our heart, soul and might because he first loved us.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.120]   This is, his story is his love story to us.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.120]   And we see that with the final one, because the title of this topic talk is
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.120]   "Two Unlikely Heroes", but I've only really spoken about Ehud.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:14.120]   And verse 31 is where I want to share with you the final one.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:21.120]   Poor guy gets to share a chapter with Ehud, but he gets one verse.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:28.120]   And after him was Shamgar, the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines with an ox goad,
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:34.120]   which is like a metre long spear that farmers would use to guide the oxen.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   And he also saved Israel.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.120]   Alright, that's it.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:47.120]   This other guy gets like 20 something verses and I get one.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   But that's the thing.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.120]   Judges isn't about the judges.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.120]   Judges is about God.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   And what we see here is God is willing to use people who are willing.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   And so what we see here is Shamgar who had an ox goad, so he was a farmer.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:06.120]   And so there must have been some kind of battle that he had to be faced with,
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   completely unprepared because he was on his own.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.120]   And he was probably just minding his own business, working on his farm.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:17.120]   And the Philistines come and he kills 600 of them with whatever was in his hand at the time.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:23.120]   God is willing to use whoever is willing and he will equip you with whatever you have right now
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   and that will be enough.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.120]   And his grace will be sufficient and his power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   Are you willing?
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.120]   Are you willing to completely be faithful in whatever God has called you to?
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.120]   Here Shamgar was on his farm.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:43.120]   Ehud was raised up to be a deliverer, but where are you placed?
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.120]   Just like the book of Esther, where has God placed you?
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.120]   And what has he given you?
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.120]   What can you grab right now if battle was to ensue?
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.120]   God will use you if you are willing.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   He will.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:01.120]   We have to be willing, we have to be humble and we have to be prepared.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.120]   And if we're willing to do that, then we can play a part in this story.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.120]   Maybe we will get one verse.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:15.120]   If you got one verse in the Bible about you, what would it say?
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:20.120]   If you were lucky enough for God to include you in the Bible for one verse,
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:25.120]   what would it say about you, Julian, Gabriel, Rachel?
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.120]   What would that verse be describing what you did?
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:35.120]   But not really what you did, but what God did through you.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:41.120]   Because what we see here is that God used Shamgar in whatever capacity that he was used to,
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:46.120]   in whatever arena he was in, and that was enough.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.120]   Because the story of judges isn't about the judges, the book of the Bible isn't about us,
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:58.120]   it is about the one who did come to save us once and for all.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:02.120]   Now, because of him, there is no need for any other judges.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:09.120]   One guy came 2,000 years ago and he became our judge and our advocate.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:14.120]   He was completely prepared. He was completely prepared to do what he had to do.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   He himself had a double-edged sword.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:27.120]   And he executed it perfectly, one side sacrificing himself and the other side sacrificing the enemy.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:34.120]   And he managed to sneak in this weapon. He managed to defeat death through death itself.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:39.120]   The book of the Bible, our lives are all about this one guy.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   This one guy who was willing to humble himself, and it was when he humbled himself,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.120]   when he didn't count equality with God as something to be grasped,
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.120]   and came down to earth, snuck in this weapon and defeated death.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   And then, because of that humility, leads us all into victory forever,
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:01.120]   so that there is no more need for any cycles anymore.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:08.120]   Do you believe that you are eternally freed from the cycles that you are facing right now?
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   Those things that you have going on in your mind, those fears, those anxieties, those sins,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   do you believe, brethren and sisters, that they are simply you walking through the valley of the shadow of death?
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.120]   They are shadows.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:29.120]   You have the Spirit of the Lord in you and therefore you are free.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   Because of who? Jesus.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:42.120]   Because Jesus was the one who came to save us, to judge us as well, but also become our advocate.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:46.120]   And that's the story of Ehud and Shamgar.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:52.120]   And just to summarise, it was the compromise that led to their demise.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:57.120]   It was repentance that ultimately led to their deliverance.
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.120]   It was their preparation that led to action.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   And finally, it was their humility that led to the victory.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.120]   So what are we to do here?
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.120]   We are also to not compromise.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:17.120]   Not compromise and follow God and follow Jesus and love Him alone.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:25.120]   We choose to repent every single day of our lives, every single day, to follow Him.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:33.120]   And be prepared, be armed with the sword of the Spirit, be armed with the Word of God as we face the battles that we have.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.120]   And also remember that it is not about us.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.120]   To humble ourselves before the One who did give it all.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   And it's by His blood that we are saved.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.120]   The final, ultimate judge that became our advocate.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:59.120]   Brothers and sisters, be encouraged that you may feel as though you are one of the characters in the book of Judges that has these constant cycles.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.120]   But Jesus has come to save you.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.120]   And now He's asking you to follow Him.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.120]   Shall we pray?
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:23.120]   Father in heaven, we come before you and we know that we only really know you because of your Son.
[00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.120]   For Jesus, for what He did for us.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:31.120]   So we humble ourselves before you and first of all we ask for your forgiveness.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:41.120]   And we repent that you've given us this instruction manual, yet we have time and time again compromised, taken it for granted.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:49.120]   And we wonder why when we are faced with chaos and pain, we're not really sure what to do.
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:36:00.120]   And so Lord I pray that you will grant us the heart to yearn, to read your Word, to know you more, to be in tune with your Spirit.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:08.120]   So that we can take up your whole armour and fight this battle.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.120]   And Lord we know that you only use willing people.
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:26.120]   And so I pray that even in this room right now that you are raising up willing people with whatever tools you have given them.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:36.120]   And Lord we humble ourselves before you and we are grateful that the victory is already won.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:45.120]   That even when we are surrounded by darkness, when we see no way out, Lord we know that you are with us.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   That this valley that we're in is merely just a valley that we are passing through.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   That there is no foreign force that can control us.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:04.120]   There is no worldly thing that can oppress us and consume us and corrupt us.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   So long as we remember that you alone are God and that we love you with all our heart, soul and mind.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:18.120]   And so Lord help us do just that.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:24.120]   And Lord may we stand with joy in our hearts.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.120]   That the battle is yours.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.120]   And the victory is yours.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   And that you've shared it with us.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.120]   We thank you God that you keep your promises, that you are ever faithful.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.120]   That even when we see no way, you make a way.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.120]   Thank you.
