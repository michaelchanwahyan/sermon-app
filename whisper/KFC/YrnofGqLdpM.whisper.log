[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.240]   Good evening KFCI. I'm sad to not be with you in person. Sandra and I are in the UK
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.240]   with her father who is sick. We've been so grateful for your love and your prayers. Thank
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:29.960]   you KFCI. Bonnie told us last week that Advent, the season we find ourselves in, means coming.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.920]   That begs the question, who is coming? Of course the answer is Jesus. And what are we
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:48.080]   to do? We are to get ready. Between now and Christmas we will be taking a hard look and
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:56.760]   hopefully a fresh look at the story of Christmas. To see Jesus as the hope for the world. The
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   only hope at a time when hopelessness seems to be the prevailing message in today's world.
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:16.740]   I have my own definition of Christmas. I put it on the screen. Somebody became nobody so
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:29.940]   that nobody's could become somebody's. Let me say that again. Somebody became nobody
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:37.920]   so that nobody's can become somebody's. I want to pick up on James's excellent point
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.900]   from last week. James pointed out that the main point of Christmas was not a baby in
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.860]   a manger in Bethlehem. He encouraged us to look at Christmas through the lens of a bloody
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:01.460]   cross at Calvary. And even more than that, through the resurrection, a tomb that is empty
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:11.700]   to this very day. The King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the High King of Heaven, somebody
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:20.480]   swapped his heavenly home for a dirty old manger in a filthy stable and died the horrific
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:36.140]   death of a common criminal to defeat the power of death once and for all. But why? Why? Well,
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:49.380]   so that this nobody, a sinner represented by the thief on the cross with Jesus, could
[00:02:49.380 --> 00:03:00.740]   become somebody, could become a child of God, a son of the King. And I guess as I'm in UK
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:10.900]   now, a member of the Royal Family. The wonder of Christmas is this. The God chooses nobody's
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.940]   like you and me and through the life, birth, death and resurrection of his son, we can
[00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:31.300]   become somebody's if and only if we are prepared to accept what he has done for us. One of
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:42.820]   the best examples of a so-called nobody was Mary. Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, was
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:51.020]   a young girl, probably only about 12 or 13 years old when the angel Gabriel came to her.
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.820]   She had recently become engaged to a carpenter named Joseph. Mary was an ordinary Jewish
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:13.980]   girl looking forward to marriage. Suddenly, her life changed forever. Fearful and troubled,
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.920]   Mary found herself in the presence of the angel Gabriel, listening to his announcement.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.540]   We read this, "And he came to her and said, 'Greetings, O favoured one, the Lord is with
[00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.880]   you.' But she was greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greeting
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:45.540]   this might be." Mary could never have expected to hear the most incredible news that she,
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:56.020]   a virgin, would have a child and her son would be the Messiah. I mean, how would you feel?
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.240]   Verse 30, "And the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found faith
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:10.520]   with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:20.880]   his name Jesus.'" Although she couldn't comprehend how she would conceive the Saviour, she responded
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:30.560]   to God with humble belief and obedience. Although Mary's calling held great honour, it would
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.880]   demand great suffering too. There would be pain in childbirth, there would be pain in
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:46.240]   motherhood, as well as the privilege of being the mother of the Messiah.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:53.680]   The angel told Mary in Luke 1:28 that she was highly favoured by God. The phrase simply
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:06:01.280]   meant that Mary had been given much grace or unmerited favour from God. But even with
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:09.880]   God's favour, Mary would still suffer much. Although she would be honoured, highly honoured
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:17.760]   as the mother of the Saviour, she would first know disgrace as an unwed mother. She nearly
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:26.920]   lost her fiancÃ©. Her beloved son was rejected and cruelly murdered. Mary's submission to
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:35.460]   God's plan would cost her dearly. Yet she was willing to be God's servant.
[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:42.760]   God knew that Mary was a woman of true strength. She was the only human being to be with Jesus
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:56.240]   throughout his entire life, from birth until death. She gave birth to Jesus as her baby
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:03.760]   and watched him die as her saviour. Can I repeat that? She gave birth to Jesus as her
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:12.880]   baby and watched him die as her saviour. Mary also knew the scriptures when the angel appeared
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:20.120]   and told her the baby would be God's son. She replied this, "Behold, I am the servant
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:29.680]   of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word." She knew of the Old Testament
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:48.160]   prophecies about the Messiah. Poor and female, you might say three strikes. These qualities
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:56.280]   made her unsuitable in the eyes of people to be used mightily of God. A nobody, you
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:05.640]   might say. But God saw Mary's trust and obedience. Typically not the qualifications that humans
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:14.240]   consider important. God will often use the most unlikely candidates to serve him. I know
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:22.440]   one of them. But what lessons do we learn from this? Most importantly, Mary was willing
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:29.280]   to submit her life to God's plan no matter what it would cost her. Obedience to the Lord's
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:37.400]   will meant that Mary would be disgraced as an unwed mother. Surely she expected Joseph
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   to divorce her, or worse yet, he might even have her put to death by stoning as the law
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:53.920]   permitted. Mary may not have considered the full extent of her future suffering. She may
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:09:02.880]   not imagine the pain of watching her beloved son bear the weight of sin and die a terrible
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:10.520]   death on the cross. But surely she knew that her life would hold many sacrifices as the
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:17.960]   mother of the Messiah. Being chosen by God for a high calling requires total commitment
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:24.800]   and a willingness to sacrifice everything out of love and devotion to one's Savior.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:33.520]   For Mary said, "Behold, I am a servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.760]   word."
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:43.200]   We sang, didn't we, "Mary, Did You Know?" Originally written as a Christmas play script
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:52.380]   by Mark Lowry in 1984. "Mary, Did You Know?" is a series of questions all aimed at asking
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:10:01.480]   pregnant Mary various things about her soon-to-be-born son, the Messiah. I counted 17 questions,
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:09.000]   ranging from if she knew that her baby was God himself, to questions about his miracles.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.480]   To answer the question, "Mary, Did You Know?" poses, yes, Mary knew. Mary knew she was having
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:29.880]   God's son. Luke 1, 30-33, 35 says this clearly, "And the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid,
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:35.240]   Mary, for you have found faith with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:41.200]   bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:48.400]   of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him to the throne of his father David. And
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:55.800]   he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom there will be no end.' And
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:02.200]   the angel answered her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:09.800]   will overshadow you. Therefore, the child to be born will be called Holy, the Son of
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:19.880]   God.'" Yes, I think we can say that Mary knew that her baby boy was God himself. Even
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:25.680]   easier to answer is whether Mary consented to bear the Son of God. Her response on the
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:32.120]   subject was, "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord. Let it be to me according to your
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:43.800]   word." But Mary has her own Christmas song. History has given us a far more beautiful
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:50.760]   and accurate song for Christmas about Mary, one that actually confesses the truth about
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.920]   her, God's plan and that tiny baby. That song is the one that Mary herself sang, and
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.560]   it's one that churches around the world still regularly sing, the Magnificat or Song of
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:12.440]   Mary. And we had it read to us earlier, of course. "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:19.800]   spirit rejoices in God my Saviour, for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:26.700]   For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed, for he who is mighty has
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:32.640]   done great things for me, and holy is his name, and his mercy is for those who fear
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.400]   him from generation to generation. He has shown strength with his arm. He has scattered
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.920]   the proud in the thoughts of their hearts. He has brought down the mighty from their
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:50.520]   thrones and exalted those of humble estate. He has filled the hungry with good things,
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:56.040]   and the rich he has sent away empty. He has helped his servant Israel in remembrance of
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:05.760]   his mercy, as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his offspring forever."
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:16.040]   This leads me to reflect on this question. Am I, like Mary, willing to accept God's plan
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:25.080]   no matter what the cost is? Can I go a step further and rejoice in that plan as Mary did,
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:32.880]   knowing it would cost me dearly? Coming back to our song, of course Mary knew.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:42.600]   The question we should be asking, rather than "Mary, did you know?" is "Do we know?"
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:50.300]   Do we know? Could we sing Mary's song? How do we respond to God in our lives and in the
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:56.920]   world around us? Because while we wait for the birth of Jesus at Christmas, it is not
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:03.820]   because he isn't present with us now. The God who chose to dwell among us is with us
[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:13.880]   still yesterday, today, and for all our tomorrows. Do we feel Christ in our heart? Do we recognize
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:22.040]   the Holy Spirit at work in our lives? Advent is a time of preparation, and perhaps this
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:31.340]   week we can all, all of us at KFCI, can commit to looking, listening, feeling God's presence
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:39.700]   still dwelling among us. So I ask you to try a little experiment. Every
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:48.140]   morning as you prepare for the day, say to yourself, as Mary did, "Today I will encounter
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:56.620]   God and my soul will magnify Christ." And as you go through the day, look for Christ
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:02.820]   in the eyes of those you meet. Listen for the Spirit deep in your heart and try and
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:09.300]   feel God's love and grace in the world around you, because Christ, the Holy Spirit, God
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:13.580]   is there. And at the end of the day, just before you
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:20.860]   turn into bed, reflect back on all you've experienced. The good and the difficult, the
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:27.260]   joyous and the stress-filled. Was there something that struck you? Maybe a child's smile, maybe
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:33.500]   the eyes of a street sleeper, the song of a bird in the tree, a kind word of gesture,
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:40.820]   or perhaps even just a moment of stillness amongst the clutter of Hong Kong life.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:50.680]   The thing is, every day is a God-filled day, and we too are called by God to a Magnificat
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:16:01.900]   of our own. We are called to magnify the Lord, our Christ, and rejoice, for God is with us.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:09.340]   Now what does that mean? Well, we may not be giving physical birth to the Christ child,
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:18.900]   even you, Michelle, but we are giving birth to Him in the lives of all we encounter, if
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:29.700]   we magnify Him in our soul. And the crowning glory of it all is if we do this, we, KFCI,
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:36.260]   may just end up being the Church, the Body of Christ we are called to be. We will be
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:44.220]   joyous, good stewards of God, servants of the Most High. And then, the hungry will be
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:50.260]   fed, the thirsty given drink, the poor lifted and the stranger welcomed, the prisoner and
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.960]   the sick will be visited, and the dream of God for us all, for all the earth, will be
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:17:05.900]   ever closer to reality. Then we will all sing our own song of God's presence in our lives.
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:16.980]   The pop music world asks, "Mary, did you know?" We say, "Of course she did!" But the question
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:30.660]   we should ask is, "Do we?" Do we? Mary said, "Behold, I am a servant of the Lord. Let it
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:44.580]   be to me according to your word." Can we say the same thing? Just while the band gets up
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:52.400]   to play the next song, I invite you just to close your eyes. I just invite you just to
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:18:08.720]   reflect on this. And I ask you a question. Do we know? Do we know the presence and power
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:18.220]   of God in our life? The one who was a baby in a manger in Bethlehem, who went on to die
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:26.640]   on a cross for you and me, who rose from the dead that we might be free of sin, and who
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:42.960]   sends his Holy Spirit to be with us now. Father God, let it be to me according to your
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:19:00.880]   word. Behold, I am your servant. Fill me with your Holy Spirit and help me this Christmas
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:16.360]   to realize you are always present in my life. I bless you in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.560]   and I hope to see you very, very soon. God bless.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:29.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
