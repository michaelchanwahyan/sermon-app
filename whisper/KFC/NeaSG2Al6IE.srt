00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,240
 Today we reach week 4 of our Emotionally Healthy series.

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,180
 This is not just a new series.

3
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,240
 We are implementing a new culture.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:28,500
 You see, our spiritual health, our relationship with Jesus is tied to our emotional health.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,600
 You cannot separate these two things.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,120
 Jesus didn't and neither can we.

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,760
 Three weeks ago James got us started.

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,820
 He set the scene as it were.

9
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,500
 Two weeks ago I asked the question "Why?" as I talked about going beneath the surface

10
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,280
 and asking why we do the things that we do.

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,580
 Last week Michelle talked about breaking the power of the past.

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,240
 I want to honor her for her openness.

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:10,160
 Tonight I'm talking about the Emotionally Healthy trait of living in brokenness and

14
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,040
 vulnerability.

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:21,360
 We all know that if I want to have meaningful relationships I need to be broken.

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,200
 I need to be vulnerable.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,440
 But we don't do it.

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:40,900
 And the main reason is we don't actually know.

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:49,480
 If we turn to Genesis 37 which Bonnie read to us, we come across a man called Jacob.

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,000
 Now you know what Jacob's other name was don't you?

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,100
 Yes, it was Israel.

22
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,440
 And you know how many sons he had?

23
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,680
 Yes, twelve.

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,200
 Who became the twelve tribes of Israel.

25
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,920
 And we come across this character Joseph.

26
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,080
 And Joseph was his daddy's favorite.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,200
 I'm always amazed when people who know I've got two sons ask me "Which one is your favorite

28
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
 son?"

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,400
 Or when they find out I've got five grandchildren, say "Which one is your favorite grandchild?"

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,600
 Make no mistake, favoritism is a sin.

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,400
 And here it is generational.

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,080
 We saw it with Abraham and it was handed down through Isaac.

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,080
 Generational sin.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,320
 And Jacob made it very clear who his favorite was.

35
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,880
 He brought him the coat of many colors.

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,760
 It made the other eleven mad.

37
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,140
 Right really mad.

38
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,240
 So mad they wanted to kill Joseph.

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:09,240
 They were about to kill him when one especially creative brother, he got an idea.

40
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,440
 This brother's name is Judah.

41
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
 Let's read this.

42
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:22,360
 "Then Judah said to his brothers, 'What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his

43
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
 blood?

44
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:32,000
 Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,680
 brother, our own flesh.'

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,460
 And his brothers listened to him."

47
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,240
 Now this is sibling rivalry in its extreme form.

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,720
 Crazy.

49
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,320
 About to kill him.

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,760
 Judah's idea says, "Hey bros, we can make a little bit of money from this situation."

51
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,160
 Now notice he couches it in a nicety quote.

52
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,800
 He's our own brother, our own flesh and blood.

53
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,280
 But Joseph is sold and you know the story.

54
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:19,480
 And as such it becomes a sort of parallel to Judah's story that we're going to see tonight.

55
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,480
 We're going to look at Judah's story in Genesis 38.

56
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:31,680
 Now Genesis 38 surely fits into the category of spiritual oddities.

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,640
 I've rarely, if at all, heard it preached in church.

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:45,320
 Now notice how it is planted right in the middle of Joseph's story.

59
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
 Verse 1.

60
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,800
 "It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and turned aside to

61
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,760
 a certain Adolamite whose name was Hira.

62
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:08,340
 In the midst of his father's grief, in the midst of family turmoil, Judah goes AWOL."

63
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,200
 You might say we do the same.

64
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,920
 Get away from my deadbeat dad, etc.

65
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,900
 But you'd be missing something.

66
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,200
 See where Jacob and his sons lived was a place called Canaan.

67
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,880
 Canaan was of course the promised land.

68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,480
 Abraham was called into it.

69
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:35,360
 So Judah is not only leaving his grieving father and his distraught family, he is leaving

70
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,640
 the promised land.

71
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,480
 The place where one day Messiah would come through.

72
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
 Let's read on.

73
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:49,460
 "There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shuwa.

74
00:05:49,460 --> 00:06:00,120
 He took her and went into her, and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Ur."

75
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:10,600
 So Judah goes from the promised land, he leaves his family, and marries a Canaanite woman.

76
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:17,160
 Judah probably in defiance of his father's wishes is said to marry a Canaanite girl instead

77
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,640
 of someone closer to his own kith and kin.

78
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,720
 Remember God had said don't marry outside the family of Israel or they will turn you

79
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,840
 away to their own gods.

80
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:39,840
 They had three sons, the oldest of whom eventually marries a girl named Tamar.

81
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,120
 This man dies soon after without having a son, an heir, born to him.

82
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,640
 So as was the custom of the day to ensure the succession of the family line, Judah makes

83
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,120
 his second son marry Tamar.

84
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:07,860
 But before long he dies too, having refused to even try to have a baby with Tamar.

85
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,680
 We move on to verse 11.

86
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,280
 "Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, 'Remain a widow in your father's house, till

87
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:28,120
 Shelah my son grows up, for he feared that he would die like his brothers.'

88
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,560
 So Tamar went and remained in her father's house."

89
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,040
 By now Judah is starting to think that Tamar is nothing short of bad luck.

90
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,640
 So even though he promises to give Tamar in marriage to his last and his youngest son,

91
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:54,620
 secretly Judah intends to do no such thing.

92
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,960
 So what if Tamar is remained a bereft and childless widow the rest of her days?

93
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,160
 This girl is a husband killer.

94
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,720
 She is jinxed.

95
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,120
 So he wasn't about to let her wipe out also his final child.

96
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,560
 Now this is so offensive.

97
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,600
 He is disowning her.

98
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:23,440
 The law said it was the father-in-law's responsibility to take his widow daughter-in-law into his

99
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,680
 family and care for her like a daughter.

100
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,400
 And things are about to get worse, much worse.

101
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
 Let's read on.

102
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
 Verse 12.

103
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:44,640
 "In the course of time, the wife of Judah, Shewa's daughter, died.

104
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,680
 When Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah, to his sheep shearers, he and his friend Hira

105
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,020
 the Adalamite."

106
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,280
 So what we have here, his wife dies.

107
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,840
 He is grieving his wife.

108
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,280
 He goes to a sheep shearing party.

109
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:12,040
 I guess the modern day equivalent of this would be a rave, a party, an orgy.

110
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,480
 Judah numbs his pain with drunkenness.

111
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,920
 Let's read on.

112
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,000
 "When Tamar was told, 'Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,'

113
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,540
 she took off her widow's garment and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up,

114
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,800
 and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah.

115
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,880
 For she saw that Shewa had grown up and she had not been given to him in marriage.

116
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,840
 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.

117
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,360
 He turned to her at the roadside and said, 'Come, let me come into you.'

118
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,480
 For he did not know she was his daughter-in-law.

119
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:08,360
 She said to him, 'What will you give me that you might come into me?'"

120
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:18,360
 Tamar's plan was to become pregnant by this ruse so that she might bear a child in Judah's

121
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:25,120
 line, since Judah had not kept his promise to give her to his son Shelah, who was by

122
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,800
 now grown up.

123
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
 Let's read on.

124
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
 Verse 18.

125
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,880
 "He said, 'What pledge shall I give you?'

126
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:40,400
 She replied, 'Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand.'

127
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:47,960
 So he gave them to her and went into her, and she conceived by him.

128
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,280
 Then she arose and went away.

129
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,440
 Taking off her veil, she put on the garments of her widowhood."

130
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:03,840
 Judah gave her the things that make him him.

131
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,480
 I guess in Hong Kong it's like giving your Hong Kong ID card or your driving license,

132
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,080
 the things that made him a patriarch.

133
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,200
 He trades them for sex.

134
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,960
 He thought he was sleeping with a shrine prostitute.

135
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,940
 That was very much the ancient worship practice.

136
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,120
 The temples, the shrines had their own prostitutes.

137
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,560
 Let's read on.

138
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,440
 "When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adalamite to take back the pledge from

139
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,760
 the woman's hand, he did not find her.

140
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:53,080
 And he asked the men of the place, 'Where is the cult prostitute who was at Enahim at

141
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,200
 the roadside?'

142
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,520
 And they said, 'No cult prostitute had been here.'"

143
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,080
 Jacob clearly had no regard for Yahweh, for God.

144
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,320
 And it gets worse.

145
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,120
 You'll see from the verse on your screen, a few months later, when her belly began to

146
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:26,000
 bulge a bit, "A servant noticed this and so informed Judah, 'Tamar is with child.'"

147
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,960
 At last, Judah saw the opening he had maybe been looking for.

148
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:42,200
 In one foul swoop, he could get rid of this bad luck woman, free his youngest son to marry

149
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:47,880
 someone else, and just be done with the whole thing.

150
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:57,040
 The best part is that since Tamar was clearly guilty of adultery and/or fornication, putting

151
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,280
 her to death was fully allowed by the law.

152
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,240
 So he could get rid of this problem and not get into trouble for doing so at the same

153
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,000
 time.

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,520
 The sort of guy Judah is burns women.

155
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:23,560
 The book of Leviticus said the punishment was to stone them.

156
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,200
 This guy was about to go one stage further.

157
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,280
 Judah is a self-righteous hypocrite.

158
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,480
 Judah is a liar.

159
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,160
 Judah is a betrayer.

160
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,000
 Judah is a snake with no regard for God.

161
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,640
 A drunk, a pervert, profane, the sort of person who burns women.

162
00:13:51,640 --> 00:14:01,000
 In that moment, she is unmarried, pregnant, and he is declaring his righteousness.

163
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,240
 He is proud.

164
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,640
 He is pompous.

165
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:16,880
 All of a sudden, the story takes a catastrophic turn.

166
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,360
 Let's read it.

167
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:27,720
 Verse 25, "As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, 'By the man

168
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,120
 to whom these belong, I am pregnant.'

169
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:45,400
 And she said, 'Please identify who these are, the signet, the cord, and the star.'"

170
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,760
 What a bummer.

171
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,880
 The whole town has turned out to try this woman.

172
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,360
 Nobody could have scripted this.

173
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,280
 Judah is utterly exposed.

174
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:11,720
 We'll come back to Judah, but this leads me nicely into tonight's topic of brokenness

175
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,680
 and vulnerability.

176
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,520
 Pete Siqueiros on his broken, emotionally healthy series, his group of books, says this,

177
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:30,080
 "In emotionally healthy churches, people live and lead out of brokenness and vulnerability.

178
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:37,960
 They understand their leadership in the kingdom of God is from the bottom up and not a grasping,

179
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,840
 controlling, or lording it over others.

180
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:49,080
 It is leading out of failure and pain, questions and struggles."

181
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:56,460
 This is what an emotionally healthy church looks like.

182
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:03,800
 But the question for us is, what does brokenness look like?

183
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:10,480
 Well, Judah gives us a very good look at what brokenness looks like.

184
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,320
 I've got this definition.

185
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:21,920
 Brokenness comes from a sin that happens to us, the sin that happens around us, and the

186
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,880
 sin that happens through us.

187
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,480
 Sin that we don't have control over.

188
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,200
 For example, the person who's watching this online and straight away after the service

189
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,600
 is over will get back to watching porn.

190
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,040
 Somebody who has an emotional attachment to maybe a male or female in the office and it's

191
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,640
 very unhealthy.

192
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,840
 There are other things as well.

193
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:58,200
 People who've been abused, people who are angry.

194
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:07,440
 Church is made up more of people who would try to control their brokenness than to reveal

195
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,440
 it.

196
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:16,520
 And my experience is that there are one of three reactions to brokenness in a church.

197
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,400
 We're going to look at them now.

198
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
 The first one is to flee.

199
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,200
 Judah's example of dealing with his wife's death was to go to a sheep shearing party

200
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,520
 and mask it with numbing pain.

201
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:38,320
 When Hong Kong life sucks and things don't go your way, we go to the latest restaurant

202
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:46,500
 if we can, or we hide it with booze, shopping, spending.

203
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,280
 The second one is to fight.

204
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,880
 We live a bitter and angry life.

205
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,380
 We pick an issue.

206
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:03,080
 We believe our anger is righteous indignation.

207
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,120
 And the third one is we hide.

208
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:12,480
 We think we can cover up, put our best out and hide up the unsightly parts of our life.

209
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,800
 All our social media is based on this.

210
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,560
 There are bits of my life that I want you to see.

211
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,040
 This is what Judah does.

212
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:37,000
 But the thing about Judah, he flees, he fights, he hides.

213
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,440
 Is that things end up going rather well for him.

214
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,200
 After the story, things go well for Judah.

215
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,760
 This is probably going to make you mad.

216
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,680
 But Judah, the muttonhead, gets blessed.

217
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:09,560
 At the end of his father's life, at the end of Jacob's life, he calls his sons together

218
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,480
 and he speaks words over them.

219
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,520
 Words about their life and legacy and what their life is going to look like.

220
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,880
 A blessing.

221
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:26,800
 And we see amazingly that nobody gets a blessing like Judah.

222
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,440
 A glowing blessing about his legacy and future.

223
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,160
 Here's what he says in Genesis 49.

224
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,440
 You won't believe this.

225
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,800
 Judah, your brothers shall praise you.

226
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,080
 Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies.

227
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,000
 Your father's son shall bow down before you.

228
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 Judah is a lion's cub from the prey, my son, you have gone up.

229
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,940
 He stooped down.

230
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:58,320
 He crouched as a lion and as a lioness who dares rouse him.

231
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,000
 The scepter shall not depart from Judah nor the ruler's staff from beneath his feet until

232
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,760
 tribute comes to him.

233
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,360
 And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.

234
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,480
 Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey's colt to the choice vine, he has washed his

235
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,280
 garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes.

236
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:32,840
 His eyes are darker than wine and his teeth whiter than milk.

237
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:40,640
 This is the blessing that Judah receives.

238
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,640
 Is it fair?

239
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,800
 I mean, take Joseph.

240
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,800
 There is no record whatsoever of Joseph sinning his life.

241
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,320
 He saves his people.

242
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,160
 When confronted with Polypha's wife who wants to sleep with him, he flees because he trusts

243
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,840
 God.

244
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:10,600
 And yet Judah, who has sex with his daughter-in-law, believing she is a prostitute, gets that kind

245
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,560
 of blessing.

246
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:22,520
 Is it fair to bless a snake like Judah rather than, say, a righteous person like Joseph?

247
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,400
 Look again at verse 10.

248
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
 I want to see its significance.

249
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,820
 You probably missed it the first time.

250
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:36,600
 The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from beneath his feet, until

251
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:43,640
 tribute comes to him, and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.

252
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,960
 My friends, this verse refers to Messiah.

253
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,120
 It is a messianic prophecy.

254
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:06,300
 Through your line, Judah, this is where the Messiah is going to come through.

255
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,980
 In Matthew 1 we see a genealogy.

256
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:17,300
 It connects the dots between Abraham and Jesus.

257
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,980
 And look at these verses.

258
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:28,380
 Where is his lineage?

259
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,380
 Judah.

260
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,380
 Yuck.

261
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,380
 Gross.

262
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,060
 Hold on.

263
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:46,220
 Let's go back to the time that Judah is exposed.

264
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,500
 Tamar is pregnant and unmarried.

265
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:59,580
 Judah is the prime accuser until he is found out.

266
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,460
 But he doesn't flee.

267
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,160
 He doesn't fight.

268
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,540
 He doesn't hide.

269
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,860
 He gets real.

270
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,860
 Let's read.

271
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:22,900
 And she, that is Tamar, said, "Please identify whose these are, the signet, the cord, and

272
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,060
 the staff."

273
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:34,500
 Then Judah identified them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I did not

274
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,580
 give her to my son, Shelah."

275
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:51,580
 He exposes his wickedness and says, "I'm the one who deserves the punishment."

276
00:23:51,580 --> 00:24:00,780
 And he proceeds to get himself right before God to such an extent that we see after Genesis

277
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:07,500
 38, the 12 sons often referred to as Judah and his brothers.

278
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,660
 Let me give you an example.

279
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,020
 Genesis 44, 14.

280
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,140
 When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there.

281
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,620
 They fell before him to the ground.

282
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:29,580
 Now the author of Genesis is trying to tell us that Judah has changed.

283
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,260
 Why?

284
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,860
 How?

285
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:41,700
 He got honest with who he was and he changed as a result.

286
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:49,340
 In Genesis 44, he promises to his father to take the blame if anything happens to his

287
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,780
 youngest son, Benjamin.

288
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,140
 He even pledges his life.

289
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,460
 You know the story, don't you?

290
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,500
 Joseph rises to a position of power in Egypt.

291
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:09,300
 Twenty years after being betrayed, he meets his brothers again without recognizing them.

292
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:16,140
 The youngest brother, Benjamin, had remained in Canaan with Jacob.

293
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:26,300
 So Joseph takes Simeon hostage and insists that the brothers return with Benjamin.

294
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:35,340
 Jacob instead offers himself to Jacob as security for Benjamin's safety and manages to persuade

295
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,820
 Jacob to let him take Benjamin to Egypt.

296
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:49,860
 When the brothers return, Joseph tests them by demanding the enslavement of Benjamin.

297
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:56,980
 We see Judah pleading for Benjamin's life.

298
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:04,420
 And this is where we see Joseph revealing his true identity.

299
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:15,820
 Judah had made a 180 degrees turnaround from selling his brother Joseph into slavery.

300
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,020
 That's how much he had changed.

301
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:26,740
 And he says, "Let the hurt be on me."

302
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,740
 But why?

303
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,820
 Why did Judah get the blessing?

304
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,700
 Because Judah is acting like Christ.

305
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,500
 The blame due to someone else, he took on himself.

306
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,300
 Let the hurt be on me.

307
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,980
 Who does that remind you of?

308
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,020
 Yes, Christ.

309
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,900
 Jesus substituting for us, taking the punishment that was due to us.

310
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:03,020
 And Judah becomes an example for us.

311
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,500
 So what do we learn from Judah?

312
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,180
 Two things.

313
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:14,780
 Firstly, brokenness kept inside destroys us.

314
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:21,100
 When you keep your sin a secret, it suffocates you.

315
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,620
 Judah believed he was worthless and he lived his life on that premise.

316
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:31,140
 He got angry because he believed his father didn't love him.

317
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,060
 Behind anger, we often find hurt.

318
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:46,140
 What holds us in brokenness so often is our shame and it dictates our way of life.

319
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,900
 I'm worthless.

320
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,020
 I crave affirmation.

321
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
 I'm dumb.

322
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,220
 I'm not intelligent.

323
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,540
 So I hold my opinion back.

324
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,540
 I'm bad.

325
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,620
 I'm trouble.

326
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,140
 So we keep our brokenness.

327
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,580
 We keep our sins from our friends and from God.

328
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:11,020
 David in Psalm 32 said, "When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away through

329
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:15,900
 my groaning all day long."

330
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:22,820
 When you get vulnerable, you get to be you.

331
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,260
 When you get honest, you get to be you.

332
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:35,020
 Your dreams are on the table and there you'll be known for who you really are.

333
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:44,820
 Our job here at KFCI is to create a safe space for others to be real.

334
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:50,660
 A place for the Judah's.

335
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:59,060
 Now if brokenness kept inside destroys us, the second point is this.

336
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,860
 Grace empowers us.

337
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,980
 The gospel is not legalism.

338
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,680
 It doesn't say you shape up or else.

339
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,520
 The gospel is humble yourself.

340
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,740
 The gospel is be honest.

341
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:24,580
 Yes, the Bible does say the wages of sin are death, but in the same breath, it tells us

342
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:33,500
 that you are loved so much by God that his son would pay those wages.

343
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,220
 You see what that does for you.

344
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,700
 It gives you a proper perspective of your self-worth.

345
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:47,180
 I found this wonderful quote from the book by Francis Spufford called Unapologetic.

346
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,740
 I want to read it to you.

347
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,700
 If you won't hear the bad news about yourself, you can't know yourself.

348
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:00,540
 You condemn yourself to the maintenance of an exhausting illusion, a false front about

349
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:08,060
 yourself which keeps out doubt and with it hope, change, nourishment, breath, life.

350
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:17,860
 If you won't hear the bad news, you can't begin to hear the good news about yourself.

351
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:30,500
 Jesus is actually looking for people like Judah because they need him.

352
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:41,980
 Have you been honest to realize today that you still need him?

353
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,220
 Be honest with God.

354
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,700
 Tell him everything.

355
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,740
 That's where grace steps in.

356
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,460
 I think many of you know the story of Amazing Grace and John Newton.

357
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,740
 John Newton was a slave trader.

358
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:10,180
 In 1748 during his return voyage to England aboard the ship Greyhound, Newton had a spiritual

359
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,140
 conversion.

360
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:20,260
 From that point on, he avoided profanity, gambling and drinking.

361
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:31,420
 Although he continued to work in the slave trade for some time, eventually he gave up

362
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:36,980
 being a slave trader and he became a priest in the Anglican Church.

363
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:45,380
 He wrote around 250 hymns including Amazing Grace.

364
00:31:45,380 --> 00:32:00,500
 He said "I once was blind but the process took some time as it does for you and I."

365
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:10,260
 And here's the thing, when you get honest about your brokenness and you say "I want

366
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,540
 to give up binge drinking, gambling, porn, whatever."

367
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:24,020
 If you give God an inch, he will take a mile.

368
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:33,780
 Give him just a bit of your brokenness and you will find out just how amazing grace is.

369
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:39,560
 What God did for Judah, he'll do for you and me.

370
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:46,020
 You can hardly call Judah or Tamar biblical role models.

371
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,980
 No one would look to either figure in order to determine the best way to combat one's

372
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,980
 life.

373
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:59,940
 But precisely in their weakness, in their proneness to sin, in the mistakes that each

374
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:08,320
 makes and in the sin into which both fall, somehow in and through all of that, we can

375
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,480
 maybe identify with these two just a little bit.

376
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,340
 And although we don't want to imitate them, I'm not saying that, we may recognize that

377
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,300
 even so, sometimes we are like them anyway.

378
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,640
 We too make mistakes.

379
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:32,220
 We too sometimes find ourselves doing or saying things that place us on the opposite side

380
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,380
 of God's desires.

381
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:43,940
 And sometimes we too may discover that God accomplished something good in our lives despite

382
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:53,640
 how undeserving we are, despite how badly we messed things up.

383
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:00,980
 In any event, we know how much we need grace.

384
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:14,500
 My friends, this is a funny little story, but if it can marvel us to see grace, to marvel

385
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:28,020
 afresh at the wonder of grace, then it yielded some very good things after all.

386
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,620
 I want to encourage you.

387
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:42,400
 I'm going to pray for you now to show grace to yourselves and to use that measure to show

388
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,380
 grace to others.

389
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:54,740
 As the band comes up, may we pray.

390
00:34:54,740 --> 00:35:02,940
 Father God, yeah, we don't want to live a life that is like Judah or Tamar.

391
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,340
 We don't see them as role models.

392
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:12,440
 But Lord, what we do see through their lives is your amazing grace.

393
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:19,260
 I pray that today, Lord, we will open our hands and receive that amazing grace.

394
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,500
 We will be prepared to be broken, to be vulnerable.

395
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:30,420
 And Lord, I pray that you would help us to show grace to ourselves and to show that same

396
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,860
 grace to others.

397
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,980
 In Jesus' name, amen.

398
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
 Amen.

399
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:36,980
 Amen.

400
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,980
 Amen.
