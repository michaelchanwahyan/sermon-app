[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.520]   - Good evening.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.860]   How is everybody doing?
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.700]   Can you believe it?
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.900]   2022 is almost over.
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.160]   We can take a deep breath.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.440]   Wow.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.020]   What a year it has been.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.020]   What is one word you would use to describe 2022?
[00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.120]   What is one word you would use?
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.960]   What is one word?
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.100]   Okay, somebody said COVID.
[00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.400]   Okay, everybody shout out the word in one, two, three.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.240]   Okay?
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.880]   One, two, three, shout out your word.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.480]   - COVID.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.880]   - Okay, I heard some great.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.600]   I had some COVID, so I didn't hear anything else.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.680]   But I would say that this year
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.240]   has been a year of uncertainty.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.280]   Uncertainty.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.520]   Yes, COVID has been mutating,
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.680]   and we had alpha, beta, delta,
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.280]   and Omnicron was at the height.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.500]   When I was back in Canada in January,
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.120]   and you remember these lockdowns,
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.900]   they would just randomly lock down your block,
[00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.420]   you remember, and you would be trapped there.
[00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.940]   It was, you had no idea, right?
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.940]   You would just be randomly trapped in that quarantine zone.
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.180]   And not only was COVID still going on,
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.180]   a war started.
[00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.780]   Ukraine was attacked by Russia,
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.580]   and this left lots of people, refugees,
[00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.580]   running out of Ukraine to other countries.
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.580]   And with this war came the threat of nuclear, nuclear war,
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.820]   and a lot of sanctions were happening against Russia,
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.300]   and so because of that, energy prices went up,
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.940]   and the markets went crazy,
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.240]   and we don't know, it's going up and down,
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.340]   up and down, up and down.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.340]   And on top of that, 2022, the queen died,
[00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.060]   and that was a very, just shocking thing,
[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.660]   that the queen had reigned for so many years, and she died.
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.500]   But it wasn't all negative, it wasn't all negative.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.960]   It was a tough year, but it wasn't all negative.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.980]   Travel started to ease up.
[00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.520]   Who's ready to travel again?
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.780]   Yeah, good, I see a couple people admitting it.
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.900]   And not only was traveling starting to go around,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.900]   we had the best football World Cup match ever, finals ever.
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.740]   A lot of people love Messi, and I'm not a Messi fan,
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.260]   but I'm happy for Messi fans, he finally won it.
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.260]   And our world has gotten bigger in terms of population.
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.180]   We are now at eight billion people.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.620]   Wow, eight billion people.
[00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.620]   And so 2022, I would say was a year of uncertainty.
[00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.200]   There's social and political uncertainty,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.480]   still protests around the world,
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.120]   and in Peru and different countries.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.500]   There's economical and financial uncertainty,
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.820]   the fear of recession and housing markets going down,
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.080]   and we don't know what's gonna happen with the markets.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.580]   The global health uncertainty,
[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.060]   we don't know how the pandemic is gonna end,
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.200]   or when it's gonna end, or if it's gonna continue on.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.320]   And then there's environmental uncertainty,
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.660]   the threat of global warming and climate change.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.940]   There's so much uncertainty in our world.
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.420]   And not only is there uncertainty in our world,
[00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.700]   there was also uncertainty in Jesus' time.
[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.360]   There was the Romans controlling everything, right?
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.020]   And then there was also the Jewish extremists
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.560]   called the Zealots, and they were trying to do something
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.020]   to uprise against the Romans.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.360]   There was uncertainty.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.300]   Was Rome continue, would Rome continue to take over Israel?
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.900]   Or would Israel finally be free?
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.780]   And the disciples were like,
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.500]   you're supposed to be the Messiah,
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.380]   but you're leaving us?
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.300]   You're leaving us?
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.140]   Where are you going?
[00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.960]   In the place you're going, we cannot come?
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.260]   But you're supposed to be the Messiah.
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.020]   You're supposed to save us.
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:18.020]   And Jesus says this in John 14, verse 27, he says this,
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.980]   peace I leave with you, peace I give to you,
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.980]   not as the world gives, not as the world do I give to you,
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.440]   not as the world gives do I give to you.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.500]   Let not your hearts be troubled,
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.020]   neither let them be afraid.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.040]   Jesus promises peace.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.040]   Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.520]   How would you define peace?
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.000]   How would you define peace?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.700]   All right, go around with someone beside you
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.840]   and share what your definition of peace is.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.140]   You have 20 seconds.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.780]   It's interactive, yeah, talk with people around you.
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.840]   Go, what is your definition of peace?
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.720]   - Sleep well.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.880]   - Sleep well, yeah, I would like it.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.500]   Okay, what is your definition of peace?
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.380]   Joseph said sleep well, shout it out.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:25.740]   Calm, okay, calm.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.160]   Jesus, okay, very good, very biblical answer.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.020]   Nowadays, we define peace
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.940]   is like sitting on this beach, right?
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.500]   Just peace, just nothing going on,
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.500]   the waves crashing in and out,
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.880]   our hands and our feet on the sand.
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.540]   We define peace as an absence of conflict.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.220]   No conflict means peace, no war means peace.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.100]   Avoidance of trouble, of struggles, of poverty,
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.440]   we define peace as avoidance, absence.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.800]   And we define peace as being relaxed,
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.480]   resting, comfortable, good night's sleep.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:18.240]   And Jesus, in Jewish culture, they would say shalom, right?
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.440]   You guys have been to Israel, they would say shalom,
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.040]   shalom, peace be with you.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.600]   And that was a way that they would greet each other
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   and then they would say bye to each other.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.920]   And I think it was maybe 10 years ago,
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.600]   people, teenagers would say peace,
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.480]   when they say goodbye, right?
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.640]   Peace, bye, peace, something like that.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.280]   But Jesus isn't saying peace, bye, see you later.
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.840]   Jesus is saying something more.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.560]   Firstly, he says peace I leave with you.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.040]   It's as if he's saying that I am peace,
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.840]   I provide you peace.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.040]   He says my peace I give you.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.680]   It's a personal peace.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.400]   It's not just any peace.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   He also says this, I do not give to you as the world gives.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.000]   It is prized, it is set apart.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.300]   His peace is different from the world.
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:26.400]   Peace is not just bye, peace is something different.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.040]   And I believe this, peace does not come from your situation.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.420]   Peace comes from your foundation.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.520]   Let me repeat that.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.080]   Peace does not come from your situation,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.080]   but it comes from your foundation.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.920]   The cause of peace,
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.740]   we're gonna learn a couple things today.
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:53.960]   The four things we're gonna learn.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.360]   The cause of peace, the call to make peace,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.440]   the challenge of seeking peace in tough times,
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.440]   and the consequence of peace.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.680]   The cause, the call, the challenge, and the consequence.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.320]   The first thing is the cause for peace.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.960]   Who is the cause for peace?
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.240]   Jesus says my peace I give to you.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.160]   God's name, one of God's name.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.400]   When Gideon was raising an altar,
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   he called Yahweh, Lord, as the Lord of peace.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.280]   That's one of his names.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.520]   Jesus, his name is the Prince of Peace.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.480]   For to us a child is born.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.200]   He shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.680]   God is the source of peace.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.700]   His name is peace.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.040]   Jesus is the Prince of Peace.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.200]   And Paul also says this,
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   that the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.380]   Love, joy, peace.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.760]   Peace is one of the fruits of the Spirit.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.640]   It comes from depending on the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.960]   It's not from ourselves.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.400]   It is given by the Lord.
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   It's given by the Lord.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.920]   I was in the Philippines and we were doing a mission trip.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.040]   Who's been to the Philippines?
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.600]   Raise your hand.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.760]   Ni hao, raise your hand.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.600]   Yes, good.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.120]   I was in the Philippines.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.680]   We were with a missions team together.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.680]   And on our way back from Cebu or another city,
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.680]   we had to pass through Manila, okay?
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.280]   And to pass through Manila,
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.520]   we had to show our passports once again
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.400]   to go back to Hong Kong.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.240]   And we were on the trip.
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.960]   I think there was like 10 of us or something like that.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.400]   And once we were in Manila, everything was good.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.640]   And we were about to pass customs
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.400]   to go to Hong Kong to our next flight.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.440]   And once we were at customs,
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.320]   one of the guys was like, "Oh no."
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   And I looked at him, I was like, "What happened?"
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.480]   And he's like, "He left his passport on the plane."
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.280]   Has anybody done that before?
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.560]   You know, the front pocket?
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:25.720]   Yeah, has anybody put their passport in the front pocket
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.760]   and forgot it?
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.840]   That's what he did.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.640]   And at that time, I was thinking, "Oh no.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.240]   "I guess we're staying in Manila for a couple more days.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.600]   "I guess we'll go to the consulate and get it.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.400]   "If anything, we can stay a couple days
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.940]   "and the rest of the team can go first
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.920]   "and I'll stay with this guy.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.240]   "We'll get a hotel and stay in Manila
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.680]   "and wait for his passport."
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:55.680]   Even though things were frustrating,
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.120]   I had a sense of peace.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.720]   Peace knowing that God was in control.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.320]   And we waited in this,
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.760]   we went to this office where it was like lost and found
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.640]   or something like that.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.000]   And we asked them, "Can you get this passport?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   "This is the seat number."
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.640]   He left it in front here.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.880]   And we were praying.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.400]   We didn't know whether our flight was boarding.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.880]   So there was a time race.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.920]   We didn't know if we could board this flight.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.040]   We didn't know what was gonna happen,
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.800]   but there was a sense of peace
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.780]   knowing that God was in control.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.440]   And the passport arrived in time, thankfully.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.400]   And we rushed off running for our flight
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.200]   and we made it back to Hong Kong.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.680]   The cause of peace is God.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.120]   True peace comes from knowing God is in control.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.280]   And what happens is we need to place our faith in Him.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.440]   The cause of peace is God.
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.180]   And what He does is He calls us to make peace.
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.640]   Jesus says this, "Blessed are the peacemakers
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.760]   "for they will be called the children of God."
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.120]   Blessed are the peacemakers.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.520]   Jesus calls us to be peacemakers.
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.100]   Also, Paul writes this in 2 Corinthians,
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.820]   "Finally, brothers, rejoice, aim for restoration,
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.120]   "comfort one another, agree with one another,
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.720]   "live in peace, and the God of love and peace
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.140]   "will be with you."
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:38.140]   Jesus calls us to not only have peace, but to make peace.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.160]   And that's not always easy to make peace,
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.160]   especially when there's conflict, when people have hurt you.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.140]   But Jesus is the ultimate example of making peace.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.120]   Read this with me, Ephesians chapter two.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.360]   Read this with me, one, two, three.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.220]   "For He, Christ, Himself, is our peace,
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.400]   "who has made us both Jews and Gentiles one,
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.920]   "and has broken down in His flesh
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.400]   "the dividing wall of hostility
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.160]   "by abolishing the law of commandments
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.280]   "expressed in ordinances that He might create in Himself
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.280]   "one new man in the place of two, so making peace."
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:28.520]   Jesus is the ultimate example of making peace.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.560]   And how did He make peace?
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.240]   He made peace by dying on the cross for us.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   There was conflict between us and God because of our sin.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:48.240]   And so Jesus had to die to make peace
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.060]   between this relationship.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:53.160]   And so the first thing that Jesus calls us
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.800]   to make peace with is peace with God,
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.320]   as you see in the next slide, peace with God.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.520]   It was purchased by God, it is personal,
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.620]   it was purchased on the cross, and it reconciles us to God.
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.440]   And in order for us to make peace with God,
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.760]   what is required is for us to confess,
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.640]   agree that God has died for us,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.680]   and that we are sinners, confession.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.600]   The second thing that God calls us to make peace
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.100]   is with others.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:33.860]   Because Jesus died on the cross and made peace
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.580]   between God and us.
[00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:39.560]   He set an example for us.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.340]   Because God first loved us, we also should love others.
[00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:50.220]   He brought peace between the hostilities,
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.340]   between Jews and Gentiles.
[00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.140]   Before Jews had the law, they were the promised people.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.700]   Gentiles were outsiders,
[00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.580]   but Jesus brought these people together.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.940]   Now they are one body in Christ through faith.
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:09.560]   We are reconciled to each other through Christ.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:14.160]   We are a community, one body of Christ.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:20.220]   I was in Taiwan, we were in Taiwan for a mission trip.
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.780]   There's a lot of peace needed in mission trips,
[00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.940]   just so you know.
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:27.300]   And in this mission trip,
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:33.940]   there was a group of us that were very normal,
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.980]   just normal, cool people.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.140]   And then there was another group that was very high energy.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.500]   We'd go out there, yeah, let's go share the gospel,
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.380]   yeah, let's go meet people.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:49.180]   And then there was another group that was very slow
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.780]   and sick and tired.
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:16:00.300]   And so we had three groups of people on this mission trip.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:06.000]   And there was a lot of peace that was needed to be made.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.380]   The tired group would be like,
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.820]   oh, can we sleep a little longer?
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.740]   Can we be a little late?
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.380]   The high energy people were like, yo, let's go, let's go.
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.460]   Okay, that was me, I'm sorry.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.300]   That was me.
[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.620]   Let's go, let's do something.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.380]   We're here, let's go meet people, let's share the gospel.
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:26.620]   And the tired people would be like,
[00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.340]   ah, I'm a little bit tired, feeling a little sick.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.380]   And there needs to be peace.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.000]   We need to make peace.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.540]   Jesus calls us to peace with God.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.780]   Jesus calls us with peace with each other.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.740]   And Jesus calls us to peace with ourselves.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.900]   Jesus says this, or Paul says this,
[00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.180]   therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:01.020]   The old has passed away, behold, the new has come.
[00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:05.700]   Our God is a God that loves us.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.820]   And God disciplines the ones he loves.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.900]   And in this process of being disciplined,
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:21.500]   it takes time and it takes us accepting our weaknesses
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:27.780]   and it takes peace, peace accepting ourselves
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.500]   and this process.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:36.220]   Paul also says this, now may the God of peace himself
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.260]   sanctify you completely and may your whole spirit
[00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:43.060]   and soul and body be kept blameless
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.620]   at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:53.100]   The peace of God will sanctify us, discipline us.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.240]   And we especially need this peace
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.420]   in tough, challenging times.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:07.200]   Jesus says this, I have said these things to you
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.760]   that in me, you may have peace.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.080]   In the world, you will have tribulation,
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.480]   but take heart, I have overcome the world.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.500]   Jesus says we will have trials, we will have tough times,
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.380]   we'll have tough financial times,
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.500]   we'll have times we're going through physical health
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:30.100]   difficulties, friendship difficulties,
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.220]   we will have challenging times with each other,
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:38.220]   with ourselves, but God says that he will be our peace.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.720]   In him, we may have peace.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.960]   Paul also tells us, do not be anxious about anything,
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.360]   but in everything by prayer and supplication
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.800]   with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.280]   and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.480]   will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.240]   In the midst of this tough times, difficult times,
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.860]   Jesus says that we should not be anxious,
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:20.100]   but in prayer, we should rely on him,
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:25.220]   that his peace would be with us.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:32.780]   I was at a summer camp recently,
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:36.220]   I was at a summer camp recently,
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.700]   in the summer, not that recent, I guess,
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:46.120]   and I was kayaking, and I was kayaking with a bunch of kids,
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:51.360]   and these kids were like, oh, let's get Johnny,
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:56.120]   let's flip his kayak, and so when he flipped my kayak,
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:01.340]   I actually had my phone in a waterproof case,
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:07.180]   but not a floating case, it was a case that sank,
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.500]   and so when my kayak flipped,
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.140]   and my phone was around my neck,
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.980]   it also sank to the bottom,
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.540]   and so many things were happening,
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.860]   when you get flipped, the water, you're trying to grab air,
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.060]   some things are floating, some things are sinking,
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.120]   you don't know what's gonna happen,
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.220]   your eyes may be burning 'cause of the salt,
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.700]   and then I realized, oh, my phone is not floating,
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:37.540]   it has sunk, and it was the muddiest waters ever,
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.460]   it was zero visibility,
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:44.900]   and so I lost my phone at this camp,
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:47.880]   and you could be very frustrated,
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.140]   you could blame these kids, you could blame yourself,
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:56.140]   you can blame God, God, why you send me here to help out,
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.500]   and I lose my phone,
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.060]   and it's not a nice feeling losing your phone,
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.860]   all your contacts are there,
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.300]   you feel disconnected from the world,
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:11.260]   but at that time, in the midst of these circumstances,
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.140]   I still had a sense of peace,
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.880]   my attitude was, well, God didn't want me
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.660]   to have a phone this weekend,
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.180]   God wanted me to focus on serving the Lord,
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.420]   and loving the people there,
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.180]   and that was my attitude, honestly, that was my attitude,
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:35.420]   and all these worries about all these appointments,
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.580]   or these people coming to message me,
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.180]   I was just like, I'll just leave it up to you, Lord,
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:46.180]   somehow, it will work out, there was a sense of peace,
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.700]   when we put our problems in His hands,
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.800]   He puts His peace in our hearts,
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.340]   peace with God, peace with others,
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:02.040]   peace with ourselves, peace in challenging times,
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.120]   and the consequence of peace is this,
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.260]   the consequence of peace is this,
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.980]   deceit in the heart of those who devise evil,
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.320]   but those who plan peace have joy,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:23.000]   the promise of peace comes with joy,
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.780]   when we experience the peace of God,
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.460]   there is also a sense of joy,
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.020]   knowing that He is in control, that He is with us,
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.940]   and lastly, blessed are the peacemakers,
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.900]   for they shall be called the sons of God,
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:51.780]   when we are making peace with God, with others,
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:56.780]   with ourselves, we are doing what God has called us to do
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:01.700]   as His children, we are called to be like our Father,
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.700]   like Jesus, Jesus is the Prince of Peace,
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.060]   and we're called to be peacemakers,
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:14.860]   and when we do that, we are blessed by the Lord,
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:19.860]   the consequence of peace is joy and happiness,
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.860]   joy and it's being blessed by our Heavenly Father,
[00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.100]   and the blessings might not come on this earth,
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:33.100]   our blessings might come in the life that comes after,
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:41.380]   the consequence of peace is joy and blessing from our Lord,
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.740]   and so I said earlier,
[00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:49.140]   that peace comes not from your situation,
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.780]   the true peace comes from your foundation,
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.780]   and so when our peace with God upward,
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:00.780]   when our peace with God upward is fully secure,
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:07.260]   then we can truly have peace with others outward,
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.860]   and we have truly have peace with ourselves,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.420]   when our foundation is strong,
[00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.860]   our foundation, our relationship with God
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.900]   is peaceful and full of joy,
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.780]   then we can truly have peace with others and ourselves,
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.420]   and in tough situations.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:34.140]   So how do we have peace in times of uncertainty?
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.620]   How do we have peace?
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:39.020]   Peace does not come from your situation,
[00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.780]   but from your foundation,
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:46.860]   and lastly this, peace equals love,
[00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:52.060]   faith plus love plus wisdom plus perseverance,
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:57.180]   peace equals faith in God that He is in control,
[00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.380]   that He loves us,
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:02.180]   and He gives me wisdom to face this situation,
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.220]   this challenging situation,
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.020]   and in this challenging situation,
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.340]   I will need perseverance,
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.580]   because life is challenging,
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.180]   life is challenging,
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.020]   in my relationships with others,
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.780]   to have peace, I need to have faith
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.780]   that God first loved,
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:23.860]   first is the God of peace,
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.500]   and He's called me to love others,
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.900]   and He gives me wisdom to know how to connect with others,
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.700]   and to make peace with others,
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.620]   and connecting with others,
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.180]   and making peace with others is not easy,
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.180]   it requires hard work,
[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.860]   it requires perseverance,
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:48.060]   and so today, what is your foundation?
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.700]   What is your foundation?
[00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:52.420]   As the band comes up,
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.340]   I just want us to close our eyes,
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.180]   what is our foundation of peace?
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.780]   What are we relying on?
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:07.380]   Are we relying on ourselves
[00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.460]   as the foundation of peace?
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:14.460]   If we're relying on ourselves for the foundation of peace,
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.340]   then if things go wrong,
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.540]   then our lives will just go up and down,
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.900]   if we're relying on our bank account for peace,
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.140]   if those numbers go up,
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.100]   or if those numbers go down,
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:30.380]   that's what we're gonna rely on,
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.500]   and it's gonna cause us to go up and down,
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:38.580]   what is our foundation of peace?
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.180]   Is God our foundation of peace?
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:44.220]   Jesus says this,
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.220]   "A wise man builds his house upon a rock."
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.420]   A house upon a rock,
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.580]   'cause when the waves come crashing,
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.180]   it will stand firm.
[00:26:57.180 --> 00:27:03.180]   My prayer to you guys is that Jesus is your foundation,
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.620]   your strong foundation,
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.220]   you're rooted in him,
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.700]   you place your faith fully on him,
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.260]   you depend on him for wisdom,
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.060]   you know that you are loved,
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.340]   and that you persevere with his spirit.
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:25.140]   Let us pray,
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.860]   Heavenly Father,
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.580]   we thank you that you promised peace to us,
[00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.660]   that you are our peace.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:35.980]   In this world of uncertainty,
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.540]   as we close off 2022,
[00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:42.340]   we don't know what the next year will bring,
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:47.540]   but we know that if our foundation,
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:52.660]   the foundation of our peace is you,
[00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.060]   we can go through any storm,
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:56.940]   any trial,
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.820]   anything that comes our way,
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.860]   'cause you are our peace.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.940]   Bless us, Lord,
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:09.420]   help us to be peacemakers,
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.180]   help us to depend on you.
[00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.460]   In Christ's name we pray,
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.300]   amen.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.540]   Let us stand up and respond.
