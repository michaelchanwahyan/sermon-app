[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   I
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.160]   Good evening everybody and the first thing I want to say is a big. Thank you
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.680]   These last few weeks have not been easy for Sandra and I we actually have four
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.520]   Relatives who are shall I say on the final lap of their life?
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.480]   We don't know how long that laps going to be my two sisters my brother-in-law and in particular Sandra's father
[00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.360]   We almost didn't come back and it was a nip and tuck decision
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.220]   But I'm so pleased to be here with you. It's good to be back. I've really missed you
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:43.840]   I've missed preaching and you know, it's I want to encourage you though. I have two weeks. I I preached in Wales and
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.420]   I preached
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.260]   sermons from our church together series the Spirit-filled Church and the Kingdom Church and
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.720]   They liked it so much. They made it into a
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.380]   Small group material so they've got their own their own clan material out out of our sermon
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.800]   so what I'm gonna say just like the Alpha little acorns right growing into big trees and
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.600]   This alpha this time. It's been very small, but actually it's an acorn and
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.240]   It's great when churches around the world are doing
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.240]   Small group serious based on on our material here. So well done everybody
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.920]   But I'm back to the eight five two. I've loved the one Corinthian series and
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.400]   I want to thank Michelle twice Johnny not forgetting pastor Steve. That was amazing and
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.680]   I can't forget you Julie that that week on missions was incredible and
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:42.180]   We've been watching each week live and it's been amazing to see what God has been doing through this series
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.600]   And this is my first chance to speak on one Corinthians
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.840]   I'm grateful to bring this sermon
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.760]   It's it's track five in the one Corinthians series and it's on order in the church
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.940]   Now you might think this is a subject that is not a natural fit for me
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.880]   order in the church
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.060]   Let's be honest
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.220]   I'm often seen in church circles as a bit of a maverick
[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.840]   Always seemingly pushing conventional boundaries
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.640]   I've put some pictures up just from here from KFC. I but I mean how many churches in the world? Do you know?
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.360]   When you talk about the kingdom of God, we did it with Lego sets. Do you remember that? We did the Lego building, you know
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.080]   how many churches in the world have
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.360]   Something like g5 series, you know where where our speakers are in their 20s and their 30s. Sorry Anthony
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.440]   But
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.000]   It was amazing, you know to see Bonnie and Gabe and Paul and Anthony speak to us in the g5
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.800]   How many churches when they do the armor of God?
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.880]   Demonstrate it in this way. Do you remember that? We're Chloe
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.320]   How many churches have a gender reveal in the service look?
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.320]   And
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.640]   I've even been known to preach
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.120]   With plastic fruit when we did the don't allow the enemy a seat at your table. I
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:26.120]   Guess you can say that I've sometimes well, maybe more than sometimes push the envelope
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.280]   Perhaps I should give you some background to that. See I I grew up
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.960]   I went to strict Anglican schools from from primary school to secondary school. I had to go assembly every day of the week
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.960]   I calculated that's over two thousand assemblies
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.560]   The only exception was the special days when we went to church like Saints days
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.800]   And I've got to be honest. It was kind of boring
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.280]   No, no, no, no. No. No, it was very boring and
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.760]   I
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.240]   Remember back. I think it was in I was 10 as 19. Yeah, they're right
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.600]   They're about I was 10 years of age and I just had a birthday and someone had just given me a football diary a soccer
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.320]   Diary for for those Americans and you know
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.840]   And I decided it would be far more interesting for me in church to read my football diary
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.360]   Than to to listen to the church service
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.080]   my headmaster didn't agree and
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.840]   Took me back to school gave me two strokes of the cane and for many years
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.440]   I thought of thought is God like that is God like a headmaster waiting to to give you the cane when you do
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.240]   Something wrong and as a result of this and other experiences
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.720]   I've become a strong opponent of
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.680]   legalism in the church and
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.440]   Have seen and spoken of the danger. You will have heard me of
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.720]   exalting the law of Moses above the grace of Jesus
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.040]   but actually I
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.120]   am a champion of
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.680]   church order or
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.080]   Should I say?
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.440]   biblical
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.440]   church order and
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.640]   Current one Corinthians is an ideal place to start to see what scripture has to say
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.680]   about this important subject I
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.680]   Mean to be honest. I'm not a fan of
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.600]   The free-for-all that I see in many so-called modern churches
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.480]   They often use the expression
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.720]   You've heard it as the spirit leads
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.360]   but actually
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.160]   why a
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.680]   hundred-percent support this sentiment I
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.600]   believe it is used as an excuse as much as a theological statement and
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.800]   The Apostle Paul would seem to agree with me
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.560]   the church in Corinth
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.400]   had become a decidedly as the spirit leads fellowship and
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:11.000]   It ended up quite frankly as a mess and I have witnessed this in
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.960]   churches even in modern times I
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.080]   Will cover the use of spiritual gifts in a future talk
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:28.500]   But it is the misuse of spiritual gifts, which has led to most of the Corinthian churches
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.520]   issues
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.200]   And my guiding verse for this evening's talk is this one Corinthians 1440. I've put it on the screen
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.760]   But all things should be done
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.160]   decently and
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   In order, let me say it again
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.560]   But all things should be done
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.920]   decently and
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.920]   in order
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:59.640]   The problem with this is that one man's definition of decently and in order will vary from another
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:05.220]   That is maybe why we have close to 50,000 Christian denominations today
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:12.140]   so what I want to try to do is to put aside pastor John's version of
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.860]   decently and in order and
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.460]   attempt to see what the Bible says as
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.120]   described in Paul's first letter to the Corinthians
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.060]   in fact several of the Bible's principles of order within the church and
[00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.660]   Perhaps some of the most important ones are found in the book of one Corinthians
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:40.220]   This evening I'm going to address these particular matters
[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.520]   to show that what we do as a church and
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.900]   How we do them are not arbitrary at all
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.620]   They are based on
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.820]   legitimate religious authority
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.900]   It's
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:02.940]   impossible to read the book of one Corinthians as we've been doing each week and not see Paul's
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.460]   Authority coming through now the amazing thing is
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:11.240]   He was almost certainly writing this in
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.740]   Ephesus
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.740]   Which was 300?
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:23.100]   Miles or so away. It's like me preaching this sermon tonight, but being in Hainan Island right exactly the same and
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.860]   Yet he was 300 miles away, but he was
[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:35.180]   unquestionably still in charge still despite being separated by all this distance
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:41.780]   He was the one in charge of this church and this comes through in his writing. Look at this
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.940]   with a few strokes of the pen
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.820]   Though a few hundred miles away
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.300]   He does this he dis dis fellow
[00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:58.620]   Disfellowships a man who was sleeping with his father's wife. He gives instructions and direction like a general
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.220]   commanding his officers
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.900]   He also gives orders concerning judging
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.580]   lawsuits
[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.820]   fornication marriage and divorce meets offer to idols
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:17.660]   idolatry the Lord's Supper preaching church services taking up a collection for the Jerusalem Saints and the way the
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.500]   Corinthians need to treat the ministry
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.300]   Paul's epistle is just chock full of
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.500]   instructions commands and orders
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:37.620]   Only a person who is dimwitted or intentionally blind would fail to see the authority in Paul's writing
[00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.300]   Paul's instruction on
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.020]   administration within the church are primarily in four chapters
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.900]   namely 9 11 12 and 14
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:53.420]   Although there are bits and pieces in various other sections
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.980]   these particular chapters covered the subjects of
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.100]   ministerial prerogatives
[00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.220]   privileges and rights
[00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.260]   the principle of headship
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.660]   the conduct of the Lord's Supper which we call communion the
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:16.100]   organized division of labor within the church and the order in church services I
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:22.580]   Will cover the last one in my talk on spiritual gifts in two weeks time
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.260]   Today, I will look at the other four
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.540]   Now you may feel these are all pretty
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.340]   fairly basic subjects
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.060]   But we must remember that there are four
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:39.220]   We must remember that the church in Corinth was a very young church
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.620]   It was by this time, maybe only five years old
[00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.540]   That's younger than KFC. I
[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.780]   And it may have been less than that
[00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:55.300]   Accordingly they did not have a great church background
[00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:00.060]   some of them may have been Jews and had background in the synagogue and
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:03.100]   Some of these things may be brought from there
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:05.980]   Not all of them were though
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:12.660]   We have to remember where Corinth was and the makeup of its residents
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.860]   Where they were all from and the backgrounds they had
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:23.620]   Paul was trying desperately and an entirely new situation to bring order out of chaos
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:31.180]   to get people from Egypt Judea Asia Minor Europe and wherever else the people came from
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:33.980]   To all do and speak the same thing
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:40.300]   It was an enormous task it was enormous task to ask people to turn the cell phones off
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.340]   Paul never had cell phones in those days. I'm sure I
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:52.700]   Understand this I used to be pastor the vine and in the vine at time we had 55 different first languages
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.060]   It's difficult to bring them all together
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.780]   The first thing that Paul did of course
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.100]   Was to set down who was in charge
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.740]   He was
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.940]   From there they could work out the details
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:18.980]   There were problems in the Corinthian Church and they had been reported to Paul the situation was becoming worse
[00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.460]   Remember there were various factions
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:27.740]   We saw a few weeks ago for one said I follow Paul and another one says I follow a polis
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.820]   Are you not mere human beings?
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:38.300]   Paul thought the best thing to do in this situation was to set down plain and
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:44.340]   Understandable directions and that is exactly what he does in one Corinthians
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:50.580]   What we're going to do today is we're going to take an overview of these four major sections
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:56.740]   We're not going to try and go through every little detail because that would take too many sermons and I want to do this in only
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:57.780]   one
[00:12:57.780 --> 00:12:59.780]   Therefore if it's okay with you
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:08.540]   We will take the highlights out of this to allow you to understand the principles from which Paul was working
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:11.420]   And I've taught the first section
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:16.100]   ministerial authority rights and privilege
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:24.020]   Paul clearly wrote 1 Corinthians 9 because he felt
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.980]   defensive about his own position
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:33.100]   The reports he had received from those who had come from Corinth
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.300]   Included some that were very critical of Paul himself
[00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.740]   And we get so much of this in the modern church as well
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:49.400]   In other places it talks about how Paul sounded strong in his letters, but in person was rather weak
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:56.540]   He came across strong in those epistles, but when they saw him in person he was not what they expected
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.660]   Perhaps he seemed to be a pushover
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:06.820]   Paul's speech may even have had a lisp or stutter
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.780]   things they continued consider contemptible
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:18.060]   So Paul was feeling a bit defensive and he felt like he needed to set the record straight
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.980]   Paul
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.700]   Could not win
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:32.740]   He went into Corinth he decided not to take their tithes and to work for himself making tents
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:38.820]   We do not know for sure if he was married, but if he were he did not bring her along
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:42.580]   He brought no one with him as far as we know here
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:48.220]   He decided to do these things to help persuade them to the gospel
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:52.420]   Because he did not want to appear demanding things of them
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:15:00.660]   He did all of this out of the goodness of his heart trying to be a good example to them and it all got
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.060]   thrown back into his face
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:08.220]   Paul you are not a biggest person in this church as you say you are
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:11.900]   You do not have the authority you claim
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.220]   Paul then has to set the matter straight
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:21.580]   And in defending himself he explains the principles behind the authority he has
[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:29.300]   As we start you'll notice from this chapter 9 notice the rhetorical questions he asked here
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:33.980]   rhetorical questions are questions that do not expect an answer
[00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.860]   Here we go 1 Corinthians 9
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.180]   Am I not free
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.660]   What he was?
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.660]   Am I not an apostle?
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.020]   Course he was have I not seen Jesus our Lord. He did
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.620]   Are you not my workmanship in the Lord?
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.780]   He then goes on
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.260]   If to others I am NOT an apostle
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.100]   At least I am to you
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:12.180]   For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord. This is my defense to those who would examine me
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.540]   Do we not have the right to eat and drink?
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.820]   Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife or
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:27.780]   Do the other apostles and brothers of the Lord and Cephas or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to?
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.460]   refrain from working for a living
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.540]   Who serves as a soldier at his own expense?
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:41.500]   Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit and who tends a flock without getting some of its milk?
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.820]   Do I say these things on human authority
[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.820]   Does not the law say the same for it is written in the law of Moses?
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:55.460]   You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain. Is it for oxen that God is concerned?
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:01.260]   Does he certainly not speak for our sake it was written for our sake?
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:07.700]   Because the plowman should plow in hope and the fresher fresh in hope of sharing in the crop if
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.780]   We have so spiritual things among you
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:18.260]   Is it too much if we reap material things from you if others share this rightful claim on you? Do we not even more?
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.060]   Nevertheless we have not made use of this right
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:28.460]   But we endure anything rather than put up an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.860]   Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple?
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:40.900]   And those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings in the same way the Lord
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.580]   Commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:54.380]   Interesting Paul's teaching style very infantile. It's the same way you teach a little child
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:01.020]   Do you know what this thing is? Yeah, this is one thing one. Do you know what the other one is?
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.940]   This is another one you put them together. How many do you have to?
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.180]   This is the way Paul is doing this. Am I not free?
[00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:16.540]   Point number one. Am I not an apostle point number two? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord point number three
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.080]   Are you not my work in the Lord point number four?
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.500]   He is just putting point after point after point
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:32.300]   Leading them to an obvious conclusion and the bottom line and the conclusion is in verse 14
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.660]   Those who proclaim the gospel
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:43.540]   Should get their living by the gospel that is the end of the matter for him. However
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:52.700]   The key word in this whole passage this whole section is translated into English as right or power
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.620]   Verse 4 do we not have the right to eat or drink?
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:05.980]   But this word actually means the authority to do something
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.780]   rather than the brute strength
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:14.380]   Authority has more to do with freedom and the right to do something
[00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:22.540]   This word can be translated a right authority power freedom privilege to leave permission power of rule or government
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.380]   It can be translated any one of those ways and even some others
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:32.580]   What he is saying throughout this whole chapter is the Paul
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:37.900]   Certainly have permission from Christ to do these things if he should need to
[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:43.500]   They are part of the package of being a minister and certainly of being an apostle. I
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.140]   Have the awesome privilege of
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:54.220]   Fellowshipping with hundreds of pastors and ministers here in Hong Kong and around the world
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:20:03.180]   I've been honored and pastor Wayne's been part of this to host our international pastors breakfast here in Hong Kong for more than 15 years
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:09.740]   But what I've seen is that many ministers across the globe are
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.540]   Overworked
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.500]   Underpaid and
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.060]   undervalued I
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:22.900]   Have seen church leaders treated so badly in many cases in a way
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:28.980]   You would not even expect the secular world to treat its people. I could tell you some horror stories
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.300]   but I
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.460]   Have on the other hand
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.900]   seen church leaders
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:43.180]   Abuse their positions and cross the line from a perceived God-given right
[00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.660]   to an abuse of position and power
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.660]   Let's be clear
[00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.700]   Neither is correct and
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.940]   Paul is saying that in this chapter
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:02.420]   Christ gives his ministry authority within the church, which includes preaching teaching
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.380]   Organizing having a wife supported through contributions
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:10.700]   Paul's example however
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:18.060]   means that ministers must never abuse their authority by any means so as to bring glory to God and
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:22.980]   Praise no hindrance to the preaching of the gospel. I
[00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:29.660]   Need to move on get off my high horse the next session. I've entitled leadership
[00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.260]   headship or
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.140]   hierarchy
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:38.740]   Paul started off like this be imitators of me as I am of Christ
[00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.540]   That must have spurred a thought in him
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:47.420]   Because then he says now I commend you because you remember me and everything and maintain the traditions
[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.980]   Even as I deliver them to you
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:53.180]   But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.180]   The head of a wife is our husband and the head of Christ is God
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:06.460]   I'm gonna skip the portion the 12 verses regarding head coverings and hair lengths. Brian you're safe. It's okay
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.020]   But I want you to look at this only a joke I
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.260]   think
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.820]   If anyone is inclined to be contentious
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.580]   We have no such practice
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:29.860]   Nor do the churches of God. I want to go back to verse 1 be imitators of me as I am of Christ
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:36.980]   He said imitate the Apostle as he follows Christ leads that in itself is hierarchy
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:39.420]   The Apostle is under Christ
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:45.620]   He then says in verse to maintain the traditions even as I deliver them to you
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:52.060]   In verse 3 he says in effect. There is a natural God ordained order authority
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.460]   There is God the Father there's Christ the Son there is man. There is woman and
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:02.220]   The full thing in verse 16 if anyone is inclined to be contentious
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.780]   We have no such practice
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.780]   Nor to the churches of God
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.500]   This is important
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.820]   One person's contentions are
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:21.820]   Not enough to overturn the long-standing practices of the Church of God
[00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.100]   I need to say this we get a lot this in church, right?
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.300]   one person's contentions one person's whim is
[00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:35.420]   Not enough to overturn the long-standing practices of the Church of God
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.740]   We need to be aware of the flavor of the month
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:45.580]   The flavor of the month in church and jump into the latest fad or fashion
[00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:51.300]   What the Apostle Paul is talking about
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:57.660]   Just because one person wants to introduce something that they may think is a good idea
[00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:06.460]   We should not make the change if it contradicts what has been traditional in the church and cannot be proven to be any better
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.580]   We've had many contentions
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.660]   over this principle headship leadership
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.580]   hierarchy
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:22.340]   But Paul states it clearly and unequivocally as a matter of fact in the next chapter
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.700]   He gives a kind of org chart for the Church of God
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:33.700]   1 Corinthians 12 28 and God has placed in the church first of all Apostles secondly prophets third teachers
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:41.380]   They're miracles then gifts of healing of helping of guidance and of different kinds of tongue. He has given us a ranking
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:47.980]   From top to bottom of authority of power and importance. This is repeated in Ephesians 4
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:56.240]   Now what this organizational chart does what this stacking of leadership on level that will fraud he does is to provide
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.660]   organization
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.660]   It provides order within the church a
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.140]   Tool that God has used from the very beginning
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:10.260]   In fact in 1 Timothy 2 Paul reaches back to Adam and Eve
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:18.900]   The man was created first and then the woman to show the proof that this is the way that God works
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:27.540]   Everywhere in the Old Testament is the same it worked for the patriarchs it worked for Moses and Joshua
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:33.940]   For David and the Kings Elijah and Elisha as well as it worked for the Apostles in the New Testament
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.900]   It is a consistent way that God works
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:42.660]   If we go to John 14 28 we see that Jesus
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:46.140]   recognizes the same thing for himself when he says
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.380]   the Father
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.380]   Is greater than I?
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.180]   There is a chain of command
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:26:04.100]   Jesus proceeds from the father the Holy Spirit proceeds from Jesus. There is a chain of command since God finds that this works
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:07.300]   He has put it in the church
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:15.180]   And one of the things I'm so grateful for us at KFC and KFC I is our deacons here
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:23.540]   You know, I've never in my years in the church known a group of deacons who've been more committed
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:31.100]   To the body of Christ who've worked so hard for the body of Christ and I I'm just so grateful
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.700]   That we have these men and women
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.740]   who fearlessly tirelessly
[00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.940]   support us and
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.820]   I'm so glad that we've got this order this authority in the church
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.580]   Now it doesn't mean there won't be any hurt feelings
[00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.500]   It doesn't mean there won't be any kind of discipline
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:58.580]   However, if it is done for love
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:05.420]   It's gonna produce what God intended it to produce
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:11.020]   And can I just say I've never found a church fellowship as loving as this one
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.980]   This is a loving fellowship if this is done in love
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.620]   if
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:21.860]   We use this principle the best interest of the church could be served
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:27.380]   So I want to assert some of this section the principle of headship
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.820]   provides
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.820]   organization within the church and
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.620]   enforces God's righteous standards
[00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.380]   within the church
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:41.220]   The next section concerns the Lord's Supper, which we call communion
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.420]   It says here
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:50.140]   The way that the Corinthian Church was observing the Lord's Supper was for the worse
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:57.700]   It was divisive. It was unloving it was self-serving and as Paul sums it up. It was unworthy
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.620]   Let's read it
[00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.980]   But in the following instructions
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:07.580]   I do not commend you because when you come together is not a place for the better
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:11.980]   But for the worse for in the first place when you come together as a church
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.980]   I hear there are divisions among you and I believe it in part
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:22.820]   For there may be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.620]   recognized
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:31.220]   In verse 20 when they came together to observe the festival. It was not to keep the Lord's Supper
[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.380]   It was something very different. Let's read it when you come together
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:40.740]   It's not the Lord's Supper you're eating for an eating each one goes ahead of his own meal one goes hungry
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.180]   another gets drunk
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:49.100]   The way he goes on to explain it is almost like some pagan right they were doing
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:52.060]   They were getting drunk
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.860]   It was BYOB and happy hour rolled into one
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:29:00.260]   They brought more than one bottle of communion wine, I guess
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:09.300]   What they were calling the Lord's Supper was unfair because some could eat and some could not some got drunk and some did not
[00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:14.060]   They were actually shaming those who did not have the means to eat with them
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:19.420]   Remember this city was in many ways like Hong Kong
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:22.500]   very diverse
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.780]   With very poor people and very rich people
[00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.380]   There were Egyptians Jews Syrians and more from all over the Mediterranean
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:35.180]   All with different customs who brought their ideas into the Church of God
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:37.700]   evidently all mixed together
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:46.820]   They were having this out and out knees up to the point that people were actually getting drunk
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:54.180]   During what should have been the communion service. I think I'm quite glad we have grape juice
[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.940]   What
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:03.340]   Paul essentially says is their practice was dishonoring Christ in the worst way his supreme sacrifice
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.220]   Does not seem to have been entered into their thinking at all. He had to remind them
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.060]   Look, this is why we come together for the Lord's Supper is the honor Christ
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.500]   He's to take the bread and remember his body and his take the wine
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.820]   I remember he shed blood and all the things that go with it
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:26.320]   He was telling them it was to be a sober evening in more ways than one. He had to lay the Lord down to them
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:33.340]   He told them that if they were spiritually discerning really spiritually discerning they would know better
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:38.540]   But they were such carnal people. He had to command them and judge them
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.220]   Look how he concludes this section
[00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:47.820]   So then brothers when you come together to eat wait for one another if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.960]   So when you come together, it will not be for judgment
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.900]   About the other things I will give direction
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.460]   when I come in
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:57.620]   summary
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:02.120]   The church should not treat the Lord's Supper like a potluck
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.860]   or a feast
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:11.840]   When we take communion it is a sober commemoration of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and should be
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.100]   Observed with the respect it deserves
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.460]   My last section is
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.700]   entitled organization and
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:26.060]   Division of labor within the church. I gotta tell you we could do a whole series on this one
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.260]   I hope you're not rushing off afterwards
[00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:34.660]   Look at these verses from 1 Corinthians 12
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.500]   For just as the body is
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:43.900]   One and has many members and all the members of the body low many are one body. So it is with Christ
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:52.080]   For in one spirit, we were all baptized into one body Jews and Greeks slaves and frees and we're all made to drink of the one
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.460]   spirit
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:59.140]   Verse 18, but as it is God arranged the members of the body each one of them as he chose
[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:04.340]   verse 27 now you are the body of Christ and
[00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.260]   individually members of it
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:13.340]   Paul uses the analogy of the body to show how the church is organized and how is directed
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.380]   The body yours mine everybody's is directed by the head
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:24.980]   All the functions of the body begin in the mind and go through the nerves to the rest of the body and those parts perform
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.380]   their functions
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:30.020]   the body of Christ is the same way he is the head and
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:35.260]   He sends orders through his Holy Spirit to the rest of the body
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:42.900]   Since those are in his body have the Holy Spirit and can receive and be inspired by the Holy Spirit
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.100]   Those members do what Christ tells them to do
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:51.560]   Everything works together because we are all working towards the same goal
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:33:00.140]   Paul says here putting it in my own words that the body of Christ is a spiritual organism
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:06.220]   Every part has a place and a function every part has a place and a function and he
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:14.060]   Emphasizes that these places and these functions are determined by God the Father himself and are directed by Jesus Christ himself
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.380]   They are involved
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:23.520]   The father puts us where he wants us and then Jesus Christ says, okay dad. I can use this person and he gives his orders
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.580]   No person is
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.580]   Unneeded if God has put him into the body of Christ
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.500]   To sum up this section the Church of God is
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:45.220]   Organized by God under Christ to fulfill God's purpose in the church each member each member
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:51.220]   Each member has a place and a function that are necessary to reach the goal
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:55.940]   Wherever we have been placed
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.220]   We should be content
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:01.820]   I'll say that again
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.260]   Wherever we have been placed
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:10.300]   We should be content if we desire something more we need to wait for God's providence
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:14.500]   But in the meantime
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:18.060]   Continue working but
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:22.700]   Where I started
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.740]   But all things should be done decently
[00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:29.060]   and
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.060]   in order
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:33.100]   This verse comes as Paul
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.740]   concludes his focus on
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.700]   spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 14 by
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:45.140]   Encouraging the whole church to come to worship ready to contribute
[00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:50.340]   But to do so in an orderly way
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:54.940]   So that people can be edified and
[00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:59.340]   built up in their faith
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:04.380]   Can I ask the worship band to come back and I'll sort of stand please
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:11.580]   What is it
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:26.620]   I'm desperate for us to be the church that Christ wants us to not just for us
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.900]   But for our city for our world
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.940]   You may have noticed we're in a mess
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:39.300]   Governments all around the world are in a mess
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:46.500]   We're gonna sing this song heal our land it's a prayer I
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:55.060]   Want to pray for us before we sing I
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.500]   Want to really as it were complete this picture together
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:06.820]   Because it's not my words it's not a sermon
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:13.100]   We need the Spirit of God to come upon the church
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:20.660]   To heal us there are so many divisions in the body of Christ I
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:25.780]   Said earlier, that's why we got 50,000 denominations
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.780]   50,000 I
[00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:35.740]   Say so many times you've heard me said there's only one church in Hong Kong Church of Jesus Christ
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:43.740]   We're gonna pray now Spirit of God fall on your church
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:48.460]   Pour out your presence
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:37:00.660]   Bible says if my people will call by my name will humble themselves and pray I will hear their prayer. I
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.340]   Will come from heaven and I will heal their land
[00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:08.240]   So I'm gonna ask you before we sing just to stretch your hands out in front of you
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:17.120]   When I asked the Holy Spirit to come to us we need this the church in Hong Kong needs this
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:26.140]   Father we thank you for the church. We thank you for the church you
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:30.780]   Ordained we thank you Lord for the way you spoke about order in the church
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:35.420]   We thank you for this body
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:43.660]   Thank you for our deacons I thank you for pastor Peter I thank you for those who
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:48.700]   Have served this church for more than 35 years
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.700]   I
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:57.780]   Just see us here in Admiralty in this place I
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:05.700]   See us as beacon I see us as a lighthouse for this city I
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:12.820]   Don't want to take it for granted where we are here, but God has put us here for a purpose
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.860]   Lord in a city, which is so divided
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.620]   Politically socially economically
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:29.780]   For families that are divided
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:36.940]   We say Lord would you pour out your spirit on this land
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:44.580]   Would you start with us Lord we are open to receive we are open to be used
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.060]   Pour out your spirit on this church we pray
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:57.260]   Pour out your spirit on our leaders on our helpers
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:07.500]   I
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.780]   Pray Lord that we would become the church that you saw
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:21.260]   In your mind on that day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came and lit the flame and the church began
[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:32.740]   May we be that church and may we be a beacon here for the people of this city and this nation
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:36.420]   In Jesus name
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.220]   Let's sing this song heal our land
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.800]   (gentle music)
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.860]   you
