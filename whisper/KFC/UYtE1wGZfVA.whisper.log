[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.840]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.840]   It's great to be back.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.840]   How long has it been now?
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.840]   Four months, actually.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.400]   People ask, "How come you have such a long maternity leave?"
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.520]   I don't.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.360]   It's maternity plus holiday.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.800]   So I'm finally back, and I'm really glad to be here.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.640]   It's the first time I am sharing a message where my baby's out of me.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.800]   Because a few times I think I was pregnant while I was doing it.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.480]   So, yeah, I'm just happy to be here, and I've missed all of you.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.320]   And it was so good that I got to join the retreat, and we got to just hang out for a
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.320]   little bit.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.640]   So don't mind my voice.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.320]   It has been like this ever since the baby was born, for obvious reasons.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.000]   Not enough sleep.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.920]   But let us continue today on what we've just seen.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.280]   So today we are on the parables.
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280]   What is this about?
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.640]   The tenants.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.360]   And as you just saw, I think it's a parable that we are either quite familiar with, or
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.880]   it's not hard to understand.
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.260]   Because there was a landlord, and he planted this vineyard where there's a lot of produce.
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.920]   But instead of doing it himself, he has hired these other farmers to help him.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.760]   Unfortunately, though, at the time of harvest, when it was the time to give the goods, or
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.400]   at least a part of it, back to the landowner, it seemed like they were not willing.
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.840]   Because the very first one, what did they do to him?
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.840]   Beat him up.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.560]   And the second one, also, except in a shameful way, according to what the Bible said.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.960]   And the third one as well.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.400]   I mean, we're not quite sure what's the difference between beating someone up and hitting him.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.020]   But all we know is that they've treated them harshly.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.360]   And so the landlord says, "Okay, perhaps I'll send my son.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.380]   They'll respect him, perhaps."
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.640]   So he sends his way, and what happens?
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.900]   Kills him.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:16.280]   And so Jesus says this parable, and of course we know it's actually filled with symbols
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.840]   and metaphors.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.040]   So let us look at what each of those stand for.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.920]   So the very first one, we're going to the next slide.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.920]   Someone at the slides.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   Oh, there we go.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.280]   All right, so the landlord, yes, baby.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.680]   So the landlord stands for God.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.160]   Okay, he is the landowner.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.760]   And now the tenants, what do they stand for?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.760]   God's people.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.200]   So it could be just the leaders or most likely all of Israelites.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.720]   God's chosen people.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.360]   Now the vineyard, what does it stand for?
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.560]   This is the inheritance or the blessing, the favor that God has for his people.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.240]   And the landlord's son, I think this might be obvious, it is on Easter, it is Jesus.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.400]   And who are these other people that eventually, because of what they've done, they will give...
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.520]   I'm very distracted by the way.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.880]   What are they going to give them?
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.400]   These Gentiles.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.800]   And so these people are actually those that don't belong to the Lord.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.520]   So the Lord is saying, "Since you guys are not giving me the crops that I deserve, I'm
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.900]   going to give this land over to these other people, the Gentiles."
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.800]   Now the question comes, okay, the important question.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.240]   What does the fruits stand for?
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.240]   What do you guys think?
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.240]   Any idea?
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:52.520]   What do the fruits stand for in this particular parable?
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   No idea?
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520]   The kingdom?
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   Okay.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.980]   Any other?
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.980]   So what is it?
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.980]   Because think about it.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:09.440]   So the landlord, God, is going to these tenants and he wanted to ask for these fruits.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.040]   So what do you think God is asking of these people?
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.960]   Because if we know what God's asking of these people, perhaps we'll know what God is asking
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.480]   of us as well.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.360]   So no one...
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.360]   No brave soul.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.220]   Okay, good.
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.720]   Because if you already know the answer, I guess we can go now, right?
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:39.400]   All right, so let's go through the scripture to see what fruits God is desiring from us.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:48.040]   Now if we read the scripture in verse 13, it says here, "After sending out the few servants
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:53.840]   with no fruits, then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do?
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.720]   I will send my son whom I love.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.200]   Perhaps they will respect him.'"
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:09.360]   Now could it be possible that all along God wanted from these people were respect?
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:17.320]   Now the gifts or these fruits represented a way for them to show God that they respected
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.320]   him.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.200]   Now you might be like, "I'm not really sure if I'm getting this."
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.640]   Okay, think about it this way.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.800]   Wives, how many wives do we have here?
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   Wives?
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.800]   Okay, we've just got a few.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.720]   All right, there you go.
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.120]   What is it that we want sometimes?
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.400]   How about a flower?
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.320]   Not a flower, but a bunch of flowers.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.320]   Maybe jewelry.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.400]   Okay, a small gift from our husbands.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.480]   Why?
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.800]   Is it really that we want some flowers?
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.800]   Jewelry?
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.360]   I mean, yeah, I mean, we wouldn't mind those things at all, right?
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.440]   But more is actually the heart that we're looking for.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.040]   The gifts represent the heart.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:03.800]   And in the same way, these fruits, they're representing the heart behind these tenants.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:12.360]   And when God says, or it's represented by this landlord, he says, "Perhaps they will
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.480]   respect him."
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.360]   What God asks of us really is respect.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.840]   Now he begs the question, "Do we respect him?"
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:34.800]   I'm pretty sure we're not going to beat up someone, hopefully, don't beat up anyone who
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.360]   works at the church.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.920]   Or you're not going to beat up your brothers and sister?
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.880]   And if you're unsure, please come and talk to us afterwards, okay?
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.880]   We haven't done that.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.760]   So I mean, are we respecting God just because we haven't hit anybody around us?
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.600]   We haven't treated someone badly?
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.920]   Is that what it means here?
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.400]   What do you guys think?
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   Yes or no?
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.800]   No.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.120]   So what does it mean then to respect?
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.720]   What does that look like?
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.440]   Well, maybe we can first look at what it's like to disrespect him.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.480]   Now I have a few questions for you to answer in your heart.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.320]   I mean, do we habitually sleep through sermons?
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.440]   All right, everybody's eyes are open at this moment in time.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.880]   Good.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.720]   Because I've just asked that question now.
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.960]   Or do we habitually come in worship late or distracted by our phones?
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:38.640]   Or maybe I look like I'm present, but I'm thinking about something else.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.200]   Or we can't find the time to pray, and you know where we end up praying?
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.960]   On top of the toilet seat.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.200]   You know, that moment, you know, "Oh, finally, I'm done with this, I'm done with that, I
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.960]   guess I've got nothing else better to do.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.960]   You know what?
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.640]   I'm going to pray."
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.360]   Or how much time do we spend on social media, on our own hobbies?
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.880]   Maybe 10 times, 100 times more than we spend with God, praying or reading the Bible with
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.880]   him.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:15.480]   So it really begs the question, do we respect God?
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:21.120]   I mean, do you change appointments with people that you said you would meet up with very
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.000]   often?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.160]   Not actually as often as you would change the appointments with God.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:32.240]   I mean, if we're busy, we're like, "God, you know, I was going to, I planned to talk to
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.160]   you and read the Bible at 8, but you know what?
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.840]   I overslept, so I've got an appointment at 9.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.320]   I'll make it up later today."
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.040]   And then by the time we know it, "Oh, it's 1 a.m.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.400]   God, you know me.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.920]   I'm really tired right now.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.520]   How about tomorrow morning?
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.520]   Tomorrow morning?
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.520]   All right.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.920]   Tomorrow morning it happens again.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.880]   And what do we know?
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.640]   By the time we actually get to him, it's three months down the road."
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.920]   But we wouldn't do that to a friend or definitely not to our bosses.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.580]   So what does it say about our respect to God?
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.840]   Do we really respect him?
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:12.000]   Now that we know kind of what disrespect kind of looks like, why don't we have a look to
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.400]   see in the scripture, how is it that they have disrespected him so that we know how
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.760]   we can respect God?
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.280]   Because the way we think we're respecting God might be very different.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.260]   Because all these things that I've mentioned, they're just items.
[00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.360]   They're just actions, right?
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.120]   I mean, is it wrong to pray on the toilet seat?
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.840]   Because now you're like, "I would never pray on the toilet seat again."
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   It's good.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.320]   It's not a bad thing, okay?
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.100]   So it's not the specific actions that we're talking about here, but it's the heart.
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.300]   So let's look at the scripture to see what kind of heart we need to actually respect
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.740]   God.
[00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.940]   Now the first servant sent by the owner, I mean, how did he treat him?
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.380]   We all mentioned that.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.980]   He didn't give the servants anything.
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.300]   Instead, he beat him up.
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.340]   Now what do you think was going through the minds of the tenants when they were beating
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:07.500]   up this servant?
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.340]   Why would they beat him up?
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:19.460]   Why would you beat up someone sent by a land that you were given to farm?
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.260]   Why would you beat him up?
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.260]   Thought about that?
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260]   Nope.
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.260]   Because you wouldn't beat him up, right?
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:38.420]   Well, the very fact that they beat him up meant that they were not satisfied.
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.460]   They were not satisfied with this land.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.860]   "Yeah, sure, I've got a piece of land I can farm on, but you know what?
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:48.260]   I'm not satisfied because I've got to give fruits to this landlord.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.260]   You know what?
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.060]   When I'll be satisfied?
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.900]   When this land belongs to me, I'll be satisfied."
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:58.980]   So what does it say?
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:06.380]   Do you know that the first path to respecting God is to be content?
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.540]   Is to be content.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.340]   Can you see the goodness of whatever it is that you're going through?
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.860]   Because if you're not content, you know what?
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.980]   You won't be grateful either.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.860]   You'll be holding grudges, and you won't be able to respect God.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.260]   Now you might be going through a tough time, whether it's your job.
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.340]   Maybe you're looking for a job.
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.840]   There's no job.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.060]   Maybe you're looking for a partner, but there's no partner.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.980]   Maybe you're married and you want to be unmarried.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:41.100]   So you're going through a tough time, like an illness, and you're like, "When is it that
[00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.380]   I can get better?"
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.300]   And it hasn't happened yet.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.260]   And you know what's in our mind?
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:54.300]   We're like, "If only the blank, fill it in, whatever it is that you want happens, I will
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.740]   be happy."
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.700]   And meanwhile, you know what we'll do?
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.620]   We'll ask God.
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:07.940]   Our favorite word is, no, no, our favorite, some people's favorite, not yours, is why?
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:09.300]   Why is this happening to me?
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.860]   Why is everyone getting a job and I'm not getting a job?
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:16.700]   Why is everybody's wife so good to me, but my wife, I'm not sure.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.700]   Why?
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.700]   Why does everybody is healthy, but I'm not?
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.660]   And we always have this question, it's like, "Why, Lord?"
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:28.700]   And actually, the moment we ask why, and the more often we do it, you know what?
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.580]   We're discontent.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.700]   We're not satisfied.
[00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.700]   We're not.
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.900]   "Give me more, Lord.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.620]   If you're all knowing, if you're all able, why am I stuck in this situation?
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.700]   Why haven't you done something yet?"
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:49.540]   And because of that, I want to say is actually a disrespect to our God.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.380]   You might say, though, "Well, I'm not disrespecting God.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.580]   I'm not like complaining against Him.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.060]   I'm just complaining about the situation."
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:04.820]   But if you think in your head, "But wait a minute, God's all knowing, He's all able,
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.060]   but I'm stuck here."
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.620]   What kind of conclusion are you going to draw?
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:17.120]   You're going to draw a conclusion that maybe God's good to everybody else, but not necessarily
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.120]   all that good to you.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.900]   He may be 99.9% good to you.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.100]   And maybe that's what's happening here with the tenants.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.020]   "Yeah, I have a land I can work on.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:29.220]   But wait, I have to give back something to you.
[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.300]   If I own it, it'll be okay."
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.700]   And actually, that's exactly what happened at the Garden of Eden.
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.460]   What happened there?
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.820]   God gave Adam and Eve all the fruits and all the trees.
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:49.540]   They can eat from all of them except one tree, but that's the tree they want.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:54.780]   Actually today, I'm going to share with you about a man named Nick.
[00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:57.300]   I cannot pronounce his last name.
[00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.220]   You show the photo because someone can't help me.
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:04.860]   Vigidi, yes.
[00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.100]   Go to John afterwards to ask for his last name or Google this.
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.660]   Now, he is a man, as you see, without arms and legs.
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.820]   And he was born like that.
[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:22.420]   And actually, when he was around 10 years old, he was in so much pain that he attempted
[00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.740]   suicide.
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.660]   And he was born in a Christian family, and he asked God all the time, "God, why can't
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.460]   I have arms and legs?"
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.420]   Which is a very valid question, don't you think?
[00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.880]   Everybody else has it.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.780]   And so all he ever wanted was arms and legs.
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.460]   So he would pray every day, "God, please give me arms and legs."
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:41.460]   And then he'll fall asleep.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.700]   And the next day he wakes up, I'm like, "Oh, have I grown arms and legs?"
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.700]   No.
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.140]   He was very, very disappointed.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.140]   And he said, "God, why?
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.140]   Why?"
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.660]   And actually, he said, "One day," which is at a meeting that I actually met him face
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:57.460]   to face in a big hall.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:02.140]   And he said, "One day," he said, "You know what?
[00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:06.660]   I thought that if I have arms and legs, I'll be happy and content.
[00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.640]   But then I look around.
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:15.540]   Everybody else has arms and legs, and there's so many of them that are upset.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.420]   They might even have depression."
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:24.740]   So he realized it's not the arms and the legs that make someone content and happy.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:32.260]   And he says, "If I have God, and if God is giving me this, I shall be content."
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:38.540]   And from that day forward, never again did he think about committing suicide.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.660]   And you know what?
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:46.260]   Now he has become a world-renowned motivational speaker.
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:54.140]   And he has helped so many people with disabilities, people who are going through hardships.
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.380]   And you know what?
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:00.240]   That was the situation that God allowed him to be.
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.900]   And it actually allowed him to glorify God.
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.060]   He helped so many people.
[00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:10.500]   And so in the same way, can we be content?
[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:17.940]   Maybe there's something that you still want God to give you to do.
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:22.060]   But can we be content in that moment in time?
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.100]   Now I don't want to dismiss and say, "Oh, but I'm in so much pain."
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.540]   Of course.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.780]   God never said that it's not painful.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.340]   But during...
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.660]   I mean, can you imagine not having arms and legs?
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.300]   Is that easy?
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:39.300]   I mean, for some people who are going through divorce, is that easy?
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.740]   For some people who cannot find a job for a very long time, or have a boss that gives
[00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:46.980]   you a hard time every day, is that easy?
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.980]   No.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.140]   And we're not saying that we're going to dismiss all of those.
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:57.300]   But we are saying in the midst, if we can hold on to the fact that all things work together
[00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:05.460]   for those who love God, just like Nick, then we can be content.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:14.500]   Now let's read on to see when the second servant, as we see, it was sent, and we can read about
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.060]   it in verse 11.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:22.860]   Now the tenants beat him, and he treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.
[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.220]   Now you know in those times, when they're talking about killing of these messengers,
[00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.780]   they're really meaning like prophets that have came ahead, or messengers for God that
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:37.300]   they have despised and even killed, or they didn't listen to them.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:43.420]   So really in here, we're seeing that not only are they beating the servants up, but that
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.740]   they're treating them shamefully.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:51.820]   Now the second path to respecting God is to embrace God.
[00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.380]   Do you embrace God and his words?
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.620]   Or do you find that to be shameful?
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.620]   What do I mean by that?
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.980]   I mean, let's say you're with some coworkers or your friends.
[00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.900]   Do you pray quietly just so they are not aware that you're a Christian?
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.700]   Would you do that?
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:12.660]   Or when something happens, would you out loud and say, "Oh, praise the Lord.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.940]   He has helped me."
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.940]   Or are you going to go, "Praise the Lord.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.140]   Don't let anybody know I'm a Christian."
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:23.660]   Or when something that your friends or your peers are doing is wrong, will you come and
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.620]   say, "Hey, you know, the Bible actually teaches us not to."
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.700]   I mean, not in a way where we're judging others, but in a way where you share what you believe.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.700]   Would we do that?
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:35.340]   Or we're like, "Oh, let's not rock the boat."
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.080]   Or maybe even when the Bible tells us, "Pray for those who are sick."
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.940]   Are you willing to go and pray?
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.420]   Or do you secretly think in your heart, "Wait a minute.
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:49.300]   If I pray and that person never gets better, it kind of looks bad on me.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.300]   Should I still do that?"
[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.500]   Do you find his word shameful?
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.260]   Or do you find his word being the truth?
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.180]   I don't know if he's going to get better, but God says, "I can pray and he can be healed.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.500]   I'm going to go."
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.940]   God says, "I can share the gospel."
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.380]   And then that person would believe.
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.940]   And rather or not he believes or not, it's not up to me.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.940]   It's up to God.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.700]   I'm not shameful about it.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.700]   I'm going to tell Jesus.
[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.780]   I'm going to tell other people about Jesus.
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.500]   And they are going to say, "You're so low-toe."
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.500]   You know what low-toe?
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.500]   John, what's that?
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.500]   Outdated.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.620]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.380]   Probably not.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.140]   So people are going to think, "Oh, don't stop telling me about...
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.140]   Stop talking about Jesus.
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.100]   It's so outdated."
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.780]   But will we still want to share at the right times?
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:45.020]   So it really makes us think, are we shameful of the cross?
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.940]   Or are we so proud of it?
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:51.260]   Are you proud of it?
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.020]   Are you proud to tell people, "I'm a Christian"?
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.460]   Are you proud to tell people, "Yeah, I mean, I don't fool around with men or women"?
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:04.260]   Are you proud to tell people about your belief and what you do?
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:11.380]   Now I think one of the prophets that are just a great example is the prophet Daniel.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:16.620]   Now prophet Daniel, he was somebody who prayed to the Lord every day for three times.
[00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.380]   And his rival knew about it and wanted to trap him.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.220]   So they persuaded the king to say, "Oh, you know, anyone who doesn't just worship you,
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.220]   you should kill him."
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.060]   And the king thought, "Oh, that's a great idea.
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.420]   Let's do that."
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:36.860]   And so he has put in an order, "I will kill anybody who worships other people or gods."
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.180]   And what does Daniel do?
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:48.220]   He opens the window so everybody can see him, and he prays to the Lord three times a day.
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:58.060]   He is proud of God, and even meaning to take his life will not stop him from being proud
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.060]   of this God.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.060]   Are we proud?
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.900]   Are we willing to tell everybody, "We're Christian.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.780]   I follow Jesus"?
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:13.620]   Or will we be like the tenants, finding it to be shameful?
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:20.620]   Now as we read on to the third one, we see that this time they've beat him, and then
[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.820]   the landlord sends his son.
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:25.660]   And then eventually he kills him.
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.580]   Now this one you might be thinking, "Aha, this time, I'm sure we've got it right, because
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.420]   we haven't killed Jesus.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.420]   It's not us, okay?
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:34.860]   It's got nothing to do with us.
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.060]   We did not kill Jesus.
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.500]   We did not kill the son that was sent by God."
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:47.540]   And I'm not saying you did, but what does it say, what does it mean when the tenants
[00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.420]   killed the son?
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:53.020]   What kind of heart did he have?
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.780]   What kind of heart is that?
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:04.220]   It means that it's a total rejection, it's a total way of saying, "I don't want to have
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.220]   anything to do with you.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:11.340]   I want you out of my life, out of my sight, never to come back dead."
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.860]   That's what killing means.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.180]   Do not be involved with me.
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:21.180]   Now you're like saying, "But we're all, well, most of us here are Christians.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.900]   So what does that have to do with us?
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.140]   How is that disrespecting?
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.180]   I'm not going to do that."
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:36.580]   I want to say the third path to respecting God is to invite God, is to invite him into
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.460]   every part of your life.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:43.580]   I mean, it's one thing to say we're Christians and live in our own way, and it's another
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:49.940]   thing entirely to be Christians and invite God to be in every aspect, every decision
[00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.940]   you make.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.620]   Okay, maybe not the ones where you're going to do char siu fan or the cup noodles, okay?
[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:59.340]   But the decisions, the big ones.
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.020]   Which school would you go to?
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:02.780]   Which courses would you take?
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.540]   Should I date this person?
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:07.020]   What businesses should I go into?
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.660]   How can I glorify God?
[00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.820]   I'm in a broken relationship right now.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.380]   How do I restore it?
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.820]   Would you use your way or God's way?
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.460]   And here we say invite God.
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:20.620]   It's not just a matter of, you know how we usually do it?
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.060]   "God, I've got this business issue.
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.600]   Can you help me fix it?"
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.620]   And by the way, I'm really tired, so I'm going to go to bed now.
[00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:29.620]   Good night.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.020]   Or we have another issue.
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.620]   "Oh, I'm fighting with my husband or wife.
[00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.620]   You know what?
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.180]   Please help me take care of it.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.180]   Good night."
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.620]   I mean, what do we usually do most of the time?
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.420]   It seems like we just throw the problem at God and say, "Okay, what should I do about
[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:45.420]   it?
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.940]   By the way, I didn't hear anything, so I'm just going to go about my own ways, and I'm
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.020]   just going to do what I think is best."
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.420]   So what does it mean to invite God?
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.360]   How can we invite God into our lives?
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.140]   Not just by asking a question, "How do I solve this?
[00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:04.380]   How do I do that?
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.580]   Should I do this?"
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:07.940]   And most of us will say, "Well, I didn't hear God.
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:11.020]   I'm not quite sure what he wants me to do."
[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.300]   Right?
[00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.620]   But what does it mean actually to invite God?
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:19.600]   It actually has an action to go with it.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:26.400]   If you really desire to know what God wants you to do, you're actually going to put aside
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.400]   time.
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.080]   Not just asking a question, not even saying, "Lord, fill me up," and then go and play your
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.720]   video games or play tennis.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.720]   Right?
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:38.480]   That's for me.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.200]   But instead, what do we do?
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   We'll spend time.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.780]   We're going to start reading on it to see what does the Bible say about businesses.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.240]   What does the Bible say about marriages?
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.600]   What does the Bible say about forgiveness?
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.040]   What does the Bible say about workplace?
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.920]   We're going to go in there and then study the word.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:09.480]   And also, we can talk to other people we think that loves God and are able to understand
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.480]   his words.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:18.460]   We can read a book on it or watch a YouTube so that we could understand what God's heart
[00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:19.460]   is.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:25.500]   Honestly, it's not good enough for us to just ask and leave it there because that's not
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.420]   really involving God.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.940]   That's just a way for us to think we're involving God.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.100]   But instead, we need to put that time in.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:41.860]   Does God change the decisions you make?
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.820]   I want to ask that question again.
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.380]   Does God change the decisions you make?
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:54.620]   Or do you make a decision and then ask God to fit in it and say, "Yeah, I think God said
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.620]   yes."
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:57.680]   I mean, that was a pretty lady there.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.020]   I think God said yes.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.760]   I think she blinked at me.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.100]   I think that was a yes.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:15.380]   If we continue to live our lives the way we want to and not actually involving God in
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.700]   it, then I'm worried.
[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:25.080]   I am worried because it might mean that we're not respecting him.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:34.360]   And in this scripture, what happens to those that don't respect him?
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:41.240]   He will then give the inheritance to someone else.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:51.960]   And now, today we're celebrating Easter, Good Friday, Sunday, when the resurrection happens.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:57.060]   Today we looked at three points to see how we can respect God.
[00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:04.840]   It is to be content, to embrace God, not to be shameful about it, and to invite God.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.140]   And you know what?
[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:15.960]   Jesus on the cross has actually done the exact same thing for us.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:21.000]   Do you know that God is content with you?
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.940]   God is content with you.
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:30.320]   There is nothing more that you do, nothing less that you do, that will make him love
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.180]   you any more or less.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.200]   He is content with who you are.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.880]   And he takes you as you are.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:46.600]   He doesn't say, "Oh yeah, maybe when John, when he criticizes less, yeah, I'll love him."
[00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:53.720]   Or he doesn't say, "Yeah, when Johnny takes up an extra sport, I'll love him more."
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.520]   Maybe it's the other way around, but no, no, right?
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.520]   Or maybe he won't say, "Yeah, when Michelle reads a few more chapters of Bible a day,
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.160]   yeah, I will be pleased."
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.160]   No.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.400]   Then why are we treating God like that?
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.720]   Why are we saying that, "God, if you only give me that, then I'll love you, then I'll
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.760]   trust you, I'll believe you."
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:22.080]   Why are we treating God like that when he's not treating us like that?
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:29.600]   He has already loved us the way we are, including the mistakes that you've made, including the
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.400]   regrets that you didn't want to do.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.280]   He loves you.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:42.480]   And if he has already done it on the cross to be content with you, let us return that
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:49.160]   by being content with God, being content in the situation that he has given to you.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:55.320]   And the second thing is embracing God, and God has already embraced us.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:58.640]   Do you know how he has done that?
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   Instead of shamefully saying, which he could, "What a sinner you are.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.760]   How could you have said that?
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.280]   How could you have done that?
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.480]   That was immoral.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.480]   That was wrong.
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.800]   You're a sinner, a failure."
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.160]   You know what?
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.160]   God doesn't do that.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.920]   He never for a moment shames us.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:30.140]   I mean, most of us will remember the story where there was a woman involved in the adultery.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:36.600]   Everybody wanted to stone her, but what does Jesus do?
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.520]   Jesus doesn't say anything.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.800]   He just says, "Just don't do it anymore.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.680]   Your sins are forgiven."
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:51.200]   God never shames us, then why are we ashamed of the gospel?
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   Why is it that we find it, you know, "Let's not share with that person about Jesus.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   It'll look bad on me."
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:03.560]   But God's not like that.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:11.280]   And lastly, I'm asking us to invite God in our lives, but you know what?
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:23.160]   What he has done on the cross, he has invited us into eternity, into the banquet where we
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:28.080]   will sit with him.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.800]   What kind of an invitation is that?
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.080]   What kind of an invitation is that?
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:43.280]   You and I both have it, because Jesus died on the cross, and we're invited to talk to
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.280]   God now.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.240]   We're invited to sit with him.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.720]   We're invited into eternity.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:31:02.400]   And we are not even willing to invite him, to ask him, "Oh, what shall I do with my career?
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.620]   What shall I do with my broken relationship?
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.800]   What shall I do with my child that I'm trying to raise up?
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   What shall I do?"
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.920]   Won't you invite him into your life?
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:24.800]   Because he has already invited you into eternity, invited you to a banquet that we were never
[00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:30.240]   fit to go into.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:36.480]   I think it really begs the question, do we respect God?
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:44.800]   And I really hope that we are content with whatever it is that we're going through, knowing
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.080]   that God is here.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.040]   If he has allowed it, there's some good that will come out of it.
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:56.840]   To not be shameful of the gospel, and to invite God at all times into our lives.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:08.200]   Actually, could I invite the band to come up as they play?
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:15.080]   I want to extend an invitation to you.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:23.840]   My very first invitation is to those who has never committed their lives to Jesus.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:29.880]   On this Easter day, I want to invite you.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:38.360]   I want to invite you to ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins, which he has already done
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:44.080]   on the cross, and ask him to be your Lord and Savior.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:47.240]   Because he has already sent out that invitation.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:33:00.000]   He has asked, "Would you, my child, whom I love, whom I'm content with, will you come
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.160]   so that I could be your Lord?
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.160]   I could take care of you.
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:14.520]   I could love you and have a relationship with you."
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.880]   Is there anybody here tonight who hasn't done that yet?
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.480]   I give you just a moment.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:30.280]   If that is in your heart, "Yeah, I heard about Jesus sometime.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.640]   I might have even gone to church for a while.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:40.840]   But I'm not really quite sure if I've committed myself to him."
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:46.920]   But if today you say, "I want to receive Jesus.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:52.440]   I want to receive the love that he has for me.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:34:01.360]   I want to answer to the invitation to eternity, forgiveness of sin."
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:11.040]   May I ask you to just put your hand up wherever you're sitting.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.400]   Is there anybody like that?
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:20.600]   God has extended his invitation to you.
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:35.920]   You can put your hand up at where you're sitting and you say, "Lord, I'm taking on this invitation.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:46.760]   I want to be with the God who created the universe, who sent his son to die for my sins
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.400]   so that I might live."
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:35:05.960]   Is there anybody here that would want to receive this invitation?
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:20.680]   The gospel is something that we're proud of, not ashamed of.
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.680]   Is there anybody?
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:25.040]   We just want to pray for you, if that is you.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:41.240]   Now I want to extend another invitation.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:56.160]   I want to invite those who after hearing the parable of the tenants, who saw ourselves
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.520]   at times when we're not content.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:12.840]   At times when we even wonder if God really loves us.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:18.200]   And those who are ashamed of the gospel, who have shied away many times to even tell people
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:28.760]   that they're Christians.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:43.840]   And those who feel like they've really disrespected God in some time, but are now willing to just
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:50.080]   embrace God, to follow his ways.
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:37:05.920]   Re-committing that heart, inviting God to take over all the aspects of your life.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:12.400]   Maybe there were times when you didn't, but you want to now.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:25.320]   Would you put up your hand to show us, to show the Lord that you're willing to be content
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:36.240]   with him, to embrace him, to be involved in every part of your life.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   I see your hand.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   I see your hand.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:44.200]   Is there anyone else?
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:50.680]   Tell God, I want to respect you.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:56.720]   All that you've done on the cross for me.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.880]   I want to repay you.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.880]   Not in any monetary sense.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:08.560]   I want to give you my heart.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:24.720]   Dear Heavenly Father, oh the God of the universe, you love us so.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:33.800]   How is it possible that you send your beloved son, seeing how the tenants have already beat
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:42.440]   up one after another, and yet you're willing.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:52.160]   Father, we pray that, forgive us when we were not content, when we're angry at you, when
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:59.240]   we misunderstood you, to be someone who doesn't love us enough.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.960]   Forgive us, Father.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:07.560]   Forgive us the times when we were ashamed of the gospel.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:14.920]   Don't even want to spend time on it, or your words.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:24.800]   Forgive us when we just live our lives without you really being involved at all.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:33.520]   Are we really doing things any different than if we had not said that we believe in you?
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:47.760]   Father, we pray, help us to desire you more.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:57.200]   Help us to see that you are what we want.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:02.320]   Help us, Father, to follow your ways all the days of our lives.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.920]   Let us be content, because we have Jesus.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.120]   What else will make us content?
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:21.840]   So Father, tonight we come before you, offering our hearts to you once again.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.480]   Thank you for loving us the way you do.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:27.880]   Amen.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.460]   (gentle music)
