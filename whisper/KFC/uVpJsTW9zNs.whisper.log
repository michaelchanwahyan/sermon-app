[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   We're continuing our series on the book of Ezekiel.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.200]   And who's enjoyed the series so far?
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.300]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.800]   Okay, some of you haven't read it yet,
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.900]   so haven't enjoyed it yet.
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.000]   It's all good.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.200]   Today, the life, the topic is,
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.900]   is life a dead-end street?
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.500]   And Pastor John last week spoke on chapter five,
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.300]   and he spoke on three sort of main points.
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.100]   Don't rob God, don't rob others,
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.800]   don't rob yourself.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.100]   And he talked about these illusions of wealth, right?
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.500]   Illusions, things that aren't really true,
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.700]   aren't really there.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.300]   If you watch Spider-Man, Far From Home,
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.400]   there's a lot of illusions there, right?
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.800]   Wealth brings satisfaction, that's an illusion.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.300]   Wealth solves all problems.
[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.900]   Wealth brings peace of mind.
[00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.600]   Wealth brings security.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.100]   These were the different illusions
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.600]   that Pastor John talked about last week.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.300]   And the preacher continues in chapter six.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.600]   He talks about this problem
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.000]   that we have in this world.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.600]   And if you see the next slide,
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.700]   the problem a lot of us have
[00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.700]   is that we think the grass is greener on the other side,
[00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.700]   literally greener on the other side.
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.100]   You know, I'm from Canada,
[00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.600]   and I often have people that come up to me
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.500]   and say, "Oh, Canada, it's such a great place.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.700]   "I really want to go there.
[00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.600]   "You know, it's like the Promised Land,
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600]   "flowing with milk and honey."
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   And I'm like, "Yeah, Canada has its good and its bad,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.300]   "but Hong Kong also has its good and its bad.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.700]   "Is grass really greener in Canada?
[00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.300]   "Well, maybe not in winter.
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.100]   "You can't see the grass.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.100]   "It's probably very yellow, just like this, under the snow."
[00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.800]   The problem in this world right now that we have
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.100]   is that we think the grass is often greener on the other side.
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.100]   There's a question on the next slide, and it says this.
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.600]   "If only I had, then I would be happy."
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.100]   What's the first thing that comes up in your mind?
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.100]   For some of you, it might be sleep.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.100]   Condo? Yeah? Name it out. Name it out.
[00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.100]   If I only had, I would be--
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.100]   You would have happiness?
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.100]   You're not happy? Together? I'm joking.
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.100]   [laughs]
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.100]   Some people think, "Oh, if I only had, you know, this car," right?
[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.600]   A Ferrari or something like that.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.600]   "If I only had a house," it's hard to afford a house in Hong Kong.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   "If I only had, oh, this wife or a girlfriend or a family," right?
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.100]   Some people are very connected to that.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.100]   "If I only had, you know, children," right?
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.600]   "If I only had children, then I would be happy.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.100]   "Our marriage would be happy.
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.100]   "If I only had this job, if I had only this position,
[00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.600]   "then I would be happy."
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.100]   We all try to fill our hearts, as we see in the next slide.
[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.600]   We try to fill our hearts with things that often don't satisfy.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.100]   You know, I get that new phone, and it's nice for how long?
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.100]   A couple days, right? Two days.
[00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.100]   And then it's back to normal. It does the same sort of things.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.100]   You know, I see people who've wanted a relationship for so long,
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.100]   and then they finally get a relationship,
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.100]   and then they're like, you know,
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.100]   "God, can I get out of this relationship?"
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.600]   It happens.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   We buy something, we get into something
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.100]   that we think is greener on the other side,
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.100]   but at the end, it doesn't satisfy.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.100]   And that's sort of the problem we have in this world.
[00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.600]   It's sort of like a dead end at times, right?
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   It seems like no matter what we do,
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   we fill our life with stuff,
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   but it just doesn't satisfy.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   There's a disease. This disease is called discontentment.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.100]   Discontentment, according to the Internet,
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.100]   the definition is this,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:34.600]   the lack of satisfaction with one's possessions, status, or situation.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   Lack of satisfaction with one's possessions, status, or situation.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.100]   Is anybody feeling dissatisfied today? Discontent today?
[00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.100]   The definition of contentment is the opposite.
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.100]   Thankful to God who has given one's possessions, status, or situation.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.600]   You're thankful.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   We're going to play a game tonight.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.100]   It's called "Would You Rather?"
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.600]   Who's played it before? Would you rather?
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   Yeah? Good.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   For those who didn't put up their hand, we'll teach you how to play.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.100]   So number one, here's the situation here.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.100]   Be careful.
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.600]   So those who don't participate,
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   we'll invite you up to have a just dance afterwards,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.100]   just to keep you sharp tonight.
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.600]   So you notice those around you who don't participate,
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   at the end, you're going to have a just dance with Pastor John.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   Would you rather have wealth, possessions, and honor,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.100]   and not be able to enjoy it,
[00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.600]   or situation B, have very little wealth, possessions, and honor,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   and be able to enjoy it?
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.100]   So let's do it again.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.600]   Would you rather have wealth, possessions, and honor,
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.100]   and not be able to enjoy it, situation A,
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.100]   or situation B, have very little wealth, possessions, and honor,
[00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.100]   and be able to enjoy it?
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.100]   Okay. For those who want situation A, raise their hand.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.100]   Situation A.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.600]   You don't want a position?
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.100]   Possessions, wealth, and honor?
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.100]   You don't want those things?
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.100]   Are you sure? Are you sure?
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.100]   Think about it. Okay.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.100]   All right. Who wants situation B? Raise your hand.
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.100]   Okay. All right. Good.
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.100]   I'm noting those who haven't raised their hand.
[00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.100]   They're coming up for a just dance afterwards.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.100]   And the preacher says this, right?
[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.600]   He starts off, "There is an evil that I've seen under the sun,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.100]   and it lies heavy on mankind."
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.100]   What is this evil?
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.100]   What is this evil?
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.100]   Well, if we look at chapter 5,
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.100]   and we look at this chapter,
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.100]   last chapter, he's talking about, you know,
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.100]   God has given us all these things, right?
[00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.100]   But we can't seem to enjoy it, right?
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.100]   And so he's talking about discontentment, I believe.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.100]   This discontentment.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.100]   And he's saying that in this first situation,
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.100]   one person can have wealth, possessions, and honor, right?
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.100]   But it doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.100]   It doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.100]   Right? We look at the movie stars.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.100]   We think, "Wow, they have wealth.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.100]   They have possessions.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.100]   They have fame. They have sort of honor."
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.100]   Right? But shouldn't they be content?
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.100]   Or we look at, you know, some rich people in our lives,
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.100]   and we think, "Wow, if only we had what they had,
[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.100]   we would be content."
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.100]   But the preacher is saying here,
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.100]   God gives this person wealth, possessions, and honor
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.100]   so that he lacks nothing at all that he desires.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.100]   Yet God does not give him power to enjoy them.
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.100]   But a stranger enjoys them.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.100]   This is vanity. It is a grievous sin.
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.100]   Has anybody been to Mississauga before?
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.100]   It's in Toronto. Yeah? Mississauga?
[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.100]   There's this road. It's called Mississauga Road.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.100]   All right? It's where all the most beautiful, big houses are.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.100]   It's like sort of Beverly Hills, you know?
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.100]   Like all the huge houses. Right?
[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.100]   And whenever I drive past there, I see this one house,
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.100]   and it just stands out.
[00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.100]   And I see this house, and I'm like, "Wow.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.100]   If only I lived in this house."
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:37.100]   You know? Then, wow, my dreams would be fulfilled.
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.100]   And it's interesting, because my parents got to know this person.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.100]   Somehow, he came to the church one day.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.100]   Chinese, yes. It was important to you, right, Charles?
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:53.100]   He's Chinese. He was Chinese.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:09:00.100]   And he came to our church, and one day, he was on the news.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.100]   And he was back in Hong Kong. He was driving a Ferrari.
[00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:09.100]   And he was with his brother, and he crashed the car.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.100]   And he died instantly.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.100]   And I was like, "Wow. This person.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.100]   He owned the house that I always dreamed of.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.100]   He drove the car that I've always wanted."
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.100]   And unfortunately, God took him away.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.100]   Wow.
[00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.100]   Wealth, possessions, honor.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.100]   But it doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.100]   It doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:45.100]   This man left several kids and a wife behind.
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:52.100]   It's sad. It's sad to think that the wealth of this world doesn't mean contentment.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:56.100]   Or yet, you're able to enjoy them.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.100]   Second "would you rather" question.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.100]   All right.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:05.100]   Would you rather have a hundred children?
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.100]   Does anybody have a hundred children here?
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:16.100]   A hundred children while your soul is not satisfied and no one goes to your funeral?
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:22.100]   Okay. Would you rather have a hundred children and your soul is not satisfied and no one goes to your funeral?
[00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:29.100]   Or would you have no children while your soul is satisfied and some people attend your funeral?
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.100]   Okay. Who would rather have situation A? Raise your hand.
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.100]   Situation A. A hundred children.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.100]   Come on.
[00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.100]   So many children. Wow.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:48.100]   A hundred children. Nobody? Going once. Going twice. I'm joking. It's not a...
[00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:51.100]   Okay. Who would have situation B? Raise your hand.
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.100]   Okay. All right. Very good.
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.100]   The second situation that the preacher talks about is this.
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:12.100]   A hundred children and lives many years but yet his soul is not satisfied and no one goes to his burial.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.100]   What does it mean back in the day when you had a lot of children?
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.100]   Well, a lot of them, what did they do back then in Israel?
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.100]   They were farmers or taking care of the livestock. Right?
[00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:28.100]   So, if you had many children, it means you could have many helpers. Right?
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:33.100]   You wanted people to help, you know, with the business, with the farm, with the livestock.
[00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.100]   It meant that you probably could be richer. Right?
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:44.100]   If you took care of the livestock better or you took care of the farm better, it meant you could have been richer.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.100]   Also, it meant you had descendants. Right?
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.100]   Descendants was very important to have a name that could carry on. Right?
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.100]   David and his lineage. Right?
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:01.100]   God promised that your lineage would pass on. That was a very important thing.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:09.100]   Also, if you had many children, it could have meant that you would have been taken care of. Right?
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.100]   My dad always asks me. Right?
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.100]   Oh, he didn't always ask me. He just asked me before.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:21.100]   He's like, "When you get older, will you take care of me?"
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.100]   Has anybody's parents ever asked them this? Yeah?
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.100]   Oh, yeah. Somebody. I'm not the only person.
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.100]   So, I like to play with my dad. Right?
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.100]   So, I'm like, "Let me think about it."
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.100]   You know, I was 10 at the time.
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:41.100]   Actually, what I said is, "I'll only take care of mom."
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.100]   Just to bug him. Just to bug him.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.100]   I'm joking, dad. I'm joking.
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:50.100]   I'll take care of you.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.100]   And it's sad. Right?
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:57.100]   It's sad that when, you know, some of these old people.
[00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:02.100]   We went to do elderly visitation.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.100]   All right?
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.100]   This is before COVID.
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:12.100]   We went regularly as a fellowship to visit some of the elderlies in our city.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.100]   And we visited some of them, and they were doing great.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:22.100]   You know, their sons or their daughter and their relatives or their grandchildren would come and visit regularly.
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:28.100]   There would also be some that we encountered that were very lonely.
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.100]   And I remember this vividly.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.100]   This one elderly gentleman who lived by himself.
[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.100]   And I asked him where his kids were.
[00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.100]   Did he have any family? Any kids?
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.100]   And he's like, "Yes. I have kids. I have two children.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.100]   And they live in Australia."
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.100]   I'm like, "Oh, that's great. You have children in Australia."
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.100]   And I'm like, "When's the last time you've seen them?"
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:56.100]   And he said, "I don't remember. It must have been several years already."
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.100]   And I was like, "Oh, it must be very busy.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.100]   Maybe they just, you know, have work and children and they don't have time.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.100]   Maybe they call you. Have they called you?"
[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.100]   And he's like, "No. He doesn't really call often either."
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:18.100]   It's sad to have children, 100 children, and no one attends your burial.
[00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:24.100]   And nobody takes care of you when you get older.
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:31.100]   And the preacher says in this situation, it's better to have a stillborn baby,
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:38.100]   a stillborn baby, than to be one of these people.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.100]   It's because he says this, right?
[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.100]   "For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness.
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:46.100]   And in darkness, the name is covered.
[00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.100]   Moreover, it has not seen the sun or known anything.
[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:55.100]   Yet it finds rest rather than he."
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:15:02.100]   Better a stillborn child than a person who has 100 children
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:06.100]   and nobody attends his funeral.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:11.100]   So, children doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:16.100]   Children doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.100]   The last thing, the last point he mentions,
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.100]   okay, let's do the next "Would you rather" game.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:29.100]   Would you rather live 2,000 years, okay, 2,000 years,
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.100]   that's a very long time, okay?
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.100]   Think of all the investments you could make in 2,000 years.
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:44.100]   And enjoy no good, or you live a short life and enjoy some good, okay?
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:49.100]   Who would rather have situation A, raise their hand, live 2,000 years?
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.100]   Anybody want to live 2,000 years?
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.100]   2,000 years? No? Okay.
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.100]   Who would rather have situation B, raise their hand.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:04.100]   Situation B, okay, all right, situation B.
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.100]   This is the last point he's trying to make.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:13.100]   Even though he should live 1,000 years twice, over,
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:19.100]   yet enjoy no good, do not all go to the same place.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:25.100]   Does anybody know who the oldest living person is right now?
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.100]   According to Wikipedia.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:31.100]   I just Googled this a couple of days ago.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.100]   150, okay, it's not. Let's show the next slide.
[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:41.100]   The oldest living woman currently, according to Wikipedia in the green here,
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:45.100]   is 118 years old.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.100]   118 years old, okay? Wow, that's great.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:57.100]   Okay, Lucie, is it Lucie? Lucille, Lucille from France.
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:03.100]   Do you think the oldest person in the world is a living woman or a man right now?
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.100]   Do you think? Any guesses?
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.100]   Woman, okay.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:09.100]   Next slide, you guys are right, you guys are smart.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:14.100]   The oldest living man right now is 113 years old.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:20.100]   It's Juan, right? Juan, okay, from Venezuela.
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:26.100]   Wow, who wants to live to 118 years old?
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.100]   Raise their hand. Anybody want to? No? Why not?
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.100]   John does, okay, okay, JP, good.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.100]   All right, you guys don't want to live that old, all right, understandable.
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:45.100]   Who is the oldest person in the Bible, oldest living person in the Bible?
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.100]   Not Abraham. Who?
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.100]   Starts with an M.
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:56.100]   Yes, I heard it, I heard it. Say it out loud.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.100]   Yes, not Adam. Methuselah, Methuselah.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:05.100]   How old was he? 969 years old.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:11.100]   969 years old, wow, amazing.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.100]   The preacher is saying this.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.100]   What's so good about living so long?
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:23.100]   1,000 years, twice over, 2,000 years, what's so good about it?
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:27.100]   What's so good about it when, as we see in the next slide,
[00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:34.100]   both old and young people go to the same place?
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.100]   They all go to the same place, right?
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.100]   They eventually face death.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:50.100]   And what he's saying is long life doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.100]   In chapter 6, he says this, right?
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:57.100]   Wealth, possessions, honor doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.100]   Children doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:05.100]   Living a long life doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.100]   It doesn't guarantee contentment.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:13.100]   Let's continue in verse 7 to 9, verse 7 to 9 here.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.100]   And he says this, "All the toil of man is for his mouth,
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.100]   yet his appetite is not satisfied.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:23.100]   For what advantage has the wise over the fool,
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:32.100]   and what does the poor know how to conduct himself over before the living?"
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:38.100]   The preacher is summarizing the problem in these couple of verses.
[00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.100]   He's saying that we are just never satisfied.
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:45.100]   We keep eating this appetite, right?
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:50.100]   The burger just gets longer and taller and bigger, right?
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:53.100]   But we're just never satisfied, right?
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:58.100]   How good would it be to pay for somebody's meal
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:04.100]   and know that they would be satisfied for the rest of their life, right?
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:08.100]   I keep eating buffets and just keep never getting satisfied.
[00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.100]   I keep eating and eating, eating and eating.
[00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:18.100]   We have this desire within us and it just never gets satisfied, right?
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.100]   Have you ever thought about that?
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.100]   You might be thinking about your next meal.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.100]   But have you thought about the next meal after that
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.100]   and the meal after that and the meal after that?
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.100]   Because it keeps going.
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.100]   We're never satisfied.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.100]   And that's what the preacher is saying,
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.100]   that all the work that we have is for our mouth,
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:43.100]   and yet we are never satisfied.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.100]   This is the problem.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:49.100]   And he says this problem is all over, right?
[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.100]   You could be wise.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.100]   You could be a fool, right?
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.100]   You could be rich.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.100]   You could be poor.
[00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.100]   Both of these two kinds of people,
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.100]   they all have this unquenchable satisfaction,
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.100]   unquenchable desire that cannot be satisfied.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.100]   We're just not satisfied.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:15.100]   The ultimate problem is this desire that we have
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:22.100]   that just never seems to be satisfied.
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.100]   And so the preacher highlights the problem.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.100]   He specifies three specific situations
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.100]   that we can't find contentment or satisfaction.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.100]   And then he finishes off this chapter.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.100]   And he says this.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.100]   Let's read it together, all right?
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:44.100]   "Whatever has come to be has already been named,
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.100]   and it has known what man is,
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.100]   and that he is not able to dispute with one stronger than he.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.100]   The one"--words--
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.100]   "the more vanity.
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.100]   And what is advantage to man?
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.100]   For who knows what is good for man while he lives
[00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.100]   the few days of his vain life,
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.100]   which he passes like a shadow?
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:13.100]   For who can tell man what will come after him under the sun?
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.100]   The first thing that he talks about is
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:25.100]   whatever has come to be has already been named."
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:33.100]   The first thing that the preacher is specifying here
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:38.100]   is that there's somebody that already knows what's going to happen.
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.100]   He calls us to contentment.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:44.100]   And the first thing he mentions to us
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.100]   is that God is in control.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.100]   He is sovereign.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.100]   He already knows what is going to be named.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.100]   Before Google had a name,
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.100]   before Microsoft had a name,
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.100]   before Apple had a name,
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.100]   God already knew these things were going to be named.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.100]   He is in control.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.100]   He's all-knowing.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.100]   He is sovereign.
[00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:13.100]   The second thing he points out is that God is stronger, right?
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.100]   It is known what man is
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:20.100]   and that he is not able to dispute with one that is stronger than he.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.100]   In other words, God is wiser.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.100]   God is stronger and wiser than us.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:34.100]   The third thing that the preacher points out is this, right?
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.100]   "For who knows what is good for man while he lives
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   the few days of his life?"
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.100]   The third thing that the preacher points out is this,
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.100]   that God knows what is best for us.
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.100]   God knows what is best for us.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:57.100]   And so he is calling us to contentment.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.100]   And so according to these verses,
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:03.100]   what is truly contentment?
[00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.100]   I'll give the definition here.
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:11.100]   Contentment is confidence that God is sovereign over all things,
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:15.100]   that he is much wiser than us,
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:21.100]   and believing that he has what is best for us.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.100]   Contentment is confidence that God is sovereign over all things,
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.100]   that he is much wiser than us,
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:37.100]   and trusting that he has what is best for us.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.100]   Apostle Paul says this,
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.100]   "Not that I am speaking of being in need,
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:48.100]   for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content.
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:56.100]   I know how to be brought low, and I know how to be abound."
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:01.100]   And that's 'cause Paul was rich.
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.100]   Before he was rich, right, he was one of the Pharisees.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.100]   He went to the top schools.
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:11.100]   He knows what it means to have a high position.
[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:17.100]   But he was also a fool, because he did not know God.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:22.100]   He didn't know truly Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.100]   And he was also poor, right?
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:33.100]   And he was also funded by the churches as a tent maker in his ministry.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.100]   And so Paul has been rich.
[00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.100]   He has been poor.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.100]   He has been wise.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:41.100]   He has been a fool.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.100]   And yet he's saying here in this situation,
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:50.100]   he has learned to be content in whatever situation.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.100]   And he's talking to the Philippian church here.
[00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:58.100]   He's talking about, you know, the suffering he's enduring for the gospel.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   He's talking about the churches he's built up,
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:04.100]   the opposition that he's faced.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:14.100]   And yet, God strengthens him through all things.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:17.100]   Pascal says this,
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:22.100]   "There is a God-shaped vacuum in the heart of every person,
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.100]   and it can never be filled by any created thing.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:34.100]   It can only be filled by God, made known through Jesus Christ."
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.100]   Put your hand on your heart right now.
[00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.100]   Put your hand on your heart.
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.100]   Know this, right?
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.100]   This is what Pascal is saying.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:54.100]   Your heart cannot be filled by LV or Gucci or Ferrari or another condo.
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:27:02.100]   It can only be filled by the Creator himself.
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:07.100]   Not any created thing, only the Creator himself,
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:12.100]   made known through Jesus Christ.
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:16.100]   So you ask, you know, Pastor John, Johnny, or John as well,
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.100]   you can ask Pastor John,
[00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:24.100]   "Is life a dead end? Is life a dead end street?"
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:28.100]   The preacher is challenging us here today
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:34.100]   that life ends, or life actually begins.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:44.100]   Life begins when we die to our own desires, our selfish desires.
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:50.100]   Life begins when we die to our own desires.
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.100]   What did Jesus say?
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:28:03.100]   If we are to follow him, we must deny ourselves.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:08.100]   Pick up the cross and follow him.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.100]   And what is eternal life?
[00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:14.100]   Eternal life is knowing Jesus Christ.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.100]   Life truly begins when we die to ourselves,
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:24.100]   when we deny ourselves our own selfishness, our own sin.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.100]   Life truly begins.
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.100]   Life truly begins.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.100]   The preacher is challenging us
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:37.100]   that we can't find contentment in this world.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.100]   Many children, wealth, long years of life,
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:44.100]   we can't find contentment in this world.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.100]   It's only through the Creator that can satisfy
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.100]   this deep longings in our heart.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:29:00.100]   Only the Creator can satisfy the deepest longings of our heart.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:05.100]   And that is why it's so hard to be a Christian in this world.
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.100]   Why is it so hard?
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   Because we're living in this world,
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:16.100]   full of its temptations, its different desires,
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.100]   people you can compare with.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.100]   We're supposed to be living in this world,
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:25.100]   and we're so trapped with the temptations and the sins of this world,
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.100]   but we're not supposed to be of this world.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.100]   Our destination is heaven.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.100]   Our destination is heaven.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.100]   We're supposed to live among these people,
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.100]   climbing the corporate ladder,
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.100]   making money, just like the people around us,
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.100]   exercising, having fun,
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.100]   but we're not of this world.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:57.100]   Money, how good we are at sports,
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.100]   is not supposed to define us.
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:04.100]   Our identity is in heaven.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.100]   Our passport is in heaven.
[00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.100]   It's not about a passport in Hong Kong,
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:14.100]   or if you get it in UK, or if you get it in Canada.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   Our citizenship has to be from heaven.
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.100]   And so you ask Pastor Johnny,
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.100]   "I want to be content.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.100]   How can I do it?"
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.100]   Practically, every day, in this world, day to day,
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:33.100]   how can I do it?
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.100]   I have three points for you.
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:37.100]   Three points.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.100]   And the first thing is what the preacher talked about.
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.100]   Give up control.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.100]   Give up control.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.100]   Right?
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.100]   We need to trust that God is sovereign,
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.100]   that He is in control.
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:51.100]   He's wiser than us,
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.100]   and that He has what is best for us.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.100]   The first thing is we have to give up control.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.100]   Right?
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.100]   There are many things in this world that we can't control.
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   The only thing that we can control is what we do,
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.100]   our attitude, and what we do, and our actions.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.100]   Right?
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.100]   So the first thing that we need to do is give up control.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:19.100]   Give up control, not to just to anyone, but to who?
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.100]   To the one that is sovereign, wiser,
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.100]   and knows what is best for us.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:30.100]   Jeremiah 29, 11, Pastor John prayed it.
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.100]   "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:37.100]   "Plans to prosper you and not to harm you.
[00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.100]   Plans to give you hope and a future."
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:47.100]   God was saying this to the Israel people.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.100]   They were in suffering, in exile,
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.100]   for more than 300 years, right?
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.100]   Or 300 years.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.100]   Do I still have a future?
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:00.100]   Will I still prosper?
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.100]   God was giving them.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:06.100]   God was giving them this promise.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:10.100]   And He is also speaking to us today.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:15.100]   God wants us to have a future and a hope.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.100]   It might not be, you know, being super rich.
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:23.100]   It might not be everything that you wish you could have.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:26.100]   But God will give you enough.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:29.100]   He is enough.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.100]   Give up control.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.100]   Give control to the Lord.
[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.100]   What do you think the second thing is?
[00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.100]   Don't show it yet.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.100]   What do you think the--
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.100]   Give what?
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.100]   What's the second thing?
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.100]   Any ideas?
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.100]   Give?
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.100]   Give thanks.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.100]   We got to give thanks.
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:49.100]   1 Thessalonians, it says this,
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.100]   "Rejoice always, pray without ceasing,
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:56.100]   give thanks in all circumstances.
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:03.100]   For this is the will of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.100]   Give thanks.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.100]   I remember a couple times in my life,
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.100]   I was very unhappy.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.100]   I don't know what happened.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.100]   I was--
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:11.100]   I don't know, somebody--
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.100]   Maybe I lost in a basketball game or something.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.100]   It doesn't happen often, but it might have happened.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.100]   And I just remember, you know, I feel so frustrated.
[00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.100]   I missed that shot.
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:26.100]   You know, I didn't guard this person right, you know, in defense.
[00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:27.100]   I was just so frustrated.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:30.100]   I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to play basketball again
[00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:34.100]   for another week," or something like that.
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:39.100]   And I just remember, like, remind myself, give thanks.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.100]   Have you ever tried giving thanks
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:45.100]   when you're in a very unhappy situation?
[00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.100]   What happens?
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:51.100]   Has anybody tried giving thanks when they're not happy, sad?
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.100]   Has anybody tried it?
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.100]   Yes?
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.100]   What happens when you do it?
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.100]   You feel better.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.100]   You're at peace.
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.100]   Very good.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.100]   You guys should try it.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:05.100]   The next time you're unhappy, or maybe you're unhappy now,
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:06.100]   you should try it.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.100]   Give thanks.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.100]   "Oh, God, thank you.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.100]   You know, I still have breath.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:10.100]   Thank you, God.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.100]   You know, I still have my children, my family.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:13.100]   I have people who love me.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.100]   I have this church, and I have all these pastors
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:17.100]   that take care of me."
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:21.100]   You know, start to give thanks.
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:26.100]   And when you give thanks, you start to be content,
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.100]   thankful for the things God has given you.
[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:34.100]   The last give is give away.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:38.100]   Give control to God, give thanks to God,
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:44.100]   and you give away to God and to others.
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:50.100]   God spoke to Abraham, or Abram back then, and he said this.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.100]   Next slide.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.100]   "I will make you into a great nation.
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.100]   I will bless you.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:03.100]   I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing."
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.100]   Why did God want to bless Abraham?
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.100]   Why did God want to bless Israel?
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:17.100]   So that they could be a blessing to others.
[00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.100]   God didn't want to bless Abraham so he could be super rich,
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:25.100]   take control of the whole world, and that would be that.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:30.100]   He wanted to bless Abraham and Israel so that they could be
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.100]   a blessing to others.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:37.100]   A blessing to others.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:40.100]   Now I know the Israel team has been to the next slide,
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.100]   the Dead Sea.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:45.100]   Why is the Dead Sea called the Dead Sea?
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.100]   What has happened?
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.100]   What has happened?
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:51.100]   Pastor John, what has happened?
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.100]   Water, salt water keeps coming in, right?
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.100]   But then what happens?
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.100]   It just stays there.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:05.100]   Eventually the sun evaporates it and it becomes very, very salty.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.100]   The water evaporates and it becomes very salty.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.100]   It doesn't flow.
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.100]   It doesn't flow.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:22.100]   And that's what happens when we keep God's blessing for ourselves.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:29.100]   That's what happens when we keep God's blessing for ourselves.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:34.100]   Eventually we become like the Dead Sea.
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.100]   We get stuffed up.
[00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.100]   We spend everything.
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.100]   It all becomes about us.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:45.100]   When we keep God's blessing, when God has blessed you with
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.100]   knowledge, God has blessed you with money, God has blessed you
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:56.100]   with resources or connections, when you keep it to yourself,
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:00.100]   eventually it just all becomes about you.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:06.100]   And when it becomes all about you, eventually you fall into sin.
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:11.100]   You fall into the Dead Sea, literally.
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.100]   God blesses you with money.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.100]   God blesses you with connections.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.100]   God blesses you with musical talent.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:30.100]   God blesses you with connections so that you can bless others.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.100]   So that you can be a blessing to those around you.
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:37.100]   That's right.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:44.100]   God is calling us to contentment in a very discontented world.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:52.100]   The preacher is calling us to be content in this very discontent world.
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:58.100]   Are you willing to give control to the Lord?
[00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.100]   Acknowledge that He is in control.
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.100]   He is sovereign.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.100]   He is wiser than you.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:10.100]   And that He has what is best for you.
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:14.100]   Some of the most unhappy people are people that think they need to
[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.100]   control everything.
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:22.100]   Are we willing to give up that control for surrender to the Lord?
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:26.100]   Are you willing to give thanks?
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:31.100]   Paul told the church, give thanks continuously.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:35.100]   Every day we need to pray and give thanks to the Lord for what He has
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.100]   given us.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:42.100]   If you give up control to the Lord, if you give thanks to the Lord,
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:46.100]   and you give away to the Lord and give away to the people that God wants
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:48.100]   you to give it away to.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.100]   The things, the possessions, the knowledge, the connections, the
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:53.100]   things that God has blessed you with.
[00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.100]   If you give it away.
[00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.100]   God has called us not to be hoarders.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:05.100]   God has called us to be stewards.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.100]   Stewards don't own anything.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.100]   Stewards are only caretakers.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.100]   We only take care of the money that God has given us.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:20.100]   We only take care of the children that God has given us.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:23.100]   We are not hoarders.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.100]   God has called us to be stewards.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.100]   Are you in control?
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.100]   Are you going to take control?
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.100]   Or are you going to surrender?
[00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.100]   Are you going to give thanks?
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.100]   Or are you going to complain?
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.100]   Are you going to give away?
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.100]   Or are you going to hoard it for yourself?
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:53.100]   That is what the preacher is challenging us today.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:58.100]   As the band comes up and we are going to sing the song,
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:05.100]   God, I look to you.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.100]   Goodness of God.
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:12.100]   Let's take a moment right now to reflect on our heart and come
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.100]   before the Lord.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:17.100]   And even in repentance.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:22.100]   God, have I surrendered control to you?
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:30.100]   Or am I full of myself and I want to control things?
[00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.100]   God, am I thankful?
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.100]   Or am I complaining?
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:43.100]   God, am I giving away?
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:47.100]   Or am I hoarding for myself?
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:53.100]   Let's reflect on ourselves and our heart.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:57.100]   And just confess these things before the Lord.
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.100]   Let's take a moment.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:01.100]   [MUSIC]
