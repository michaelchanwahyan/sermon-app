00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
 Recently I listened to a TED talk, it was called "Everything we know about addiction

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,520
 is wrong". I don't know if you've ever watched it. It's got about 10 million views

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,440
 on YouTube and it's a great TED talk, I do encourage you to go and watch it. But there's

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,360
 one bit that really caught my eye, this guy was talking about how he grew up in a family

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,640
 of addicts and he realised that we've been dealing with addiction wrong. He talks about

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,480
 this professor who was studying addiction, who did this experiment several decades ago

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,840
 now where he put two rats in a cage and gave them two drinks bottles, one with water and

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,000
 one with water laced with heroin, to experiment what the responses would be, whether actually

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,080
 drug addiction is really down to chemical hooks onto us. So what happens to this rat?

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,760
 Very quickly it finds out that one bottle tastes better than the other, makes it feel

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,120
 better than the other and very quickly that rat passes away. Then he tries again and the

12
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,060
 same thing happens again. But then he was like "Oh, but maybe this experiment isn't

13
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,040
 truly fair because the rat only is in an empty cage with just two bottles, what else is he

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,760
 going to do?" So then he creates another cage, a bigger one, but this time he calls

15
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,200
 it rat park and it's bigger and there's cheese and there's snacks and there's

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,880
 swings and most importantly there were other rats there as well. And do you know what he

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,520
 found happened? The rats would go to take this other bottle of water but only every

18
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,760
 now and again. What was before, which was 100% overdose rate and death rate, ended up

19
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,520
 being 0% overdose. 0% overdose. They would go every now and again, some for a little

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,240
 bit, some would completely ignore it, but this problem was completely removed. And his

21
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:03,560
 point was that actually the solution to addiction is not sobriety, it's not being cold turkey,

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,600
 it's connection. And then he goes on to talk, he says "All of us, rats or humans,

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,160
 animals, created beings, I think Anthony just shared this in the Mighty Oaks Foundation,

24
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,600
 all of us are built for relationship, it's not just elderly people. We all have this

25
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:27,640
 inbuilt thing from the moment that we are born for communion, to be connected with one

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,200
 another. We all have it, whether you're an introvert or extrovert, you have it. You

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:38,280
 have this deep, deep, deep desire to be in bond, in a bond, in a relationship with someone.

28
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,800
 And this whole issue of addiction really made me think about Hong Kong. Hong Kong has tons

29
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,160
 of problems. We have problems with the high cost of living, we have problems with the

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,440
 small space of living, we have the problems of the political tension, we have the problems

31
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:57,000
 of the pandemic anxiety. But the biggest, biggest problem of all is this lack of connection.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,040
 Why do we have those issues with money, sex and power? Because there's a deep need for

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,760
 connection that isn't being filled. And when you don't have that deep need for connection

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,520
 satisfied, you will find anything that you can to give you relief, just like that rat

35
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,400
 in the empty cage did. But when you have connection, that's when your problems go away. And then

36
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,240
 it made me think, okay, so what about the church? How do we respond to this issue of

37
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,280
 disconnection? How good are we at being in communion? And I'll tell you, I don't know

38
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,560
 if the church has passed COVID with flying colours at all. I don't know if we've passed.

39
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:39,760
 Because we've struggled with connection, right? We have struggled in staying together. I can't

40
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,640
 tell you how many times I've heard people now, I'm preaching to the choir here, everyone's

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,440
 here, people on YouTube, I love you, I hope that you are doing well. I'm sure there's

42
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,760
 a reason why you're not able to join us now, but I pray that as soon as you are able to

43
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,200
 come back, please come back and join us. Because we have this thing now where it's like, oh,

44
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,960
 I can get my Saturday night back, I can get my Sunday morning back, I can just go on YouTube,

45
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,920
 I can just watch the sermon online, and it's good enough. And I'll tell you, I'll be frank,

46
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,240
 when someone tells me that, I'll be frank, I'm not good enough for you to be tuning in

47
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,560
 on YouTube, you might as well go and tune in on Netflix instead. And it's funny, one

48
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,040
 of the famous speakers in the world, Timothy Keller, his mentor is a minister from England

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,080
 called Martin Lloyd-Jones. And he ministered at a time where they were starting to get

50
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,120
 technology, they were starting to record sermons. And he was a very kind of like confident man

51
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,080
 in an age that I think it would have been very interesting to watch him live in this

52
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,520
 era. And he said, "Why would anyone want to hear the Word of God on their own? Why would

53
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,440
 anyone want to have the Word of God open to them away from the body? Because if you do

54
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,960
 it on your own, that's just information intake. But when you do it together, that's a communal

55
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,000
 experience. That's when you get to live it out." And I think this is where we really

56
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,440
 struggle as a church, because we don't do that. We've started to think that we can do

57
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,240
 church on our own. We started to think that church is a building that we go to, and that

58
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,640
 we can just tune in online to different things. But the problem is that's not enough, because

59
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:18,640
 your deep, deep need for communion, for connection still exists, right? We live in the most connected

60
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:25,560
 age in the history of mankind, yet we are also the loneliest era generation in mankind.

61
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,640
 Why is that? And what is the church not doing? Or really, rather, what should the church

62
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,040
 be doing? And here's my thing. If you want to live a godly life, you can't do it on your

63
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,920
 own. That's it. If you want to take something away from this sermon tonight, if you want

64
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,400
 to live a godly life, if you want to be a godly person, you cannot do it on your own.

65
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,240
 That is not how it works. God puts that in the commandment, "You must love me and love

66
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,360
 people. It is buy one, get one, throw it free." And you have to have it. You can't keep that

67
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,400
 on away. It has to come together. And so today we're talking about this issue, this topic

68
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:05,560
 of communion, and we look at the Passo di Gennac and the people are devoted to fellowship.

69
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,880
 The word there is "cannonia." Yeah, we can go, "Cannonia" there. I can do it from here,

70
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,280
 I think. There we go. The word is "cannonia," fellowship. This isn't club. This isn't the

71
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,800
 Aberdeen Marina Club. This isn't any kind of society that you're joining. When it's

72
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,880
 talking about fellowship, it's talking about deep partnership, it's talking about sharing,

73
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,800
 it's talking about having this profound regard for one another. And John's talked about this

74
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,760
 where when they got together, they were as one. They weren't just in the same room. They

75
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:41,080
 had the same spirit. They had the same heart. And then Paul in the Bible talks about, in

76
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,120
 1 Corinthians 12, in Ephesians 4, talking about us being a body. That we are hands,

77
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,560
 we are feet, we are arms. We are stuck together. How weird would it be if you walked on the

78
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,920
 sidewalk over there and then you saw just one arm just lying around, flailing around?

79
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,000
 It would look weird. It would look a little bit odd. And then because it's Hong Kong,

80
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,040
 you just carry on walking. But that's not what we were created for. We're supposed to

81
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:13,480
 be together. And I think you know that. The question is, why don't we do it? And the question

82
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,360
 is, when we do get together, what should we do? This evening, well done to all of you.

83
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,600
 You have ticked off your box, off your checklist for this week, been to church. But is that

84
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,320
 it? Why did God tell us to gather? Why did God tell us to be in this place together as

85
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,080
 one? What was the purpose of it? And there's really two passages of scripture that I've

86
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,880
 heard and it has always been on my mind when it comes to this topic of community, coming

87
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:42,640
 to this topic of going to church, gathering together. And the first one, or the main one

88
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,680
 is the one that we've been focusing on these last few weeks. And we'll go back to that

89
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,480
 at the end. But the main one, the other one that I hear about a lot that I see is from

90
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,640
 Hebrews. And it's this, Hebrews chapter 10, verse 24 to 25. "And let us consider how to

91
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,800
 stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together as is the

92
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,400
 habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the day drawing

93
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,320
 near." So when you ask, why do I bother going to church? Mom, why do you tell me that I

94
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:16,520
 have to go to church? Is it really just to sit there to just listen to some guy talk

95
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:26,220
 for anywhere between 20 minutes to an hour? You're like, what, an hour? John shared this

96
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,520
 article with a couple of his staff a couple of months ago and he says, people go to church

97
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,280
 for different reasons. Some go for the preaching, some go for the worship, some go for the food,

98
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,300
 some go for the ladies, some go for all these different reasons. But why do they stay at

99
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,680
 church? Friends. That's why they stay. However good your preaching is, it won't keep people

100
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,480
 unless they are in community, unless they are in connection with one another. So that's

101
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,760
 the reason why we stay in church. What do we do in church? This is the question you

102
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,280
 should ask. Now that you've stepped through the doors to be here, the question you should

103
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,880
 ask is, when you leave here, you should ask, was I the church? Did I do what I was supposed

104
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,400
 to do when I was coming here? What is the purpose of this gathering? And this is what

105
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,840
 I think it is. Let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works. To

106
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,180
 come to church is not just to hear the word, but that's very, very important. It's not

107
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,360
 just to worship God, because that's very important. It's not just to pray to God together, because

108
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,800
 that's also very important, but it's to stir each other up in love and good works. It's

109
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,440
 to consider how to do that. Now, before we even go into what love and good works are,

110
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,480
 let's start with the word consider. When we gather together, what we're supposed to do

111
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,520
 is we're supposed to look to the person, to the left and to the right of us, and consider

112
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:48,520
 and think about how we can encourage that person. Now, before you can even consider

113
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:54,200
 how to do it, you need to know that person. You need to know what gets them going. You

114
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,600
 need to know what they need. You need to know how they can be encouraged. And this is the

115
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,800
 really, the point that I first want to make is, if we really are the church, we must know

116
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,160
 each other. And there's only really one way to know each other, to talk to each other,

117
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,720
 to ask each other questions. I've been in Hong Kong for three and a half years, and

118
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,200
 in the roles that I have, I get to meet so many people around the city, it gets my head

119
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,200
 spinning. But you know what I've found in these last few years, which is completely

120
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,640
 different from the life that I grew up in in England, where there's just not that many

121
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,040
 people to get to know, is that people in Hong Kong, I feel, I fear, have more acquaintances

122
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,400
 than they do friends. Now, they may say, "Oh, he's my friend, he's my friend, he's my Facebook

123
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:45,920
 friend, someone here, someone like here has 5,000 Facebook friends." But I think we have

124
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,000
 more acquaintances than friends. Because as I intentionally spend more time with these

125
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,800
 people, with people that I've been introduced to by other friends, I feel like, "Oh, actually,

126
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,440
 you guys don't even know each other that well. You've known each other for 20 years, and

127
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,600
 yet you've actually never asked each other about anything." That's of real importance.

128
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,200
 So that's my first question to you. If we were to balance your acquaintances and your

129
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:18,360
 friends, where are you at? The famous theologian Vin Diesel said, "I don't got friends, I got

130
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:26,680
 family." Do you have more acquaintances, or do you have more friends? Do you have people

131
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,120
 who truly know you, and do you really know them? Because this is another thing, you don't

132
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,320
 really know yourself apart from without other people around. In fact, it's other people

133
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,600
 being next to you that helps you learn a bit about yourself. And when you meet someone

134
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,120
 else, you actually get to know a little bit more about them. I thank the Lord for Sandra.

135
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,360
 Because if I didn't get to meet Sandra, and it was only John that I knew, only John that

136
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:02,440
 I met, I would be terrified and I would be very concerned. But once I met Sandra, I was

137
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:11,640
 like, "Ah, this makes sense. That's how this works." When you meet someone else, let's

138
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,400
 say you know this friend, let's say I know John, it's only when I meet his wife or his

139
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,160
 children or his grandchildren, then I start to see other aspects of him that I would have

140
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:24,520
 never been able to know. Tim Keller talks about this, and he's quoting another mentor

141
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,840
 of his, who's C.S. Lewis, and he writes, and I wanted to share this quote with you because

142
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,080
 I think it's great. C.S. Lewis argues that it takes a community of people to get to know

143
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,620
 an individual person. Reflecting on his own friendships, he observed that some aspects

144
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,400
 of one of his friends' personality were brought out only through interaction with a second

145
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,640
 friend. That meant if he lost the second friend, he lost the part of his first friend that

146
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,760
 was otherwise invisible. By myself, I'm not large enough to call the whole man into activity.

147
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,160
 I want other lights than my own to show all his facets. If it takes a community to know

148
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,200
 an ordinary human being, how much more necessary would it be to get to know Jesus alongside

149
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,280
 others? By praying with friends, you will be able to hear and see facets of Jesus that

150
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,720
 you have not yet perceived. You can't love God properly if you don't love people. You

151
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:15,320
 can't know God properly unless you have other people around you. You don't know me at all,

152
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,320
 almost, just by listening to me preach every now and again. But when you spend time with

153
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,240
 me, when you spend time with Christina, then you'll be like, "Oh, now that makes sense

154
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,000
 as well." When you meet my mum, then you'll be like, "Oh, so that's where he gets outside

155
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,320
 from." When you meet my brother, you'll be like, "Now I know why James is so strong.

156
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:47,960
 He's been carrying his brother all his life." And you realise it's only when you meet the

157
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,440
 other people that you're like, "Ah, I get to see a part of you that I've never seen

158
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,360
 before." Isn't that beautiful? Isn't that what we're supposed to do? As a community,

159
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,740
 that is what we're supposed to do. So my question for us is this, do we know each other? Now,

160
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,120
 we had the pleasure two weeks ago where we went to eat together, and those who eat together

161
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,680
 stay together. And we were so pleasantly surprised, and our hearts were so warm when we saw 60,

162
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,840
 70 people all gathering to eat together. So beautiful, that's so good. But the question

163
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,640
 now is this, if you have more acquaintances than friends, then why? What do you spend

164
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,560
 your time talking about? How intentional are you in asking the other person about something?

165
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,320
 Now, here's the thing, you can ask someone, I mean, we all do. What do we ask? How are

166
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,720
 things going? They're going, "Great, the market's up and good, right? And family's

167
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,520
 just a bit rough." "Oh, cool, did you watch the tennis?" Whereas at that point, what

168
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:50,320
 you should do, "Oh, why is family rough?" Do we ask that? But we don't, right? We're

169
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,240
 like, "Oh, I think we're in a place where we shouldn't really ask about that." I think

170
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,920
 he seemed to allude to it. But you see, the thing is, if we are truly... Now, with people

171
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,240
 who are genuinely acquaintances, maybe there is a bit of need to be just a bit further

172
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,680
 back, but when we're in the church, when your brother in Christ, when your sister in Christ

173
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,400
 tells you, "Now, things have not been good at home," the worst thing we can say is, "Oh,

174
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:22,080
 sorry to hear, I'll pray for you. Okay, see you next week. Peace. Take it easy." How intentional

175
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:28,000
 are we with asking people questions? And here's the problem, when you get to know people,

176
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:38,440
 people are so annoying. People are so irritating, and we are one of them, right? But yet, that

177
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:42,760
 doesn't mean we don't do it. Which brings me to the second point. Let us consider, let

178
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,280
 us know these other people, and to stir them up. The word "stir" there actually means almost

179
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,120
 to irritate, but not in the negative sense. It means to kind of like, to sharpen them,

180
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,560
 to rub up against them in the wrong way, just to kind of like push them into something else,

181
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:05,800
 to stir them up. But we rarely stir up. We do a lot of stirring, but we rarely stir up.

182
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,440
 And that's the problem. And so my challenge to us is, if we only have more acquaintances

183
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,720
 than friends, how can we turn them from being acquaintances to being friends? And if we

184
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,840
 are part of the same church, how do we go from being friends to being family? How do

185
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,380
 we do that? I think there are people in your life that you are dodging the question, dodging

186
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,920
 the conversation with. I think there are people where you are like, "Oh, you know what? I

187
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,840
 just can't be bothered." But here's the thing. The only way you can love God more is by loving

188
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,480
 that person. There's no way really getting out of it.

189
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,240
 And so I want to ask you this. Who are your people? And there's loads of different ways

190
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,680
 to describe this, but I just want to use a very simple way. I just want to go with three.

191
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,680
 And for those of you who have been in the church, you'll know this, and I'll explain

192
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,160
 a little bit. Who's your Paul, who's your Timothy, and who's your Barnabas? Who's your

193
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,480
 Paul, Timothy, and Barnabas? I'll tell you a little bit more about them. And there's

194
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,200
 so many more different iterations of this. But first of all, who's your Paul? Who's the

195
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:06,840
 person who's pouring into you? Who's mentoring you? Young people who need mentoring. That

196
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:13,960
 mentor will not show up at your door on a day when you're free and go, "Hey, I hear

197
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,680
 you've been needing a mentor. Can I pour into your life?" Young people, that does not happen.

198
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,440
 Old people, that does not happen. You need to go and find that person. It's down to you

199
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,760
 to go and find that person. "Hey, you've got so much wisdom. You've got so much experience.

200
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,200
 I love the way you deal with your family. Can I spend some time with your family? Can

201
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,960
 I come and hang out? Can I come and have dinner? Can I come to your house and can I cook for

202
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,280
 you? Because I want to spend some time with you. I'm looking for a Paul."

203
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:49,480
 Second is you have your Timothy. Older people. You're not going to get a young person coming

204
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,280
 up to you and go, "Hey, you have so much wisdom. You have so much life experience. Can you

205
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:01,680
 teach me your ways?" That doesn't happen either. It needs you to go out of your way, to leave

206
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:08,080
 your house, to leave your sofa, and go to these young people and go, "How are you doing?"

207
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,360
 Requiring patience. Patience isn't needed just for the elderly. It's for all of us,

208
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,760
 right?

209
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,800
 Find your Timothy. So one, find your Paul. Two, find your Timothy. Who's that other person?

210
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,960
 Who's Barnabas, who doesn't get that much credit but actually is one of John's favourite

211
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:27,560
 characters in the Bible? Who's your friend? You can use Barnabas, you can use Jonathan.

212
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:30,040
 Who's your friend? Who's the one who's going to encourage you? Who's the one who's going

213
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,480
 to stir you? Who's the one who knows how to push your buttons? Maybe it's not a friend.

214
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,600
 Maybe it's not Barnabas. Maybe it's Mary to your Martha. Who's that annoying sibling who

215
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,680
 seems to just get the heart right? Whereas you're busy cooking dinner and sorting stuff

216
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,720
 out but she has the heart right and she's going to show you how to model it. Who's that

217
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:54,320
 person who's going to help you? Who's your Paul? Who's your Timothy? Who's your Barnabas?

218
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,880
 I think we have to have those three people, at least. We have to. In order for us to grow

219
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,600
 in our love for God and our love for people, we have to have those three people, at least.

220
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,200
 Think about it. How are you connected? How intentional are you?

221
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,800
 And then the second part of this is this. Not neglecting to meet together as is the

222
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,680
 habit of some. What does this tell me? Corporate gathering, corporate worship is not optional.

223
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:29,040
 It's necessary. It's essential. And this isn't just watching a sermon on YouTube because

224
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:35,320
 you're not doing it with people around you. It has to be together. You have to gather

225
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,040
 together. And this is very hard because in Hong Kong we are so busy. We are so, so busy

226
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:47,320
 with all these other things. And yet the question really is what is our priority? Do we make

227
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:51,080
 time for people? Do we make time to gather? Do you know why it's so important to not just

228
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,280
 worship and pray and read the Bible on your own? Do you know why it's so important to

229
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,480
 do it here with other people? Because when you do it here, there's less risk of it being

230
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,400
 about you. Because when you come into a big group, you're like, "Oh, it's not about me.

231
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,960
 We're all worshipping this God who's up there, who's bigger. Our God is so big, so strong

232
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,560
 and so mighty." Yet if you do it on your own, there's a tendency that we still need that

233
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:21,640
 very private part, that personal part of our faith. But actually it also needs to be public.

234
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:27,480
 It also needs to be with other people. And the word there for to meet together is this

235
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,480
 word that's very interesting. Those of you who study Greek will know this word, episunagoge.

236
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,320
 Episunagoge is a word, you may not know this word exactly, but you may recognize another

237
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:44,720
 word in it, synagogue, which is where the Jews would gather. And actually Paul is rather

238
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,240
 ambiguous with why he uses this word. Actually in the whole of the New Testament he only

239
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,600
 uses it twice. And there's probably different ways to look at this, but what I found was

240
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,480
 really interesting and what some scholars look at this and think is, you've got this

241
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,520
 need to meet, you've got this need to gather, and that's where your official assembly is,

242
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,200
 that's where your synagogue is. But the word epi, what does that mean? It means on the

243
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:10,480
 top of, it means over and above. And so what you have is this, when we're talking about

244
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,920
 church, when we're talking about meeting together, it's not just one thing that you turn up to,

245
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,080
 it's not just the 90 minutes that you're going to come to the service for. But it's something,

246
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,840
 it's over and above, it's more than that. It seeps into your everyday life. You see

247
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,920
 in the book of Acts, he talks about meeting in the temple, then he talks about going to

248
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,440
 each other's people's homes. He talks about all these other gatherings in between. So

249
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,080
 the question for us is this, how intentional are we with our gatherings? How intentional

250
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,000
 are we when meeting together, staying together, and getting involved in each other's lives?

251
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,880
 And the question isn't how are things, the question is how are you really? And so I think

252
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,600
 we have more acquaintances than friends. I also think we confuse proximity with community.

253
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,900
 And there's another quote that I really like is this, "Some people think they're in community,

254
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,080
 but they're only in proximity. True community requires commitment and openness. It is a

255
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:06,080
 willingness to extend yourself to encounter and know the other." How much do you rely

256
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,600
 on just the people around you, just proximity? "Oh, you and I are here, we're here together,

257
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,240
 this is the community." You can spend 10 years in the same community group and not know each

258
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:22,960
 other at all. So the question is, one, are we committed to meeting? Are we not giving

259
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,760
 up? Number two, when we're meeting, are we being intentional about it? Are we stirring

260
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,160
 each other up in love and good works? And then you may say, "But James, what about the

261
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:45,080
 online space? What about the metaverse? What about the meta church?" And I love social

262
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:51,880
 media. It helps us connect in ways that we've never done before. I get to FaceTime my mother,

263
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,040
 probably not as much as I really should, but I get to speak to her while she's on the other

264
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:02,200
 side of the world. I get to have all these friends, not quite 5,000, but I have Facebook

265
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:10,040
 friends, many of whom I actually don't recognise. So the question isn't actually the platform,

266
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:17,120
 because I think there is something good about this social media development that's happening.

267
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:24,160
 Zoom is a great thing. But the question still remains, how intentional are we with those

268
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:33,800
 sessions? To my shame, I was invited to a Zoom meeting, and I was like, "Oh, yeah, sure,

269
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,160
 I think I can make it," all in my mind, thinking, "Well, I'm going to make it, because I'm going

270
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,240
 to click on the Zoom link, switch off my video, mute myself, and then carry on doing my own

271
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,320
 thing." Right? Have we been there? Now, of course, there are probably meetings that maybe

272
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,200
 that's not so bad, but there's other meetings. Let's say if we are, "Oh, I only do church

273
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:00,920
 online." Yeah, well, sure, do church online. But the true measure of whether that really

274
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,160
 was church is did you stir each other up in loving good works? Did you encourage one another?

275
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:10,160
 The word "encourage" is parakaleo, which isn't just, "Oh, you're doing great, keep going,

276
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:14,920
 gayo, gayo." It's not just that. The word "encourage" there, the parakaleo means to

277
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,640
 exhort one another, to strengthen one another, to stimulate one another, to really push each

278
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:27,680
 other on. Why? Because the day is drawing near. Let me go back to that verse here. Because

279
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,480
 the day is drawing near. Why were people giving up during this time? Because they thought

280
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,200
 Jesus was coming back, and they thought he was coming back again very soon. But then

281
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,680
 day went after day after day, they're like, "Oh, [foreign language 00:05:50] why is he

282
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,560
 not back yet?" And some started giving up. Some started to kind of receive persecution.

283
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,360
 They're like, "You know what? I'm just not going to do this anymore. Just be with this

284
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:52,040
 group. There's problems there." But Paul said, "Don't. This is the time for you to really

285
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:58,360
 hone in. This is the time for you to really stick together, especially when the day is

286
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,440
 drawing near, especially when the days are getting dark."

287
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,000
 Living life on your own is not easy. There's that old proverb that says, "If you want to

288
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,080
 go somewhere fast, go alone. But if you want to go somewhere far, go together." Where we're

289
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,520
 going could still be quite far away. And I'll tell you, it's not easy. And I've shared about

290
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:25,640
 my emotional trauma that I went through through this fifth wave. How I got out of that in

291
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,360
 the way that I did? People. Not just people in proximity, not just acquaintances. I'll

292
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,400
 tell you, you can have so many friends on Facebook, but when you're in a time of need,

293
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,560
 how will they help you? Other than giving you a thumbs up. Other than giving you a like.

294
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:49,880
 Other than giving you the care emoji. The people who will help you are the ones who

295
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,900
 are right beside you. The people who will help you are the ones who ask you about you.

296
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:03,120
 The people that you ask about them. Because as the day draws near, we need that kind of

297
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,120
 encouragement. We need that kind of encouragement with people. Who are your people? And we finish

298
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,920
 here with this passage back in Acts again. Because maybe the passage in Hebrews tells

299
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,200
 us, maybe a bit of a prescription. It's telling us what to do when we meet. This one tells

300
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,600
 us, maybe a description of what was happening then. It's also telling us how they met. And

301
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,360
 how did they meet? They were all together and they had all things in common. This term,

302
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,400
 all things in common, would have been a very famous, well-known Greek philosophy term.

303
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:41,760
 What did it mean? Friendship. It meant this profound regard for one another. It meant

304
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,800
 being as one to the point where they were joined together, both spiritually, physically

305
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:53,720
 and materially. So here's the thing though, in Hong Kong. Because there is such material

306
00:26:53,720 --> 00:27:02,680
 wealth here. Because we are very much self-sufficient, the huge danger is that we stop relying on

307
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,360
 others. We start thinking that we can do it ourselves. We can do everything ourselves.

308
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,560
 Because I can afford everything I want to afford. So therefore I don't need anyone else.

309
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,600
 In fact you get so scared that other people will take what you have, so you distance them

310
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:24,640
 away. So self-sufficiency is the danger, is the enemy of community. Yet what we see here

311
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,680
 is that they were all together. They were selling their possessions, belongings and

312
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,480
 distributing the proceeds to all as any had need. Now before you get really scared and

313
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,200
 go, "I've got to sell everything?" Johnny's like, "I've got to sell my shoes? I've got

314
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:45,240
 to sell all of them?" That's not necessarily what it's talking about. What it's talking

315
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,960
 about is, because actually we know it's not everyone had to sell everything because a

316
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,800
 couple of chapters later you see Barnabas is highlighted as the one who sold his field.

317
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,800
 And then he voluntarily distributed all the profits to everyone who had need. So that

318
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,960
 wasn't a "everyone had to do this". But what it was, was that everything that you

319
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,000
 own can be made accessible and available to anyone who needed. That's what it was really

320
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,800
 talking about. When there's someone who is in need, then whatever you have you are able

321
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:22,120
 to share with them. You're able to allow them to use it as they had need. And so that was

322
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,480
 really what they were saying. And so day by day, attending the temple together, breaking

323
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,160
 bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts. You see

324
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,040
 the thing is this, when we realise that we need each other, that's when we start to promote

325
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,840
 these kingdom values. These kingdom values of sharing. The kingdom is much more about

326
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,000
 solidarity and mutuality than any kind of class system that we see here on earth. It's

327
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,560
 about God's grace isn't just for the rich and famous, it's for everyone. God's love

328
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:01,280
 is accessible to all in an unconditional kind of way. Do we live that out? Are we allowing

329
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,640
 ourselves to be in this place where we were together and had all things in common? And

330
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,680
 you're like, "How did they get there? How did they get there? And how do we get there?"

331
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,400
 And I want to quickly share three things how they got there. I want you to rewind. How

332
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,040
 did they get there? Well actually the three things is one, you need the Holy Spirit. Two,

333
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,920
 you need to be cut to the heart. And third, you need to be filled with awe and wonder.

334
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,880
 Those are the three things for us to get to a community like this. How does KFCI get there?

335
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,880
 These three things. First, Holy Spirit. We see Acts 2. We see Peter shares his message.

336
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:40,040
 And suddenly the Holy Spirit comes on them and that's when they're... And then what happens?

337
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,800
 Number two, they are cut to the heart. The Holy Spirit cuts them to the heart. They realise

338
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,000
 how much they need a saviour. They realise how much they need each other. They realise

339
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,760
 how much they love each other. And then what happens just before this? And they were filled

340
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,360
 with awe and wonder. When your eyes are fixed on something else, when you are cut to the

341
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,640
 heart, when you have the Holy Spirit within you, you're like, "Who needs something? I

342
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,920
 can help." But when we don't have the Holy Spirit, when we are not cut to the heart,

343
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,480
 when our hearts are hardened, when we are not filled with awe, when we're not worshipping

344
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,240
 God but worshipping ourselves, that's when we go very far from this. So the question

345
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,800
 for us is, now as a church, I've asked you about your acquaintances and your friends.

346
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:28,800
 Next question is this, how much do you care and love God himself? How much do you yearn

347
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,080
 for him? Because the question here is, if we're to get to this place, if we're to be

348
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:38,600
 a community-based church, we need to have our eyes on God. We need to be chasing and

349
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,040
 loving God ourselves. That's the way we get this. C.S. Lewis again says this, "Friendship

350
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,200
 is born at the moment when one man says to another, 'What? You too? I thought I was the

351
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:56,200
 only one.'" That's what we should be like. As we gather here and we're trying to build

352
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:03,120
 friendship, it should be like, "I'm worshipping God. I love God so much. You too? That's awesome.

353
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,720
 Let's love God together." That's what it should be. And here's the other problem with a lot

354
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,720
 of our churches, a lot of us in Hong Kong, we struggle with community. We turn up to

355
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,360
 church after church, we sit in these services, we stay for the 90 minutes, and then we leave

356
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,760
 and then we're like, "I couldn't find community in that church. I couldn't find community

357
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,840
 in this church." You see, the thing is, when we gather, the point isn't to find a place

358
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,680
 where there will be a community that fits around you. When we gather, it's to worship

359
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,160
 God, it's to be cut to the heart, it's to be filled with awe and wonder, and then pray

360
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:47,560
 that we look to the side of us and go, "What? You too? This is awesome." That's what community

361
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:54,640
 is. Us being so focused on God, that being the one thing that we're asking for, Psalm

362
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:00,320
 27, that being the one thirst that we have. You know, our good friend Francis who preached

363
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,040
 here last year, he once shared this with me, he said, "Never has a spirit-filled marriage

364
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,120
 ever ended in divorce." Never has a spirit-filled marriage ended in divorce. Why? Because when

365
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,040
 your marriage, when each person is filled with the Spirit, they can't help but just

366
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,880
 be pursuing and worshipping God, and it's the Spirit that will keep them as one. The

367
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,800
 Spirit that will cut them to the heart is the Spirit who will leave them in awe and

368
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,960
 wonder, and because of that, husband and wife will be as close as ever. I think that same

369
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,440
 principle can be applied to church, can be applied to our church here. If all of our

370
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:35,920
 members are truly filled with the Spirit, cut to the heart, and filled with awe and

371
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:45,040
 wonder, then we won't divide. Then we will be as one. So the question is this, is this

372
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:52,760
 something that we want? Do we truly love God? Because that's how we'll get community. Because

373
00:32:52,760 --> 00:33:00,280
 when you love God, you'll end up loving people. So here's the conclusion. If you're looking

374
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:09,520
 for God, you will find him amongst his people. If you're wanting to love God more, then you

375
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,600
 really should try to love people. If you're really struggling to love people, that highlights

376
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,440
 that you've still got some ways to go when it comes to loving God. And you'll say, "James,

377
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,440
 this is so hard. One, I don't have the time." To that, I'm just like, "Well, it's just a

378
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:34,440
 priority thing, isn't it? We all have the same amount of time." So have a think about

379
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,700
 that. How can I love people more? How can I do this more? "But I've been hurt so much

380
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:46,120
 in the past." I know. I was just talking to a friend the other day whose friends and family

381
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,720
 have just been completely turning against her. And to be fair, I don't think they know

382
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:56,000
 what they're doing. And she's been so hurt and she has every right to completely cut

383
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,640
 them out of their lives, her life. And all I could say was, "I know. I get it. I feel

384
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,920
 it. But I think we have precedence for this. I think we have a template to follow." The

385
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,360
 moment Jesus was on the cross and said, "Father, forgive them for they know not what they do."

386
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,040
 The moment he was having his last supper with the guy that was just about to betray him

387
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,760
 and sell him for 30 silver coins. What does Jesus do? If I was there at that moment, I

388
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,440
 would not be doing the thing that Jesus does next with this guy, Judas. He takes off his

389
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:36,320
 robe, kneels down, and he washes this guy's feet without addressing anything, without

390
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,680
 any passive aggressive comment. So we have precedence for this, brothers and sisters,

391
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:49,600
 to bear with one another, as it says in Ephesians, to be reasonable because God is here. And

392
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,400
 we still have to seek out community. We still have to seek out people. Why? Because Jesus

393
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:01,400
 sought us out. Because Jesus went out of his way for us. So the next time we think, "Oh,

394
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,280
 do I really want to meet that person? Do I really want to go and talk to that person?

395
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,320
 Should I really start and open this kind of worms?" It will really expend time and energy

396
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,000
 that I don't have. It means I have to go out of my way. That's what the cross is for. To

397
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,400
 remind us that Jesus, who though was in the form of God, did not count equality with God

398
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,480
 a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, went out of his way, and came out of his way

399
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,320
 for you, and sought out communion for you, knowing that you need communion, knowing your

400
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,320
 deep need for connection, he came to you. And so therefore we must go to them.

401
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,560
 There's one final thing I wanted to highlight in this passage here. Why is community so

402
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,240
 important? Because of this last bit. Praising God and having favor with all the people,

403
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,760
 and the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved. Community.

404
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:04,800
 A community-based church then fulfills the great commission. Because a kind, loving,

405
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,160
 hospitable community is what attracts people to the gospel. And isn't that what we should

406
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,860
 all be doing? You might be here saying, "Oh, go therefore and disciple all the nations

407
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,920
 and teach them what I've commanded. Oh, it's hard to do on my own." Well then Jesus is

408
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,540
 saying, "I don't need you to do it on your own. I need you to be in community. And when

409
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:28,280
 you have a community that is healthy, that loves me, that is filled with the Holy Spirit,

410
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,840
 that is cut to the heart, and that is filled with awe and wonder, I will add to your numbers

411
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:39,160
 day by day." And then this church will grow. Not because we want numbers to grow, but because

412
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,040
 that's what we want. There is news to share, and so therefore we must share it. So therefore

413
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,800
 we must be the kind of community that attracts people in. But what's the one thing they talk

414
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,240
 about when they say about the church? "You guys are just as bad as us. You guys are worse

415
00:36:53,240 --> 00:37:00,240
 than us." But Jesus prays in John 17, "Be as one so that others will believe in me."

416
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:06,080
 Have good works so others will praise your Father in heaven. Being in community is so

417
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:12,080
 necessary, it's not optional, because it helps us fulfil the Great Commission. And you might

418
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,140
 say, "Well, what are we? I mean, we've got 70 people here, 80 people, sometimes 100.

419
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:22,280
 What can we do to save the world? The city is filled with darkness. Everything around

420
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:28,880
 us seems tasteless." Well, isn't that exactly what we've been placed here to do? In the

421
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:36,520
 midst of that darkness, be the light. In the midst of that tastelessness, be the salt.

422
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,640
 Isn't that what we're supposed to do? But we're only a small group. How can we do it?

423
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,540
 We don't have enough manpower to do this. It's not us that does it. And the Lord added

424
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:56,280
 to their number day by day, "Do not underestimate what we have here so long as we stay together."

425
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:03,080
 There's one final quote to leave you with. "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful,

426
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:10,720
 committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has." "Never

427
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:18,560
 doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it

428
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,560
 is the only thing that ever has." Let's pray.

429
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:39,800
 Lord, forgive us when we fall short in being your body, when we're arguing, the eyes arguing

430
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:52,320
 with the foot, the hands arguing with the leg. And yet, you've hidden it in a clause

431
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,520
 in ways that only you know, in reasons only you know, where people will only believe in

432
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:07,360
 you when we are as one, when we are committed into being a community-based church, one that

433
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,880
 is filled with more friends and family than acquaintances, one that gathers not just because

434
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:22,120
 we're in proximity, but because we are bound together by what you did for us.

435
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:32,280
 And so I pray, earnestly, sincerely, as we turn our eyes to you and as we worship you,

436
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:41,280
 would you send us a Paul? Would you send us a Timothy? Would you send us a Barnabas? Would

437
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,640
 you send us people to love? Because we know that by loving people, we're able to love

438
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:58,340
 you more. We pray for those who feel isolated, disconnected, lonely. We yearn for connection

439
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:07,600
 for them. We yearn for communion and we thank you that by what you did, you reconciled us

440
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:18,240
 to the Father. And because of you, we are able to abide, be connected with you.

441
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:27,720
 The Lord let us not stop just there. As we learn what it means to abide in you, may we

442
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,960
 learn how to love others around us. So Holy Spirit, would you fill each heart in this

443
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:40,500
 room as we seek to be a community-based church. Would you cut us to the heart and show us

444
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:47,040
 how much we not only need you, but we need each other. And then would you fill us with

445
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:56,960
 awe and wonder of how great and majestic you are, how worthy of everything you are, and

446
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,640
 allow us to be together, to not give up in meeting, but to encourage one another, to

447
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:12,520
 stir each other up in love and good works. All because you first loved us. All because

448
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:21,280
 you sought us out first. So remind us next time to practically apply this message to

449
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,400
 that we would seek out community, that we would seek out God's people, that we would

450
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,680
 seek out our brothers and sisters. Because it's the only way to love you. In your name

451
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,000
 we pray. Amen.

452
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,840
 Bye.

453
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,680
 Amen.

454
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,740
 you
