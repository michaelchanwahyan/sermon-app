1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,040
 Once again, it's been an amazing series, hasn't it been?

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,520
 The Women of the Old Testament.

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,280
 And we went through so many different women.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,480
 And each of them have their own struggle.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,160
 Each of them have their own story.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,320
 Each of them have their own faith in God

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,800
 and sometimes some doubt.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,360
 And so today we are gonna go through the book of Ruth.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,560
 And so read with me as we read the first verse,

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,200
 first verses together.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,360
 One, two, three.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,720
 In the days when the judges ruled,

14
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,000
 there was a famine in the land.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,680
 And a man of Bethlehem and Judah,

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,840
 who sojourned in a country of Moab,

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,080
 he and his wife and had two sons.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,640
 The name of the man was Elimelech,

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,320
 and the name of his wife, Naomi.

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,640
 And the names of his two sons were Malon and Chilion.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,280
 They were Ephratites from Bethlehem in Judah.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,320
 They went to the country of Moab and remained there.

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,680
 So the story starts off.

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,360
 And the writer tells us, what time is it?

25
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,780
 What's happening during this time?

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,120
 These are the times of judges.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,180
 And so Israel had not had kings yet.

28
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,880
 They had something called judges.

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,760
 And these were leaders that were appointed by the Lord

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,560
 to lead them sometimes in times of battle,

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,880
 sometimes to lead them spiritually and with prophecy.

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,880
 And so we see this family here,

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,560
 Elimelech and his wife, Naomi.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,120
 And something happens, right?

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,800
 They move to a different country.

36
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,360
 They move to Moab.

37
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,380
 And their intention, it says here, sojourn.

38
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,360
 It means that they didn't intend to stay there permanently,

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,200
 but they tended to just stay there for a while.

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,280
 And so I'm gonna explain this story in seven episodes.

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,160
 And the first episode is this, the famine menace.

42
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,100
 There's a threat, a famine has appeared.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:18,620
 Why would you leave from your home to another country?

44
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,280
 It must have been so bad to a point where you said,

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
 we can't stay here any longer.

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,080
 We can't survive here.

47
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,440
 We gotta leave.

48
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,280
 And so they made this decision.

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,780
 And so they left the promised land.

50
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,600
 But isn't it that God said this was the land

51
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,920
 flowing of milk and honey?

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,780
 It's interesting.

53
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,720
 It's quite interesting.

54
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,600
 And so we see here this family moves from Bethlehem

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,480
 across the Jordan River to Moab.

56
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,080
 And some people think, well, maybe they're disobeying God.

57
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,400
 Right, maybe they're disobeying God.

58
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,800
 How could you go out from the promised land,

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,140
 the will of God for your people?

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,500
 When it also mentions in the Bible that the promise is

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,280
 if Israel obeys the Lord,

62
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,840
 then this land would prosper.

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,200
 And so possibly Israel was disobeying God at this time,

64
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,200
 and that is why the Lord was punishing them with a famine.

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,780
 And we see this throughout the world, right?

66
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,680
 When there is something happening in your country,

67
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,360
 could be a famine, it could be a war,

68
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,400
 what happens to these families?

69
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,840
 They move.

70
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,000
 And we're seeing that.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,520
 Syria, there's a huge war, and these people think

72
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,080
 we can't survive here any longer.

73
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,360
 And they move.

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,240
 And this is what happened to this family.

75
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,080
 The head of this family was Elimelech,

76
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,160
 and his name meant God is king.

77
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,280
 And yet, does he live as if God is king of his life?

78
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,940
 As if he's trusting in God to provide?

79
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,840
 That's one of the questions the commentaries sometimes pose

80
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,640
 and question whether they're leaving God's plan.

81
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,640
 And we see here Naomi, her name means pleasant or lovely.

82
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:42,040
 And so episode one, the famine menace.

83
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,040
 Episode two, tragedy strikes back.

84
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,880
 Read with me.

85
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,680
 But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi died,

86
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,680
 and she was left with her two sons.

87
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,520
 These took Moabab wives, and named one of them was Orpah,

88
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,840
 and the name of the other was Ruth.

89
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,280
 And they lived there about 10 years.

90
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,320
 Both Malion and Chilion died,

91
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,680
 so that the woman was left without her two sons

92
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,880
 and her husband.

93
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,320
 Wow.

94
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,480
 Famine strikes, you move.

95
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,680
 You're hoping for a better place, right?

96
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,560
 This must be a better place.

97
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,640
 But what happens?

98
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,300
 Your husband dies, the head of your family.

99
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,360
 And then what happens after that?

100
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,540
 Your two sons die as well.

101
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,300
 They were just gonna stay there for a couple years, right?

102
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,860
 It ends up to be 10 years.

103
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,100
 10 years.

104
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:56,060
 And what happens is that these women are childless widows.

105
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,900
 Childless widows.

106
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:06,860
 What do you think it meant to be a childless widow

107
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,940
 in the ancient Near East?

108
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,700
 Was it a position of power and wealth, or was it?

109
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,380
 No.

110
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:19,020
 Women didn't have the same rights you guys do

111
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,100
 to buy property and all that good stuff, right?

112
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,100
 Back then, widows, they depended on a male.

113
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,180
 A male to help them, right?

114
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,140
 To have land, to have protection.

115
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,660
 And so because they didn't have that,

116
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,700
 these childless widows were considered the poorest people

117
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,380
 in the ancient Near East.

118
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,100
 They depended on the generosity of others.

119
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:55,060
 And we see here Orpha, her name means back of the neck

120
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,260
 or stiff neck, and Ruth, it means friend.

121
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,280
 It means friend.

122
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,220
 What would you do if you were Naomi?

123
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,420
 Imagine yourself in her shoes.

124
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,700
 You've basically lost everything.

125
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,100
 You're like Job.

126
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,460
 Imagine the people you love most in your life,

127
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,860
 and they've died.

128
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,420
 What would you do?

129
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,940
 What would you do?

130
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,500
 You've hit rock bottom.

131
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,500
 You're without your treasured family members.

132
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,460
 You're considered poor, without protection.

133
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,900
 What would you do?

134
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,540
 Has anybody been rock bottom before?

135
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,660
 Have they?

136
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,060
 Yeah, some people, good.

137
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,100
 Not good, I mean.

138
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,220
 Good that you understand me, I mean, yes.

139
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,220
 (audience laughing)

140
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:06,540
 Episode three, the faith awakens.

141
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,740
 The faith awakens.

142
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,060
 Read with me.

143
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,140
 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law

144
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,860
 to return from the country of Moab,

145
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,180
 for she had heard of the fields of Moab,

146
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,980
 that the Lord had visited the people and given them food.

147
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,060
 So she set out from a place where she was

148
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,700
 with her two daughters-in-law,

149
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,660
 and they went on their way to return to the land of Judah.

150
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:34,300
 But Naomi said to her daughters-in-law,

151
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,020
 "Go, return each of you to her mother's house.

152
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,400
 "May the Lord deal kindly with you

153
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,540
 "as you have dealt with the dead and with me."

154
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,340
 So she hears, you know, and I don't know

155
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,500
 what she was doing in the field.

156
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,660
 Maybe she was working the field.

157
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,140
 Maybe she was gathering some wheat,

158
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,540
 leftover wheat or whatnot.

159
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,980
 But she hears, "The Lord is doing something.

160
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,820
 "I've lost everything in this land.

161
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,980
 "What are my options?"

162
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,500
 Well, maybe there's no option left.

163
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,720
 It's time to go home.

164
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,900
 It's time to go home.

165
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,900
 And so she takes sort of a step of faith to go home.

166
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,740
 She's walking on her way, right,

167
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,340
 with her two daughters-in-law.

168
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,700
 You know, when you walk in the streets of Hong Kong,

169
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,860
 it's very safe, right?

170
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,080
 Do you fear for your life?

171
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,660
 You don't.

172
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,540
 You don't.

173
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,840
 Hong Kong is one of the safest places to be at.

174
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,380
 You know, I've traveled a lot,

175
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,060
 and I've gotta say, I don't worry about, you know,

176
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,720
 my bag getting stolen or whatnot.

177
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,340
 I feel safe in Hong Kong.

178
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,020
 Imagine three childless widows

179
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,020
 traveling back along the way by themselves.

180
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,820
 We've heard Jesus' parable before, haven't we,

181
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,460
 of the good Samaritan, right?

182
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,700
 People robbed.

183
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,460
 You know, there's no real borders like we have today

184
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,940
 and protection of laws and whatnot.

185
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,540
 Who knows what could have happened?

186
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,740
 So she took a step of faith.

187
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,820
 I hear God is doing something.

188
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,020
 Let me go.

189
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,220
 And as she goes along the way,

190
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,140
 she stops and she's like,

191
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,300
 my daughter's-in-law.

192
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:38,860
 There's no point for you to follow me.

193
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,420
 It's better for you to just go back.

194
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,380
 And this was her reasoning, right?

195
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,940
 You can go back to your home.

196
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,860
 You belong in Moab, right?

197
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,500
 These are your people, your family,

198
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,660
 and you can go and find a new husband.

199
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,780
 And that'd be great.

200
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,140
 You know, you have somebody to protect you,

201
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,380
 provide for you.

202
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,300
 It's gonna be awesome.

203
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,820
 Go find another husband.

204
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,940
 And she's like, why are you following me?

205
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,300
 I'm too old to find another husband, right?

206
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,500
 If I got married today, you know,

207
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,940
 maybe she's like 60,

208
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,140
 and I get married today and I have a child,

209
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,780
 you know, God blesses me on my wedding night, you know?

210
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,860
 Careful, careful, John says.

211
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,980
 60s young, sorry, 60s young.

212
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,060
 I mean, yeah, who knows with technology nowadays?

213
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,220
 Maybe they had better technology back then.

214
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,940
 If God blesses me and I have a child tonight,

215
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,220
 you know, are you gonna wait for my child,

216
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,180
 my sons to grow up?

217
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,980
 And then you're gonna marry them?

218
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,700
 That's her reasoning, right?

219
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,380
 It's just like, there's no point for you to follow me.

220
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,980
 You have a family and you have potential

221
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,020
 to restore your lives.

222
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:01,940
 And so what would you do if you were Orpha and Ruth?

223
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,700
 Go talk to the people beside you.

224
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,100
 What would you do if you were Orpha or Ruth?

225
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,020
 Would you follow Naomi?

226
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,060
 Go back or would you go back home?

227
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,620
 Go, discuss, come on, couple seconds.

228
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,660
 30 seconds.

229
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:18,260
 Life decision in 30 seconds, go.

230
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:32,220
 Okay, all right.

231
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,020
 If you were these daughters-in-law,

232
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,620
 who would go back home?

233
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,220
 Raise your hand.

234
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,740
 Who would go back home?

235
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,580
 All right, I see maybe 1/3, 1/3.

236
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,900
 Are you sure?

237
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,540
 Final answer?

238
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,220
 Final answer, okay.

239
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,580
 You win a million dollars, I'm joking.

240
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:56,540
 Honestly, if I was the daughter-in-law,

241
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,500
 it would logically make more sense for me to go back.

242
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,820
 Yeah, go back, head back, yes, head back.

243
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,220
 Right, that's where my family is.

244
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,540
 They can offer me some protection.

245
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,340
 They can maybe provide and arrange another marriage

246
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,700
 or whatnot.

247
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,380
 That would make sense.

248
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,380
 And in fact, that is what Orpha decides to do.

249
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,900
 Orpha decides, oh no, no, I'll go with you, Naomi.

250
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,540
 Ruth says, I'll go with you too.

251
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,540
 But then Naomi insists, no, no, go, go.

252
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,460
 It's better.

253
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:35,020
 And so Orpha leaves.

254
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,020
 And then Ruth is just still standing there.

255
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,820
 And Naomi's like, Ruth, what are you doing?

256
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,900
 Go follow.

257
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,300
 Follow Orpha, go back, just like her.

258
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,980
 But she says this.

259
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,100
 Let's read it together.

260
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,020
 She says this.

261
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,460
 It's a very famous God, famous quote here.

262
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,860
 Not famous God.

263
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,740
 Verse 15, see, your sister-in-law has gone back

264
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,260
 to her people and to her gods.

265
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,860
 Return after your sister-in-law.

266
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,220
 But Ruth said, do not urge me to leave you

267
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,660
 or to return from following you.

268
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,340
 For where you go, I will go.

269
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,140
 And where I lodge, I will lodge.

270
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,900
 Your people shall be my people.

271
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,500
 And your God, my God.

272
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,060
 Where you die, I will die.

273
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,260
 And there will I be buried.

274
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,180
 May the Lord do to me and more also to anything

275
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:37,020
 that put death apart, parts, death parts me from you.

276
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,940
 Wow.

277
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,980
 This is the statement Ruth makes.

278
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,700
 Your God will be my God.

279
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,620
 Your people will be my people.

280
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,660
 This woman leaves everything.

281
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:01,260
 Her family, her friends, her home, her religion,

282
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:06,700
 her chance of remarriage because her faith awakens.

283
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:15,300
 There's a supernatural awakening of her faith.

284
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,180
 She had no reason to believe this other religion,

285
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,700
 this other gods.

286
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,820
 She's probably never been to Israel or to Bethlehem.

287
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:30,780
 But somehow there's a faith that awakens inside of her

288
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,900
 and potentially what happens is,

289
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,700
 you know, Naomi has set such a great example

290
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,660
 and they have such a great relationship

291
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,260
 that she doesn't want to leave her.

292
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,140
 We don't know exactly,

293
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,180
 but we can maybe take an educated guess.

294
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,180
 And so these two women go back to Jerusalem,

295
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,420
 to Bethlehem.

296
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,420
 And it's like seeing old friends after 10 years.

297
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:07,980
 Have you seen your high school friends

298
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,220
 after a couple of years?

299
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,500
 Oh, what are you up to?

300
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,860
 You know, what's going on?

301
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,340
 And they're the talk of the town, right?

302
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,380
 It says here the whole town was stirred

303
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,380
 and they say, is this Naomi?

304
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,420
 Is it you?

305
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,420
 Maybe she's 10 years, you know.

306
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,420
 (audience laughing)

307
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,300
 Who knows what I'll look like in 10 years,

308
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,580
 maybe younger, I'm joking.

309
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:36,580
 (audience laughing)

310
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,460
 I'm growing my hair.

311
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:47,100
 She changes her name.

312
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,580
 Why does she change her name?

313
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,860
 She says, don't call me Naomi.

314
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,860
 Call me Mara, for the Lord has dealt bitterly with me.

315
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,380
 What did her name mean before?

316
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:12,620
 Lovingly, pleasant, and now it's turned purple.

317
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,500
 (audience laughing)

318
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,580
 And green to bitterness.

319
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,700
 So dramatic.

320
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,820
 I mean, I didn't even set that up myself.

321
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,980
 (audience laughing)

322
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,500
 Back then, they would only change their name

323
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,180
 from Abram to Abraham,

324
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,660
 from Jacob to Israel.

325
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,660
 After they had a great change of experience

326
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,620
 or an encounter with God.

327
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:51,700
 And so you can imagine the state that she was at.

328
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,620
 Rock bottom.

329
00:17:53,620 --> 00:18:00,180
 Episode five, a new hope.

330
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,260
 A new hope.

331
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,100
 And we're gonna see that they're gonna devise a plan.

332
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:13,700
 Trust God's providence and end with praise.

333
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,180
 Read with me.

334
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,220
 Now Naomi had a relative of her husband's,

335
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,140
 a worthy man of the clan of Elimelech,

336
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,100
 whose name was Boaz.

337
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,020
 And Ruth and the Moabite said to Naomi,

338
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,260
 let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain.

339
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,020
 After him, whose sight I shall find favor.

340
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,540
 And she said to her, go, my daughter.

341
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:45,220
 So they go back?

342
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,220
 They could have just sat there and begged for food

343
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,780
 and no, they didn't.

344
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,060
 Ruth was hardworking.

345
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,460
 She was like, I'm determined.

346
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,460
 I wanna do something about it.

347
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,060
 We may be poor, we may be rock bottom.

348
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,140
 Nobody is protecting us, standing up for us,

349
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,100
 but no, I wanna do something about it.

350
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,580
 And so she was willing to give up her time

351
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,940
 for her mother-in-law.

352
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,020
 And so she goes and gleans in the field.

353
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,140
 Gleaning is what?

354
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,900
 We can see in this next picture,

355
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,700
 it's picking up the extra pieces of wheat or barley

356
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,380
 that the reapers didn't get.

357
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,380
 And in fact, that was actually an instruction from the Lord

358
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,140
 that you should help the poor and the widows

359
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,300
 by allowing them to glean in your fields,

360
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,340
 pick up the scraps.

361
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,500
 And so she's, you know, la la la la la,

362
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,540
 I'm gonna go glean.

363
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,380
 You know, I love barley.

364
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,780
 You know, she's, I don't know,

365
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,500
 like just hopping around.

366
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,660
 There's a bounce in her step.

367
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,340
 You know, she sees the fields.

368
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,140
 It's like, it's harvest time, wow.

369
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,780
 Let's go pick up some barley.

370
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,860
 Gleaning, you know, is her new hobby.

371
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,740
 You know, she goes and she stumbles upon the field

372
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,140
 of this man named Boaz.

373
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,060
 It just so happens.

374
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,340
 Like, wow.

375
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,260
 Providence.

376
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,260
 And who is this man?

377
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,020
 Well, Boaz is actually a relative,

378
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,980
 a relative of Elimelech.

379
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,780
 And so here we see a classic story.

380
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,020
 Boaz, boy meets girl.

381
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,340
 Who's this new girl in my school?

382
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,300
 Oh, where is she from?

383
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,620
 Oh, she's from, I don't know, Toronto.

384
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,580
 I don't know.

385
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:56,700
 Oh, what's her family situation like?

386
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,540
 Ah, I see, I see.

387
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:02,500
 Okay, that's interesting.

388
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,420
 Let's invite her to a meal.

389
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,340
 I'm interested in this new girl, right?

390
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,780
 And then what does Boaz do?

391
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,020
 Boaz tells the reapers, oh, just by the way,

392
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,900
 leave some extra barley along the way

393
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,900
 so that this girl could be provided for.

394
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,900
 Boy meets girl.

395
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,900
 Boy meets girl.

396
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:35,020
 And so, you know, Ruth is so excited.

397
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,420
 You know, she goes back home,

398
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,620
 she brings some of the barley she's collected

399
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,740
 and some of the extra food that she's got

400
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,300
 from the meal with Boaz.

401
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,020
 And Naomi, you know, she's been, I don't know,

402
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,700
 cleaning up the house the whole day.

403
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,940
 And she's like, hey, Ruth, what are you up to?

404
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,300
 You look like God has blessed you.

405
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
 Who have you met?

406
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,820
 Where have you gleaned?

407
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,780
 You know, it's like your mom, you know?

408
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,380
 When you come home, oh, where did you go today?

409
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,540
 How you doing?

410
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,380
 How's school?

411
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,260
 How's work?

412
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,340
 That's like your mom, right?

413
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,980
 And this is what Naomi does.

414
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,940
 And Naomi learns that she's gleaned where?

415
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,900
 In the fields of Boaz.

416
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,300
 And then they are like, wow, that's so cool.

417
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,540
 This man is a close relative of ours.

418
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,820
 Whoa, that's so cool.

419
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,260
 What are the chances?

420
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,580
 I mean, I live in Bethlehem.

421
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,260
 There can't be that many people, right?

422
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,260
 And he's one of our redeemers.

423
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,260
 And they're like, wow, Naomi's like praising God.

424
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,100
 Wow, it's amazing.

425
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,300
 Plan, providence, praise.

426
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,740
 And we see here, what is a redeemer?

427
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,740
 Any ideas what a redeemer is?

428
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,180
 Anybody have a redeemer in their life?

429
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
 It's a trick question.

430
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,380
 You should all say yes, but yes, yeah, I know.

431
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,340
 What are the responsibilities of a redeemer back then?

432
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,940
 Firstly, avenging the death of a murdered relative.

433
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,940
 Next, you're supposed to marry a childless widow

434
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,940
 of a deceased brother.

435
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,940
 So if your brother is married and he dies,

436
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,220
 you have sort of the responsibility or the privilege

437
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,580
 to marry your brother's wife.

438
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,140
 Anybody would like to do that?

439
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,660
 George?

440
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,140
 No, I'm joking, George.

441
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,220
 Redeemer.

442
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,180
 Redeemer.

443
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:45,340
 You also had the privilege of buying back land

444
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,380
 that had been sold.

445
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,460
 Maybe you sold it for whatever reason,

446
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,700
 and this is what the redeemer does.

447
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,180
 And also, buying back a member who has been sold to slavery.

448
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,180
 And also, you're to take care of the needy and the helpless.

449
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,980
 This is the responsibilities of a redeemer.

450
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,460
 And they, Ruth just so happened

451
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,700
 to go into the fields of Boaz, a wealthy man,

452
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,180
 honorable man, upright, generous.

453
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,020
 Wow.

454
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:24,340
 Episode six, the return of Ruth.

455
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,860
 The return of Ruth.

456
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,740
 Once again, we see this same strategy,

457
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,740
 or same sequence.

458
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,740
 They make a plan, we see providence,

459
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:45,500
 and then we wait for the praise.

460
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,820
 So let's read together.

461
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,020
 One, two, three.

462
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,020
 Then Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her,

463
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:56,300
 "My daughter, should I not seek rest for you,

464
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,200
 "that it may be well with you?

465
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,080
 "Is not Boaz our relative, with whose young women you were?

466
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,640
 "See, he is winnowing barley tonight at threshing floor.

467
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,600
 "Wash, therefore, and anoint yourself,

468
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,160
 "and put on cloak, and go down to the threshing floor.

469
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,460
 "But do not make yourself known to the man

470
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,180
 "until he had finished eating and drinking.

471
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,920
 "But when he lies down, observe the place where he lies,

472
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,920
 "then go and uncover his feet and lie down,

473
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,120
 "and he will tell you what to do."

474
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,940
 And she replied, "All that you say, I will do."

475
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,280
 So they make a plan.

476
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,480
 Somehow, Naomi has this plan.

477
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,680
 Instead of wearing your widow clothes,

478
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,680
 now get dressed up, right?

479
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,360
 Put on this cloak, put on this new dress,

480
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,680
 and then anoint yourself.

481
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,360
 It's just like, put on makeup.

482
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,660
 Instead of saying you're a widow and you're mourning,

483
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,600
 say, "Now you're available.

484
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,980
 "You're single, and you're ready to mingle.

485
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,300
 (audience laughing)

486
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,960
 "Let Boaz know.

487
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,560
 "Let George know.

488
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:15,120
 "Let George know."

489
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,040
 And so where does this happen?

490
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,320
 Well, it happens in a place where they're

491
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:30,240
 separating barley from the straw.

492
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,860
 What a romantic place.

493
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,680
 So somehow there's a plan

494
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:44,000
 that Boaz is gonna drink and eat,

495
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,400
 and he's gonna fall asleep.

496
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,640
 We don't know why he's there.

497
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,360
 Usually, you know, upright, you know, not upright.

498
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,080
 I mean, usually rich people,

499
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,560
 they have other people doing this.

500
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,440
 Why is he doing it?

501
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,640
 We don't know.

502
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,680
 But somehow, it's providence.

503
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,920
 And he's there, he drinks, he eats,

504
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,000
 and he falls asleep, and here comes Roof.

505
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,560
 Is he asleep?

506
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,560
 We don't know.

507
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,760
 He's asleep now, yes.

508
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,720
 We don't know.

509
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,720
 ♪ Da da da da da da ♪

510
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,280
 And he's sleeping, maybe he's snoring,

511
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,240
 and he uncovers, she uncovers his feet.

512
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,500
 I don't know, maybe they get cold feet back then.

513
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,940
 Or maybe, I don't know, cold feet.

514
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:39,880
 And so they have cold feet, and he wakes up.

515
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,200
 You know, wow, my feet is so cold.

516
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,120
 What's happening here?

517
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
 Who is this woman?

518
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,640
 It's pitch black, who are you?

519
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,000
 And then Boaz is like, who are you?

520
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,040
 You know, what are you doing here?

521
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,160
 And Roof is like, I am Roof.

522
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,960
 I need a redeemer.

523
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,680
 Will you be my redeemer?

524
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,800
 It says here, who are you?

525
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,000
 And she answered, I am Roof, your servant.

526
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,880
 Spread your wings over your servant,

527
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,480
 for you are a redeemer.

528
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,520
 She's saying, I need help.

529
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,840
 Will you redeem me?

530
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,120
 And what does Boaz say?

531
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,640
 May you be blessed by the Lord, my daughter.

532
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,780
 You have made this last kindness greater

533
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,660
 than the first that you.

534
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:30,040
 Have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich,

535
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,440
 and now, my daughter, do not fear.

536
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,040
 I will do for you all that you ask,

537
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,900
 for all my fellow townsmen know that you are a worthy woman.

538
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,600
 And now, it is true that I am a redeemer,

539
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,760
 yet there is another redeemer nearer than I.

540
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,040
 Remain here, I'm gonna sort it out tomorrow.

541
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,480
 Boaz blesses her.

542
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,880
 May the Lord grant you favor.

543
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:04,820
 Roof is a worthy, upright, honorable woman.

544
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,160
 And he says, I'm willing to redeem.

545
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,880
 Take up this task.

546
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,620
 Get ready, George.

547
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:22,080
 Episode six, the rise of the redeemer.

548
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,200
 The rise of the redeemer.

549
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,440
 So what happened back then?

550
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,200
 Well, they would usually go to the town gate

551
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,560
 or something like that, and they would meet, right?

552
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,160
 And they would have 10 witnesses,

553
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,720
 'cause that's how things are passed officially,

554
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,960
 with witnesses.

555
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,280
 And so Boaz goes and meets the redeemer

556
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,720
 that is closer to Limelech and Ruth,

557
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,080
 and they're compromising.

558
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,040
 Hey, how you doing?

559
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,720
 Good to meet you, handshake.

560
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,360
 And hey, let me tell you, there's Naomi and Ruth,

561
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,080
 and they're back, and you are the closest relative.

562
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,000
 Congratulations.

563
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,520
 Do you wanna redeem them?

564
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,120
 And the guy's like, yeah, I wanna redeem them.

565
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,360
 You know, it's awesome.

566
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,180
 I can help them restore their land

567
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,900
 and also help protect them.

568
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,800
 It's gonna be great.

569
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,160
 I will redeem it.

570
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,120
 And then Boaz is like, bet, if you redeem them,

571
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,560
 you will also have to marry a Moabite.

572
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:23,200
 And he's like, I cannot redeem.

573
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,240
 This I cannot do, for whatever reason.

574
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,760
 We don't know exactly.

575
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,040
 Maybe he was already married,

576
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,580
 or he had other things going on.

577
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,000
 And so I can't redeem it.

578
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,120
 You redeem it.

579
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,420
 And so they had this, I don't know,

580
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:45,420
 sandal flipping contest to say, it's official.

581
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,500
 Instead of signing, they just throw sandals

582
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,580
 at each other or something.

583
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,420
 I don't know.

584
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,100
 That was, it's official.

585
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,720
 I threw my sandal at you.

586
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,300
 And so Boaz becomes the redeemer for Ruth and Naomi.

587
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:06,340
 Let's give a hand.

588
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,340
 Yeah.

589
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
 (audience applauding)

590
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,300
 She's redeemed.

591
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,140
 And we see in these times of judges,

592
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,640
 you know, this whole story,

593
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,600
 the famine that came, the tragedy that struck,

594
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,120
 the faith that awakens, the hope that comes

595
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,020
 when they meet Boaz, the return of Ruth

596
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:32,420
 as she goes and sort of proposes.

597
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,300
 And then the rise of the redeemer.

598
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,100
 And it all leads towards this one last thing.

599
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,860
 The last redeemer.

600
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,940
 The last redeemer.

601
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,140
 JP's loving it.

602
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,940
 JP's loving it.

603
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,660
 Let's read together.

604
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,820
 So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife.

605
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,700
 When he made love to her, the Lord enabled her to conceive,

606
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,220
 and she gave birth to a son.

607
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,820
 The woman said to Naomi, praise be to the Lord

608
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:10,740
 who this day has not left you without a guardian redeemer.

609
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,220
 May he become famous throughout Israel.

610
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,500
 He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age

611
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,660
 for your daughter-in-law who loves you

612
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,660
 and who is better to you than seven sons has given birth.

613
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:31,040
 Then Naomi took the child into her arms and cared for him.

614
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,180
 The woman living there said, Naomi has a son.

615
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,580
 And they named him Obed.

616
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:43,580
 And he was the father of Jesse and the father of David.

617
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,860
 Wow.

618
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,940
 Isn't that amazing?

619
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,340
 The first thing that's amazing

620
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:56,700
 is that God uses a Moabite woman

621
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:00,000
 to accomplish his plan.

622
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 A widow, poor, looked down upon in society.

623
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,880
 And God uses her to accomplish his plan.

624
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,360
 And what is his plan?

625
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,440
 His plan was not just for us to be redeemed

626
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,200
 in our poor situation,

627
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,040
 in our tough trials,

628
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,520
 but God's plan was for us to be redeemed.

629
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:41,520
 And God's plan was for us to be redeemed.

630
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:47,520
 And God's plan was for us to be redeemed.

631
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,520
 And God's plan was for us to be redeemed.

632
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,520
 And God's plan was for us to be redeemed.

633
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,000
 He sustains the world.

634
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,440
 And he had in mind that this Moabite woman

635
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,520
 would be part of God's overarching plan

636
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,680
 for the redemption of mankind.

637
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:23,320
 And we know God made a covenant with David

638
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,760
 that his descendant would be on the throne forever.

639
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,080
 His throne would be established forever.

640
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,440
 And that was accomplished by the last redeemer.

641
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,360
 The redeemer that we need, who saves us.

642
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,960
 God has a plan.

643
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,800
 This story started with death and tragedy.

644
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,200
 And it ended with life and birth.

645
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,800
 It was empty hopelessness.

646
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,080
 And it turned full and hopeful.

647
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,120
 Naomi thought she was going back to die.

648
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,200
 That God gave her new hope.

649
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,600
 And this last redeemer

650
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,680
 doesn't just redeem us from our poor situation

651
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,520
 or whatever trials we go through.

652
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,400
 He redeems us from spiritual death to spiritual life.

653
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,920
 From sin and slavery to becoming slaves of righteousness.

654
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,800
 From spiritually poor to now we are spiritually rich.

655
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,480
 Because we share in the inheritance with Jesus Christ.

656
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,080
 What an amazing father.

657
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,960
 God is an amazing father.

658
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,720
 His plan for us is amazing.

659
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,400
 It's Father's Day.

660
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,000
 And I wanna talk about my father.

661
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,880
 My father is a pastor in Toronto.

662
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,520
 He's a good friend of Pastor Lamb.

663
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,160
 That's how we met.

664
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:17,240
 And that's how I came to be here.

665
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,240
 My dad is an amazing person.

666
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,920
 He's so disciplined.

667
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,320
 He runs every morning.

668
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,840
 He's super disciplined.

669
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,960
 He's so passionate in sharing the gospel.

670
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,960
 He's so hardworking.

671
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,680
 But what I love most about my father

672
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,880
 is that he is always there for me when I need it the most.

673
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,000
 In the darkest of times when I went through

674
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,080
 some big trials and struggles on my own,

675
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:57,040
 he embraced me in his arms.

676
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,440
 In the midst of really hard times

677
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,440
 and maybe even some mistakes I made,

678
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,080
 he stood up for me.

679
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,160
 He was there.

680
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,680
 He was there for me.

681
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,280
 He was there for me.

682
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,280
 Always dependable, always there.

683
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,200
 A man of his word.

684
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,280
 I'm blessed to have a father like him.

685
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:40,000
 And maybe all of us don't have such a father,

686
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,760
 but let me tell you something.

687
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,840
 There are people in this congregation

688
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,760
 that love you, that care about you,

689
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,200
 and are there for you.

690
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,200
 And we, we are here for you.

691
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,080
 And we can only do what God allows us to do

692
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,720
 to the best of our ability.

693
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:12,040
 And so I wanna conclude with these three things

694
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,320
 that God really wants us to work on.

695
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,640
 God uses all people.

696
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,640
 Jew, Gentile, women, men, widows, rich.

697
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,320
 God uses all people.

698
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,360
 And we need to find our identity in him.

699
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,360
 Not in what the world says,

700
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,040
 not in what the world says we should be

701
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,920
 or could be or shouldn't be.

702
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,480
 We need to find our identity in Christ.

703
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,080
 We need to have faith in his plan.

704
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,040
 Do you have faith in God's plan?

705
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,600
 Do you have faith in God's plan?

706
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:59,680
 That not only does he want what's best for you,

707
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,000
 but he wants to save you for eternity.

708
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,240
 He wants to save you for eternity.

709
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,360
 You know, this life, it's temporary.

710
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,360
 This world has been corrupted by sin.

711
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,280
 But God's plan is that one day in eternity,

712
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,520
 we will be with him forever.

713
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,160
 That is his plan, and that is our hope.

714
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,240
 And during this time when we trust Jesus

715
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,800
 and we ask him into our life,

716
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,560
 he's working on our character

717
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,000
 so that we can become more like him.

718
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,080
 More like Ruth and her trust in a God that is unknown.

719
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,960
 Her hardworking attitude,

720
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,200
 laying herself down like a servant.

721
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,200
 Boaz, Joe, who is generous, upright.

722
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,440
 God wants to build our character

723
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,400
 to become more like Jesus, more like him.

724
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,280
 Let's close our eyes as the band comes up.

725
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,880
 And we're gonna sing this song.

726
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,160
 It's called "Good, Good Father."

727
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,560
 Oh, not "Good, Good Father."

728
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:25,760
 The goodness of God.

729
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,440
 Very good song.

730
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,280
 And as we sing it,

731
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,800
 let's be reminded that God is here for us.

732
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,040
 No matter what circumstance we are.

733
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,320
 In poorness, in rich, in trial, in blessing,

734
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,160
 God is here.

735
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,880
 Trust him that he has a plan.

736
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,600
 That he is good.

737
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,840
 Let's stand and worship together.

738
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,260
 together.
