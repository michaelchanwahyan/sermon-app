[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.960]   I have the privilege of sharing the Word of God
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.880]   with you today, feeling a little bit insecure
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.160]   because the speaker from last week ended with a rap
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.960]   and I am not gonna be able to do that
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.720]   and she has some self-designed slides
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.620]   and mine are gonna be just black on white,
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.920]   so feeling very insecure right now,
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.920]   but praying that actually as we go through this chapter
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.680]   of 2 Timothy 3, that the Lord will be able
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.920]   to open up to you something.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.320]   I mean, that was a tough chapter to read, wasn't it?
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.440]   If you have a look at what Paul was saying to Timothy,
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.800]   it wasn't good.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.800]   That first verse really hits you, but understand this.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.960]   Understand this, in the last days
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.680]   there will be times of difficulty.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.880]   And we just really appreciate the heart
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.640]   behind what Paul is saying here.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.000]   So as Johnny told us a couple weeks back,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.720]   2 Timothy 3 was Paul's last letter.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.960]   He's writing it in prison.
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.520]   He knows that this time he won't get out.
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.680]   This will be the last time.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.680]   And so can you just imagine just for a second,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.360]   as he's writing this in this prison cell,
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.760]   knowing that he won't be going out,
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.760]   this will be the last thing that he writes to Timothy.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.200]   And this is the most important thing
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.880]   he wants Timothy to remember.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.860]   Think about the book of John, chapter 14 to 17.
[00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.800]   Chapter 13 is the Last Supper,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.140]   and then we head into the last few chapters
[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.360]   where Jesus heads into this monologue.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.600]   He starts John 14 saying,
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.960]   "I'm the way, the truth, and the life."
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.280]   And then he ends up with John 17 with his last prayer.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.920]   It's kind of like his last bit saying,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.880]   "If you forget everything else,
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.040]   "if you forget everything I've taught you
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.720]   "these last three years, remember this."
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.320]   And so Paul writes with that same heart.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.360]   He's telling Timothy, "I'm gonna be gone soon.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.240]   "I know that I won't get out this time.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.000]   "And I know that you're gonna be on your own from here.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.560]   "And so therefore I want you to remember this."
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.240]   And so understand this.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.000]   Don't just know it, but understand it deep in your heart
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.400]   that the last days are coming
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.580]   and they are going to be hard.
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.360]   The last days represents this period
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.240]   from the moment Jesus leaves and heads to heaven
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.560]   and basically all this time now until he returns.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.760]   The apostle Peter talks about this in Acts 2
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.920]   where he's prophesying, quoting Joel.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.680]   And he's saying, "In the last days,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.360]   "young men will dream dreams."
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.120]   And so we are in the last days right now
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.120]   and Paul is telling Timothy and we are being told
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.720]   that in these last days, times will be hard.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.680]   Now we don't really need reminding of that.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.500]   We just need to switch on the news.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.360]   We just need to go to Fox News, SCMP, the BBC,
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.280]   and we will see that the times are not the easiest, right?
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.220]   But here's the thing.
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.220]   Every time we look at something that isn't good news,
[00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.320]   don't we still have that same sense of shock,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.380]   that same sense of, "Oh, wow, bad things are happening.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.560]   "They shouldn't be, they shouldn't be."
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.040]   Or every time something bad happens to us,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.840]   we sometimes still have this, right?
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.480]   We have this anger and frustration,
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.280]   like, "Oh, this shouldn't be happening to us.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.280]   "We're Christians.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.220]   "Actually, God promised that he'll bless us
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.840]   "and my life will be smooth from now.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.060]   "Why is my life not smooth?
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.240]   "Did I do something wrong?"
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.280]   But you see, that is against what the Bible teaches.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.980]   Scripture says, "In the last days,
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.180]   "the times will be difficult."
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.420]   Peter talks about this in 1 Peter 4, saying,
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.520]   "Don't be surprised when you face fiery trials."
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.720]   Jesus says in John 16, "In this world, you will have," what?
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.200]   "Trouble, but take heart, I have overcome the world."
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.760]   So for us as believers, we've got to get into that mindset.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.400]   Every time something goes wrong,
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.820]   rather than doubting God and saying,
[00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.760]   "Oh, God, why is there suffering if there is a God?
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.440]   "Why isn't my God making my life as smooth as possible?"
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.900]   Recognise that that's never what he promised.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.020]   But of course, also recognise that any of the tough times
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.580]   that we're going through right now as Christians
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.500]   don't quite compare to what they were going through.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.540]   It doesn't quite compare to the persecution
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.260]   that was happening to the early church.
[00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.220]   We gathered here today quite freely.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.540]   We drove here or caught the MTR or caught the bus here,
[00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.660]   walked into Admiralty,
[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.580]   strolled up into Firey's Finance Centre,
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.740]   and came in feeling relatively at peace
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.540]   that we're allowed to gather here,
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.900]   that we are going to be safe
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.220]   in opening the Word of God together,
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.900]   that we're going to be okay in singing,
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.000]   we're going to be okay in praying.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.860]   So we may have troubles,
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.780]   and who knows what the future holds,
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.780]   but this is not what they were going through.
[00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.260]   And you see, Paul is making it very obvious to Timothy,
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.360]   he's saying, "Hey, understand this.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.860]   "I'm not going to be around, so I need you to remember this.
[00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.660]   "It's going to be hard.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.500]   "It's going to be hard."
[00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.780]   And in this chapter, he really,
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.700]   we can break it down into three different parts,
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.940]   and he talks about three things.
[00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.180]   He talks about the problem in the future.
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.260]   He's saying, "I'm not going to be there
[00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.800]   "to walk with you, Timothy, so I want to warn you
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.100]   "and prepare you for the problem that is in the future.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.360]   "Then I want to tell you that the answer to that problem
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.060]   "is in the past.
[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.820]   "And finally, I want to tell you
[00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.580]   "that I want to charge you for the present.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.660]   "I want to remind you what you should be doing now."
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.100]   So the problem in the future, the answer is in the past,
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.620]   and the charge for the present
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.660]   is what we're going to be going through.
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.780]   And the first one is this.
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.820]   What is the problem in the future?
[00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.700]   The problem, of course, is godlessness.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.700]   The title of this passage is "Godlessness in the Last Days."
[00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.700]   And Alex just read out, and it was a mouthful,
[00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.700]   18 characteristics of what the world was going to be like.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.380]   Essentially, he was describing what the world is right now.
[00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.220]   Lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive,
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.780]   disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.180]   And he goes through this whole list.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.540]   He's saying, "The times are going to be difficult.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.380]   "Why?
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.700]   "Because all these things are going to be present.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.380]   "There is going to be so much godlessness in the last days,
[00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.820]   "and we're not going to be able to go through
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.540]   "each and every one today."
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.980]   But I want to just highlight something.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.180]   This passage that talks about this
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.660]   really can be split into two.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.540]   What is godlessness, or rather, what is godlessness,
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.780]   and how is it described by Paul in this short passage?
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.660]   And I can split it into two parts very generally.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.260]   And one is that he talks about this misdirected love,
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.980]   this misdirected love that appears
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.700]   when there is a godless culture.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.900]   And two, this misleading look that you can have.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.100]   So I want to go through each of these.
[00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.740]   And so the first one is this idea of misdirected love.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.580]   If you look at this whole passage of all these things,
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.580]   in its literary form, it's actually bookended by loves.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.660]   So it's the lover of self, it's the lover of money,
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.220]   and at the very end of the list,
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.180]   it's lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.420]   So this whole list really comes down
[00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.220]   to this concept of misdirected love.
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.820]   What do I mean by that?
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.540]   God tells us to love Him
[00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.740]   with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.100]   He said, "Don't love anything else to that same level."
[00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.940]   Why?
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.780]   Because if you love anything else, it has the potential,
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.220]   it has the power to corrupt you.
[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.500]   It has the power to be destructive,
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.180]   even if it is a good thing.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.060]   Of course, it starts off with the first one saying,
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.140]   lover of self, lover of money.
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.540]   Again, we've talked about this before,
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.780]   this issue in this society, this godless society
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.460]   that loves money, sex, and power.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.420]   And He's saying, if you love any of those things,
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.140]   they have the power to corrupt you,
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.100]   they have the power to destroy you.
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.260]   You see, we are all built to love.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.340]   We can't help it.
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.780]   Even those who aren't very romantic,
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.300]   we are built to love, we are built to worship something.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.900]   The only question here is, what are you loving?
[00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.940]   What are you worshipping?
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.660]   You see, when it is the wrong thing,
[00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.700]   when it is a misdirected kind of love,
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.060]   then it becomes, then you're leading on a path
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.660]   towards godlessness.
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.500]   Why?
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.780]   If we just summarise those misdirected loves
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.260]   into those three general things, money, sex, and power,
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.660]   what do they all really represent?
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.100]   What are you actually loving
[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.540]   when you love those three things?
[00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.580]   What causes you to be proud, to be unholy,
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.340]   to be disobedient to your parents?
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.980]   Our love of money, sex, and power, why is it problematic?
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.740]   Because all of those loves
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.620]   really reflect this desire to be in control.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.100]   You love money because you wanna be in control
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:11.660]   of your own life.
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.380]   You wanna be able to do whatever you want to do.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.220]   You wanna have control over the people
[00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:17.940]   in whatever way you want to.
[00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.740]   That's the love of power as well.
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.220]   The love of sex, this love of pleasure
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.220]   that's talked about again, it's about you
[00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.780]   wanting to assume and maintain and hold onto control.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.060]   Our love for control is this misdirected love
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.700]   where God's saying, "No."
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.420]   Well, one, you recognise that you will never truly be
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.060]   in control, but he says, "Look at me, love me.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.740]   "I'm the only one that won't corrupt you.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.860]   "I am the only one who will complete you."
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:46.940]   So don't have this misdirected kind of love
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:50.060]   because when you love control,
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.820]   you're basically saying, "I want to be God."
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.700]   So then there's no surprise, the result is godlessness.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.780]   Do we get that?
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.780]   When you love control and love all these things,
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:05.860]   you're basically saying that, "I want to be God."
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.260]   And so therefore, it's no surprise when our lives
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.980]   or when our society is filled with godlessness.
[00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.740]   So that's the first one, misdirected love.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.300]   And the second one is this, and it carries on, verse five,
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.180]   "Having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power."
[00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.220]   Having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power.
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.100]   He's looking at people in the church and he's going,
[00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.380]   "Some people here look holy.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.020]   "Some people here look righteous.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.180]   "Some people here look like leaders of the church,
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.020]   "but they are denying its power.
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.140]   "They are not really living by the power of God.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.340]   "They are not really living by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.860]   "even though they look like they're ticking all the boxes."
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.340]   Now this one hurts because I wonder how many of us here
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.660]   are committed to maintaining an appearance of godliness,
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.940]   myself included.
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.340]   But how many of us here are actually still denying its power?
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.180]   How many of us here are continually learning?
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.660]   I think it was verse seven,
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.740]   "Always learning, but never able to arrive at the truth."
[00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.740]   He's saying there's a group of people in the church
[00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.500]   right then and right now who are so committed to learning
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.420]   and filling their heads with knowledge
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.740]   that it never drops into their hearts
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.420]   and then never impacts the way they live.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.540]   So they're denying the power of truth.
[00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.380]   They never arrive at that knowledge of truth.
[00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:26.460]   They're always just learning
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.020]   and filling, filling their heads up.
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.700]   And it's misleading.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.580]   It's a misleading look.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.460]   It's hypocrisy.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.500]   When people are committed to only cleaning the cup
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.980]   on the outside, but the inside is completely dirty.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.580]   That's what Jesus talked about, right?
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.620]   And this is what Paul's saying.
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.900]   He's saying there are this group of people
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:45.740]   that are doing that,
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.540]   that not only have they misdirected their love,
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.740]   they are also misleading other people.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.340]   And he talks about a group of people
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.780]   and he's referring to a group of people
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.620]   who are going to influence, going into people's homes,
[00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.660]   especially women's homes and misleading them
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.820]   and teaching them and leading them astray.
[00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.420]   You've got to recognise at that point
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.660]   in culture and time, women weren't allowed to learn.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.700]   So Christianity was a huge, radical, revolutionary thing
[00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.340]   where women were finally able to learn
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.140]   and they were keen and they were wanting to,
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.220]   but there were a group of people
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.500]   who were manipulating that and leading them astray.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.620]   And Paul's saying, what does he say about those people?
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.260]   Avoid them.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:22.180]   Avoid them.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.260]   Have nothing to do with them.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.740]   Kick them out of your church is actually what he's saying.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.780]   Don't let them be members of your body
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.580]   because if that body gets corrupted,
[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.540]   it won't be able to go anywhere.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.980]   So that is the problem that you're going to face
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.020]   in the future, that you will have these people
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.660]   who are misleading and who are misdirected in their love.
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.820]   Just as Janus and Jambres opposed Moses,
[00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.340]   so these men also opposed the truth.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.740]   And he refers to these two people
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.860]   who aren't actually referenced anywhere else in the Bible,
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.340]   but what he's referring to is the scene in Exodus 7
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.100]   where the miracles are happening,
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.420]   when Moses is trying to save the people,
[00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:57.660]   the Israelites, out of Egypt.
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.220]   And so all these miracles are happening.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.100]   And then these two magicians
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:05.180]   who were trying to basically replicate what Moses is doing.
[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.420]   And actually they succeed to a certain level.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.140]   They managed to, through trickery, through magic,
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.060]   managed to get some tricks to happen.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.420]   Counterfeiting miracles is what happens with these two guys.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.220]   But Paul's saying, but eventually they will not get very far
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.100]   and their folly will be plain to his men.
[00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.180]   You see, here's the problem.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.860]   Sometimes we follow things that look good.
[00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.140]   Sometimes we place our love into things
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.260]   that aren't really good.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.100]   Why?
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.100]   Because they will hold these promises
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.940]   that they will satisfy us.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:33.940]   They will hold these promises.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.740]   Hey, if you follow me, if you look, look at this,
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.540]   look how beautiful it looks.
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.140]   Look how much you will be loved if you take this on.
[00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.340]   If you take this job or if you find this partner
[00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.060]   or if you pursue, if you buy this thing, if you buy that.
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.740]   But you see, that's the problem.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.380]   And then we realise that actually that we've been misled.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.460]   And so the question for us,
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.220]   as we think about this problem in the future,
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.660]   which is the problem for us right now,
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:01.580]   is are there loves that we have placed on things
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.700]   that actually shouldn't really be there?
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.060]   Have we misplaced our love?
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.220]   Have a think about that.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.580]   Have we loved the wrong thing?
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.260]   And also have we put our trust and faith in people
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.340]   who actually may be misleading us?
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:18.940]   And this one requires such discernment for us
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.020]   as we think about, as we approach people,
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.460]   as we look at church leaders,
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.660]   as we look at pastors who are sharing the word of God,
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.780]   man, is this person sticking to the truth?
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:31.300]   Is this person sticking to the truth?
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.580]   There's this quote that the enemy didn't force Adam and Eve
[00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.620]   to lie and to disobey God.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.660]   What did they do?
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.740]   The enemy basically just asked the Adam and Eve
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.740]   to mistrust what God said, distort the truth of God.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.420]   And that's a question that we have to ask ourselves.
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:52.620]   Are we sticking to the truth?
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.420]   Because that is the way that we're gonna be able
[00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:55.860]   to answer the problems.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.340]   So that's the first one really.
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.580]   The problem in the future is godlessness.
[00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.540]   The answer is from the past.
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.780]   And what is that answer?
[00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.060]   That answer is godliness.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:08.060]   So he comes up with this whole list of bad things.
[00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.020]   And he's saying, "Hey, avoid such people."
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.020]   And then he looks at Timothy and then he goes,
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:16.420]   "You, however, you don't do that."
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.380]   He calls him out and sets him apart and says,
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.820]   "You, on the other hand, won't do that, can't do that.
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.660]   "Why?"
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:24.940]   And then he lists these things
[00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.660]   that Timothy himself has done.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.180]   He says, "You, however, have followed my teaching,
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.460]   "my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience,
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:36.340]   "my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions and sufferings."
[00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.260]   So he goes through this list.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:42.020]   He says, "You, Timothy, don't do these things.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.060]   "Why?
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:44.900]   "Because you know better.
[00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.900]   "Why?
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.540]   "Because you followed my teaching.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.620]   "You followed my conduct, my aim in life, my faith,
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.460]   "my patience, my love, my steadfastness."
[00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.580]   Isn't this interesting?
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.980]   He lists these six virtues out and says to Timothy,
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.860]   "You, however, don't do those things
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.220]   "because you've seen how I live."
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.060]   And he lists these things out.
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.580]   And the first one is teaching.
[00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.820]   And he says, "Hey, you know what I've taught.
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.140]   "You know the doctrine, but that's the only one
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.340]   "that really is about teaching.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.180]   "What are all the other ones?
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.300]   "All the other ones are about life, are about conduct."
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.860]   You see, sometimes I think we just stop at teaching.
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.140]   We come into church and we think,
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.060]   "We are just gonna download information.
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.100]   "We listen to podcasts, and we're just gonna keep them
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.820]   "in our heads, and we're gonna leave them there
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.220]   "until our heads explode and they don't go anywhere."
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.180]   But Paul's saying that it's a part of it.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.140]   It's an important part.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:35.980]   It's the first part.
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.060]   It's the first thing on the list,
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.020]   but it's not the only thing.
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.660]   In fact, there are all these other things.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:44.180]   "My teaching leads to my conduct, leads to my aim in life,
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.220]   "leads to my love, leads to my patience."
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.860]   He's saying, "You've watched me live."
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.020]   The passage that Mo shared on last week,
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.940]   2 Timothy 2, talks about this.
[00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:58.060]   2 chapter 2, verse 2, "And what you have heard from me
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.740]   "in the presence of many witnesses, entrust to faithful men
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.460]   "who will also be able to teach others."
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.460]   He's saying, "You've seen how I live.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.500]   "You've been taught by me, and now I need you
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.540]   "to live it out and pass it on to other people."
[00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:16.540]   So with godlessness, that is the answer to,
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.620]   sorry, godliness is the answer to godlessness.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.900]   But what does actually godliness look like?
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.220]   So if godlessness is misdirected love
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.580]   and it's misleading luck,
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.580]   godliness is intentionally lived and also intensely tested.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.540]   And he starts with this, and as I just said,
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.500]   he goes through this whole list, and he's saying,
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.260]   "These are the things, you know what godliness is
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.860]   "because it's my teaching, it's my conduct,
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.500]   "it's my aim in life, it's my faith, my patience,
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.180]   "my love, my steadfastness."
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.020]   It is intentionally lived out.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.260]   That is godliness.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.660]   It's not just in the head.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.540]   It is not just how many Bible verses you remember.
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.380]   It isn't how many Christian-y quotes you can memorise.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.300]   Rather, it is intentionally lived out.
[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.780]   It is modelled.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.660]   And so the question for us is, do we model that godliness?
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.900]   We may have lots of Bible knowledge.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.860]   We may be able to quote and retell
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.060]   Old Testament stories to kids, but do we live it out?
[00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:20.780]   Do we live it out?
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:24.900]   Is someone able to learn about God through the way we live?
[00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.500]   Do we intentionally live it out?
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.460]   Sometimes I look and I think about the people
[00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.260]   that I've followed, the mentors that I've had,
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.940]   and I'm like, "Man, I've taken some of their mannerisms.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.620]   "I've learned how, actually, when I walk into a room
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.940]   "and I talk to people, I'm reminded
[00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.700]   "that's how my mentor used to talk to people."
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.860]   And I realise I've inherited some of his jokes
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:49.020]   and some of his bad sense of humour, and it's all there,
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.220]   but it's because I watched it.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.260]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.780]   And it's a thing.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.620]   But that's the thing.
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.140]   That's what Paul says that we should be doing.
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.060]   He's saying that, actually, not only should we look
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.140]   to have people to follow, we should also be
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.260]   the kind of person that other people follow.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.540]   So there's actually two questions there.
[00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.380]   Maybe I'm cheating.
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.620]   The first question is this.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.980]   Do you have anyone that you're following?
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.260]   You see, and actually, we hear this a lot.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.660]   "Oh, I don't really have any mentors.
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:18.380]   "I don't have someone to kind of lead me in the right way."
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.940]   But you see, even when it comes to that,
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:23.700]   it needs a certain level of intentionality.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.060]   So actually, for you, I encourage you, have a think.
[00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.860]   Are there people in your life,
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.740]   they don't have to necessarily be older than you,
[00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.500]   but just people that you look up to spiritually,
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.660]   or just in the way that they live,
[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.860]   or maybe the way they parent,
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.500]   or the way that they go about their work?
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:40.940]   My encouragement to you is find those people,
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:44.220]   and then say, "Hey, I'd like to get to know you.
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.420]   "I'd like to get to understand why you are the way you are,
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.580]   "because I want to be a little bit like you."
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:54.020]   I had an experience of this this week.
[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.940]   There's been someone who supports our mission
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:57.900]   to go and meet young people,
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.820]   and I was just having lunch with him,
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.780]   and I just couldn't help but ask him questions,
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.460]   because there's something about him.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.020]   Now, he's very, very successful in his work,
[00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.780]   in his field of work, but yet,
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.500]   he takes his faith so, so seriously.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.660]   I was like, "There's something about you
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:15.180]   "that I can't quite put a nail on it, finger on it,
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.860]   "but I want to know more about it.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.740]   "I want to go to wherever you're going.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.500]   "I want to talk to whoever you're talking to.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.140]   "I want to be with you when you're discipling,
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:25.980]   "because there's something about you that I want to learn."
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.140]   So that's my first question.
[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:28.980]   Are there any people like that in your life?
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:31.260]   There really should be.
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.740]   There really should be.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.660]   Of course, we have to recognise that person
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.820]   is not a perfect person,
[00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:39.620]   but there's something that you can learn from that person.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.940]   You see, the moment that we stop feeling
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.260]   as though we need to grow,
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:44.740]   the moment that we feel as though
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.100]   we are already at the top of our ladder,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.580]   that's when we know that there's a problem,
[00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.020]   that we realise that we've always been learning,
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.500]   but we've not arrived yet at this knowledge of truth.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.340]   So that's number one.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.500]   And the second is then, as you look at your life,
[00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.180]   is your life worth following?
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.060]   You see, Paul, in these six virtues,
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.700]   basically summarises his life.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.500]   Can you imagine just Paul's mindset?
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.580]   He's just about to die.
[00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:08.940]   He's just about to meet Jesus,
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.860]   and he summarises everything that he's done.
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.140]   His teaching, his aim in life,
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.700]   his love, his patience, his conduct,
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.140]   and he summarises it all.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.100]   I wonder whether we are able to summarise what we did,
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:22.300]   what we've done, the lives that we've lived.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.860]   Do we have people who look at us and go,
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.420]   "Oh, I want to follow you in that.
[00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.540]   "I love the way your kids have grown up.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.220]   "I'd love to follow you.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.100]   "I love the way that you approach and read the Word.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.260]   "I love the way you pray."
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.780]   Now, not to say that we just do it
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.100]   for those moments of affirmation,
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.140]   because then we would just be appearing godly,
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.780]   but are we genuinely both godly
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:50.220]   and also not denying the Holy Spirit working in us?
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:51.580]   Do we have those people?
[00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.860]   Because godliness is intentionally lived,
[00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:57.260]   but it's also intensely tested.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.180]   And this next passage here is the one
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.700]   that really should send shivers down our spines.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.100]   "Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.220]   "in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:12.020]   As I said, we in Hong Kong, right here, right now,
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.860]   are not going through the same persecution
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.180]   as Paul and Timothy are.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.020]   That's, they win, okay, in that sense.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:23.300]   But there comes another question.
[00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.740]   What does this verse mean?
[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.780]   "Indeed, those who desire to live a godly life
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.180]   "will face persecution."
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.660]   It leads me to another question in my mind is,
[00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.980]   does my faith cost me anything?
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:41.740]   For you, does you following in Jesus cost you anything?
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:47.740]   Just have to think about that for a second.
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:52.020]   Does it cost you to not have your own way in any scenario?
[00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.580]   Does it cost you when it comes to a certain promotion
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.180]   because you have to act a certain way?
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.380]   Does it cost you in something?
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.460]   Because here's the thing,
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.940]   I think if your faith in God doesn't cost you anything,
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.260]   I don't know whether it's worth anything.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:12.540]   Can I say that again?
[00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:15.940]   If our faith in Jesus doesn't cost us something,
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:19.140]   I don't know if it's worth anything.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.180]   I don't know if it's worth that much
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:26.380]   because godliness is intensely tested.
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.740]   There must be something about us following,
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.860]   declaring to follow this Jesus, this saviour,
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.820]   who ended up dying on a cross, by the way.
[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:35.740]   So we shouldn't just expect prosperity
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.940]   and blessings from him because clearly,
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:39.620]   the man that we profess to follow
[00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.220]   did not end up with a big mansion,
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.540]   at least not here on earth.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.220]   But if godliness is to be strived for,
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.980]   then it must cost something.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.940]   And so the question for us is,
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:54.380]   do we ever put ourselves in a position
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:56.100]   where we surrender that control?
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.100]   We're back to control again.
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.740]   Where we get to that point where we're like,
[00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.820]   okay God, you're real, you're good,
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.060]   and because of that, I'm gonna let go.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.700]   I know it's gonna cost me something,
[00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.500]   but I count everything else as loss
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.580]   in comparison to knowing you.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:14.380]   Do we have that kind of heart
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.860]   when it comes to pursuing godliness?
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.740]   Because it must cost us something.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:23.820]   Because a lot of the times, what we try and do,
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.660]   we try and be the best Christians we can be
[00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.580]   whilst being the best bankers
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.500]   or the best lawyers or the best teachers.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.140]   We try and just blend into society.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.260]   Sometimes I try and convince people,
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.460]   I say, "Hey, I'm a Christian,
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.500]   "but before you leave, I'm not weird."
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.220]   Especially, you know what?
[00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:40.380]   Many, many pastors say this.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.100]   Whenever we go and meet new people,
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.500]   it's almost the question that stops,
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.180]   the word that stops any kind of conversation.
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.820]   They ask, "Oh, I'm James."
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.660]   "Oh, what do you do?"
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.780]   "Well, I'm a pastor."
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.100]   And suddenly, everyone else is like,
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.540]   "Oh, you're a pastor."
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.380]   Like, okay, I'm not gonna talk to you.
[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.980]   Put your Bible away.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.620]   And then I'm like, "No, no, no, I'm really cool.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.700]   "Seriously, talk to me.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.540]   "I'm really funny.
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:01.540]   "Keep talking to me.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.500]   "I'm actually quite a normal person."
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.580]   And in our desire to fit in,
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.540]   to be loved and to be accepted,
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:14.860]   we end up compromising on what the gospel truly is about.
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.340]   That we have also been looked at by Jesus saying,
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.140]   "You, however, are different.
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.580]   "You may be in this world, but you are not of this world.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:29.500]   "If you want to follow me, you have to die to yourself
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.500]   "and carry your cross and follow me.
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.140]   "It has to cost you something
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.020]   "because it cost me everything."
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:41.500]   This was the argument that I was having with Jesus
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.940]   when I was wrestling with him about coming to Hong Kong.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.620]   I'm like, "And I've shared this before.
[00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.420]   "Do you understand all the things
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.260]   "I'm gonna have to let go of
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.900]   "in order to follow you to this crazy city
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.020]   "across the other side of the world?
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.380]   "Do you understand everything that,
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.020]   "I'm gonna have to do all these things?"
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.700]   And then the Lord spoke so clearly to me.
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.900]   He says, "Yes, I understand.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.140]   "I know, my child.
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.460]   "But do you recognise what I gave for you?"
[00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.740]   And you see, sometimes we are trapped in that.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:08.940]   It's like, "Oh, I wanna follow you, God.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.180]   "I wanna be godly,
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.060]   "but what's the cheapest deal
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:15.820]   "that I can obtain to be godly?
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.540]   "Is there some kind of discount that I can get?
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.740]   "Is there some kind of voucher code I can get
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.860]   "where I can still be wholesome and godly,
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.500]   "but it doesn't cost me anything?
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.100]   "Can I find that deal?"
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.540]   But here, Paul says in verse 12,
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:35.460]   "Indeed, those who desire to live a godly life
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.380]   "will be persecuted."
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.660]   Maybe not in the same way that they were being persecuted,
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:42.060]   but it's got a cost to something.
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:42.980]   Do you get that?
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:44.180]   It's got a cost to something.
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:46.220]   Our faith has to be tested.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.140]   It has to be tested.
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.540]   Godliness has to be intensely tested.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.980]   So the problem in the future,
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:55.820]   the answer is in the past,
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.980]   in terms of the time that he spent with Paul.
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.900]   That's his answer.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.220]   The godliness is, "Hey, you saw me live out
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.180]   "this godly life.
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.780]   "Remember it, especially when you're facing
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.620]   "these difficult times and I'm not around anymore.
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.940]   "Would you just remember?"
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.460]   He reminds him, "Hey, Timothy, do you remember that time
[00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:14.980]   "we were in Iconium?
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.380]   "Do you remember that time I was in Lystra?
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.820]   "Do you remember that time where you were with me
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.540]   "in these places in Antioch?
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:21.580]   "Do you remember?
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.260]   "When you go through your own stuff,"
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.540]   and every parent will have this,
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:28.500]   "Child, when you go through your own troubles,
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.340]   "remember the time that you spent with me in those places.
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:34.300]   "Remember what I was like.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.500]   "The answer, your answer to the future
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.500]   "will be in your past with me.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.220]   "And remember that.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.380]   "Remember how I taught you.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:43.700]   "Remember how I lived out my life.
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.940]   "Remember what the purpose of my life was.
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.660]   "Remember the love and the patience I had
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.300]   "even when I was beat down and persecuted in prison.
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.900]   "Remember, remember."
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.900]   And so we've talked about the future,
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.140]   we've talked about looking back,
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.020]   and finally, the charge for the present.
[00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.700]   And the charge here is this, to continue.
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.660]   Who's good at starting things,
[00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.220]   but not very good at finishing things or sustaining things?
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.820]   Paul's charge here at the very end is continue.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.860]   Continue in what?
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.340]   Continue in the truth.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:17.900]   In the midst of all this persecution,
[00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:20.700]   the way you avoid godlessness
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:24.020]   and the way you achieve godliness
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.820]   is by sticking to the truth.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.700]   Remember, the enemy didn't force Adam and Eve to lie,
[00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:34.460]   but he tempted them to question the word of God.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.180]   Did he really say that to you?
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:43.700]   Are you really that loved?
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:47.700]   Can you really trust in God?
[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.140]   Or actually, should you try and fight
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.260]   for this promotion yourself?
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.180]   Should you engage in these office politics
[00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.300]   to try and manoeuvre your way to get a better life?
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:05.340]   The enemy tempts us to basically question the word of God.
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.540]   His tactics have not changed after all these years.
[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:10.540]   So Paul's charge to Timothy is what?
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.860]   To continue in the truth.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.300]   And he's saying, you're gonna face so many things
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.380]   that you don't know,
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.140]   but let what you know inform what you don't know.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.660]   You're gonna face so many scenarios
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.580]   where there are completely unprecedented
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.820]   and filled with trouble.
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.460]   How are you gonna face those things?
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.220]   Let what you know from the word of God
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.260]   inform what you don't know.
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:40.020]   What you have here is not specific instructions
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.940]   in how you cope with an economic crisis.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.340]   There are no specific instructions here
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:47.620]   about how you cope with a social unrest
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.060]   that's happening just in front of you on your street.
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.980]   It just has no specific instructions
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.820]   about these things right now in 2021 in Hong Kong.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.820]   But what it does have is the values and the principles
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.380]   that have transcended time.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.980]   Do you recognise this book that you read,
[00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.180]   that we're reading here,
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.140]   transcends time to the point where
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:10.460]   people have been holding this book
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.700]   for thousands of thousands of years.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:15.300]   And it still remains relevant.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.700]   And Paul, what he says to Timothy here in chapter three,
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.100]   verses 14 to 16 is,
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.700]   "Remember what you have read and continue in this truth."
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.100]   And really he's asking him to remember two things,
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.380]   where you came from and where you're heading.
[00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:34.060]   And these final few verses show us this.
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.780]   And he's saying, if you're gonna keep
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.540]   to this very, very narrow path of godliness,
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:41.220]   you need to remember the truth.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.220]   And when he says that, he says,
[00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:45.220]   "Remember where you came from," verse 14 and 15, he says,
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.220]   "But as for you, continue in what you have learned
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.740]   "and firmly believe, knowing from who you have learned it."
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:51.060]   Whom did he learn it from?
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.340]   He learned it from Paul himself,
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.380]   because when he was a teenager,
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:56.660]   Paul met him in Leicester and said,
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.140]   "Hey, young man, you come with me
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.820]   "and I'm gonna teach you everything that I know," number one.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:03.380]   He also learned it from his grandmother, Lois,
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.300]   and from his mother, Eunice.
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.020]   And he's saying, when you face these problems in the future
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:09.380]   where the times will be difficult,
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.860]   I want you to remember me, your grandmother, and your mother.
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.820]   I want you to remember us,
[00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:18.700]   because you need to remember who you are.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.580]   You need to remember where you came from.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.620]   This was the identity crisis that Simba had
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.900]   in "The Lion King," when Rafiki hits him on the head.
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.540]   Do you remember?
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:30.820]   And then he hears his voice from heaven
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.980]   and that's where it gets really epic.
[00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.300]   He says, "Remember who you are.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:40.300]   "Look back at your past.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.980]   "Look back and remember all the things you learned."
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.980]   And I think probably someone needs to hear this today.
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.220]   Someone who has now reached,
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:49.740]   you may have reached this crossword
[00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.460]   where you are now in unprecedented territory.
[00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.260]   You are in completely new territory.
[00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:56.860]   Your parents are behind you.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.340]   Your future is ahead of you.
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.620]   But suddenly you're like, "Oh my goodness,
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.900]   "I have to make decisions on my own.
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.620]   "I have to face these troubles on my own.
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.020]   "This isn't like when I was a child,
[00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.020]   "when I was told exactly what to do and I would just do it."
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:12.060]   And Paul's saying, "Let that be the voice in your head.
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.140]   "Let my voice be the voice in your head.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.220]   "Remember what I taught you.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.540]   "Remember what your grandmother taught you.
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.380]   "Remember what your mother taught you.
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.300]   "And remember the sacred writings."
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.340]   Do we treat this book as sacred writings?
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.980]   Most of the time I just treat it as an app
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.180]   with a notification that is really annoying me
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.580]   'cause I know myself.
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.420]   So what do I do?
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.700]   I set myself reminders and notifications on my phone
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:36.180]   to read your Bible five times a day.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:37.340]   And each time I see it pop up, I'm like,
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.900]   "Oh, it's you again.
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.540]   "Just get rid of it."
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:42.820]   But these are sacred writings.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.020]   These have been passed on for thousands of years.
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.420]   These still remain to be true right now.
[00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.820]   And actually, one thing here to note,
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:52.820]   when Paul says to Timothy,
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.660]   "Remember what you learned from him.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:55.460]   "Remember the sacred writings."
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.460]   He's not talking about
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.340]   the lovey-dovey Romantic New Testament.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.980]   He's talking about Deuteronomy, Leviticus, numbers.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.380]   Ezekiel, Isaiah.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.220]   He's talking about the Old Testament.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.580]   And what is it about the Old Testament?
[00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.940]   What's the story of the Old Testament?
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.940]   If there's anything that Timothy needs to remember
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.180]   and learn from the Old Testament, what is it?
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.980]   It's about the depravity of man.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.420]   It's about the brokenness within us.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.260]   And it's about our dependence for God.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:30.260]   It's about the mistakes of man, but the grace of God.
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.980]   And he's saying, "Timothy, hold onto these truths.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.220]   "Hold onto these things,
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.140]   "because these are the ones that are gonna keep you
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.100]   "on the straight and narrow.
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:40.660]   "Continue in the truth.
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.660]   "The truth is the only thing that will set you free
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.260]   "from the times of difficulty that will come about."
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:51.020]   How much do we cling onto this truth here?
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.660]   How much do we recognise that this truly is the Word of God?
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.340]   And he finishes, and he talks about what Scripture is.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.700]   That Scripture is God-breathed.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.540]   That these are the very words of God.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:05.260]   And yet so often we just dismiss them,
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.420]   or we just remember soundbites just to keep us going.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:11.140]   Just for whatever circumstance we have.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.180]   We open the Bible up and go,
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.820]   "God, speak to me about my workplace.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.980]   "Speak to me about my relationship.
[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:16.900]   "Speak to me.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:19.460]   "Describe me again.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:20.300]   "Tell me about me."
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:24.700]   But no, do we recognise that we are part of this rich history
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:29.700]   and heritage of saints and sinners that have come before us?
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:33.620]   And do we treat this Word as sacred?
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.700]   Do we treat this Word as absolute truth?
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.500]   Because that's what we declare that we believe,
[00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.100]   but do we live it out?
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.100]   That's a question that we need to ask ourselves.
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.260]   And finally, because it teaches us where we're going.
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.660]   Because all Scripture is God-breathed.
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.020]   And in Hebrews 4 it says,
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.460]   "Scripture is living and active,
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.500]   "like a double-edged sword."
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:58.180]   And do we treat this Word of God like that?
[00:33:58.180 --> 00:33:59.620]   Because Paul's saying,
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.340]   "I charge you to continue in the truth."
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.580]   And there's two things that this truth will remind you.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.780]   One, it will make you wise for salvation.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.980]   Verse 15, "It will make you wise for salvation."
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.060]   What does that mean?
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:11.540]   It means that you will finally arrive
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.220]   at the knowledge of truth.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:16.220]   You will be instructed about how you get
[00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.580]   to be in eternity with the Lord.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.820]   It will tell you where you're heading.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:26.980]   And the second thing is that you will then be finally,
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:29.100]   oh, oh, it's not there.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.180]   It will finally, very, very, very final bit,
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.940]   that the man of God may be complete,
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.260]   equipped for every good work.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:39.180]   So one, the goal of remembering and clinging to the truth
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:41.260]   is that then you will be wise for salvation.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.020]   You will know that you are saved by Jesus,
[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.300]   and that is where you are heading.
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.300]   And also that you will be equipped for every good work.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.980]   You see, sometimes when we finally get it,
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:55.260]   when we finally get, ah, we are living for eternity,
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:57.620]   the things in this world won't matter.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.260]   I constantly have this friend in my head
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:01.700]   who's, again, very, very successful in his field.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.780]   And I was talking to him saying,
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.460]   "Hey, would you like to start a Bible study with this guy?
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.380]   "I know you're very busy.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.660]   "I know you've got tons of things on in your job,
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.900]   "and lots of responsibilities,
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.180]   "but would you like to have a breakfast Bible study
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.300]   "with me and this other guy?
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.420]   "'Cause I think it would be really good
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.140]   "just for us to just be and spend time
[00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.260]   "in the Word together."
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.700]   And he said this thing, and he's like,
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:25.300]   "James, my job won't really matter in eternity.
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.300]   "So absolutely, yes, because this is what matters."
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:31.580]   And so when we finally get to that point
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.620]   where we realise, man,
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:36.620]   eternity is so much bigger than I realised,
[00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:38.580]   that this world that I'm living right now,
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:41.580]   these few decades that I have here are so, so, so, so small,
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.540]   there is a temptation, there is a risk that isn't so good,
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.020]   is that we just keep our eyes completely focused on heaven,
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.580]   that we are now wise for salvation.
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.780]   We are up there in the clouds,
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.180]   and that's when people start thinking that we're weird
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.180]   because we don't want to have anything to do
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:35:59.020]   with this earth.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.940]   But that's the problem, right?
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.140]   That's the quote, right?
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.660]   Not only can we be heavenly-minded,
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.260]   but let's still be earthly good.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:09.020]   Let's still be equipped for every good work.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.660]   So that's the purpose of truth.
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.020]   To one, show us where we're going.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.620]   Let make us wise for salvation,
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.060]   but also still equip us.
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.340]   This book can equip us
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:24.140]   so that we can still be of earthly good.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:28.020]   The problem in the future,
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:31.380]   the problem right now is godlessness.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:33.940]   It's this desire to be God himself, to control.
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.540]   The answer is in the past.
[00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:42.860]   And the charge right now, in the present,
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.420]   is to continue in the truth.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.180]   How do we avoid godlessness?
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.420]   And how do we maintain hope in this godless world
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.700]   as we are surrounded just by terrible news?
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.060]   And how do we pursue godliness?
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.260]   And that's where my conclusion comes.
[00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.300]   If you're to remember one thing from this message,
[00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.380]   is how we are to respond and cope
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.260]   with the godlessness that surrounds us,
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.020]   we recognize that there is godlessness within us.
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.660]   I don't know how well you feel
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.820]   as being a human being right now.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.540]   I wonder whether you feel that you are
[00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.260]   a decent and a good Christian.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.580]   The heart of the gospel is to tell us that,
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.220]   no, actually, no one is good,
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.460]   at least to the level that the Lord requires.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.820]   And recognizing that there is godlessness
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:35.820]   within each and every one of us.
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.380]   That is the step number one.
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:41.300]   And step number two is recognizing
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.740]   that God has also rescued you.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:49.580]   You see, tucked in in this passage, right in the middle,
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.900]   when Paul is talking about his experiences of godliness
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.540]   and reminding Timothy what happened
[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.820]   in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra,
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.980]   he says these words at the end of verse 11.
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.460]   Which persecutions I endured,
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:05.580]   yet from them all the Lord rescued me.
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.980]   From all these things, the Lord rescued me.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.580]   So one, let's recognize, let's remember
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:16.380]   that we all inside us have a level of godlessness
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:20.380]   that we need to repent of, that we need to be aware of.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.700]   Each and every one of us.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.420]   But then before we get too down on ourselves,
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.220]   we also remind ourselves, just like Paul,
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:32.180]   just like Timothy, we have all been rescued.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.460]   By who?
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.980]   By the only one who is good.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:39.220]   By the only one who is perfect, Jesus.
[00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.260]   And why?
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:44.340]   Not just to save us, but then to equip us
[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.460]   for every good work right now.
[00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:51.500]   So that's the question, and that's the final question for us.
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.140]   What have you been rescued for?
[00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:57.460]   What have you been rescued for?
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.780]   May it be for the good works
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.260]   that the Lord has planned for you.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.340]   I'll finish with this verse that Paul talks about
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.740]   in Ephesians chapter two.
[00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:07.580]   For we are saved by grace through faith.
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.780]   Not your own doing, but a gift of God.
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.820]   Not resolve works, for we are his workmanship
[00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:18.060]   created in Christ Jesus for good works.
[00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.820]   May we recognize and accept
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:22.780]   that we are surrounded by godlessness,
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.540]   that we also have godlessness,
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.660]   but may we pursue godliness by sticking to the truth,
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.420]   and the ultimate truth, the one truth
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.500]   that he wants you to remember,
[00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.940]   that this pastor wants you to remember,
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.340]   that the Lord wants you to remember,
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.980]   that you have been rescued.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:39.820]   Shall we pray?
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:52.900]   Jesus, we thank you that you truly are the beautiful saviour.
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.900]   Will we spend a moment now and
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:03.060]   repent of the godlessness that exists in our hearts?
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.820]   Those 18 characteristics of godlessness
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.780]   that you warned Timothy about.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.900]   I know every single one of us here
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.260]   are at least guilty of one.
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:21.260]   Some may even be guilty of all 18.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:27.820]   But we take heart and recognize
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.780]   that despite all those things,
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.540]   regardless of all those things,
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.300]   we are deeply loved,
[00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:37.420]   that we have been saved and rescued by you.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:45.660]   So we respond to your charge for us to continue in truth,
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:48.460]   that we cling on to your word, your sacred word,
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.620]   the word that you breathed out,
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.380]   the word that is living and active,
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:54.460]   profitable for everything,
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.580]   for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training,
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:03.900]   in order that we would be equipped for every good work.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.500]   (gentle music)
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:13.340]   Lord, bring us people who we can imitate.
[00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:20.500]   May we be people that are worth imitating.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:29.500]   And Lord, may we be heavenly minded,
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:33.300]   but also still capable of earthly good.
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.900]   (gentle music)
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.020]   Thank you for this time.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:44.500]   And as we respond in worship to finish,
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:46.860]   we cast our eyes back to you,
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.500]   the one whom we desire to imitate,
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.100]   the one who saved us, the only one who is good.
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.020]   Jesus, you are the answer.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:42:00.660]   Jesus, you are the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.580]   So ultimately, we cling to you because you are the way,
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.700]   you are the truth, and you are the life.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.980]   Thank you, Lord.
