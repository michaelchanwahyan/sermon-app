1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,040
 Today I'm with my family, beautiful wife Christine, daughter Abigail, and Tomiko, my son.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,160
 Our last daughter is home.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,560
 She's not doing coronation.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,700
 I hope she does.

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,840
 She's doing homework.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,560
 So yeah, thank you very much.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,400
 I just want to talk a little bit about myself.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,720
 Originally we are from Zambia, and we are Zambians.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,520
 He wanted me to revise the geography.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,880
 Zambia is in the sub-Saharan Africa, specifically on the southern part.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,880
 Got independent in 1964 from the British, and now we are on our own.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,920
 So that's where I was born, and in a village called Lundazi.

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:02,600
 So my parents relocated to a city, Lusaka, and we grew up there.

14
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,720
 From a family of eight, I had elder brothers and sisters.

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,200
 I am the seventh one, and yeah, almost at the end, so I have a younger sister.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,800
 So today I want to just talk about my life in Zambia briefly.

17
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:30,360
 So in 1990, or the 1990s, what happened was that the nation suffered a crisis, financial

18
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,320
 crisis.

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,800
 And this was under the dictate of the IMF, because they had to tell the government to

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,920
 restructure, to change things here and there.

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,600
 So what that entailed was that many people had to lose their jobs.

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,640
 You know what it means when the companies are restructuring, okay, if you want us to

23
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,600
 help you, if you want us to look into this debt accordingly, you need to trim down.

24
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,120
 You need to lay off some people.

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,960
 And this affected a lot of households.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,840
 It affected a lot of families.

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:17,520
 Listen, ladies and gentlemen, as though that were not enough, it was the HIV and AIDS situation

28
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:26,120
 had just hit, and it was at its peak, it was escalating in the 1990s.

29
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:34,800
 And that meant some of the family heads, instead of going for work, they had to remain behind

30
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,080
 because they are sick, or every day they are at a hospital.

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,880
 And because of that, they were laid off.

32
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,520
 So that means a lot of people lost school places.

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,080
 I mean, the children weren't able to go to school, because that time, the government

34
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
 had not introduced free education.

35
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
 You had to pay.

36
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,920
 There was a fee.

37
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,760
 And a lot of children dropped off school.

38
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,480
 So this is what happened.

39
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,560
 Together with a group of people from a church that we were attending, we said, "We are going

40
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,520
 to educate these kids.

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,600
 We are going to start a school for them.

42
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,200
 We want to make sure that they're able to read.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,920
 They are missing out."

44
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,440
 This led me to resign from a job.

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:35,120
 I was working as a salesperson, as if you want, a petrol attendant at a gas station.

46
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,320
 And from that gas station, I survived two killings.

47
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,320
 I mean, I was at gunpoint.

48
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,360
 We're working in the night, and this guy just drives in and says, "Hey, can you fill my

49
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,480
 tank?"

50
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,520
 I go to the door to receive the money.

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,080
 He says, "Hey, out of here."

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,080
 First time.

53
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,400
 Second time, we were just resting at the backyard.

54
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
 Somebody comes and says, "Hey, give us all the money.

55
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,720
 Give us all the money."

56
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,720
 We had to do that.

57
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,840
 Guess what?

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,600
 I was saved from that.

59
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,640
 I believe that it was for a reason.

60
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,600
 I believe that God had something in store for me.

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,560
 He saved my life.

62
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:20,480
 And I left that job, not because of those guns, not because of that threat, but because

63
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,120
 we saw the kids that were unable to go to school.

64
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,640
 We went around the neighborhood.

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,320
 We went around the community, and we said, "Hey, come to this school.

66
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,760
 We are going to start a school at Jesus Army Church.

67
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,760
 Come, come, come, come."

68
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:39,200
 And we started a school in a makeshift kind of arrangement in terms of infrastructure,

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,840
 in terms of building.

70
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,800
 And there were 50 children that appeared on the very first day.

71
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,160
 So long story short, these children were written off.

72
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,460
 These children were unable to read.

73
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,680
 By the way, it's either a child has dropped out of school because of money, like I'm saying,

74
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,840
 or just a silly thing like without shoes.

75
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,100
 And we were like, "Come to school without shoes as long as you want to learn."

76
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:18,740
 So we gave them an opportunity to learn.

77
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,460
 In the first three years of operation, this is what we did.

78
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,900
 It was free, and all the teachers were voluntary.

79
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,700
 I was one of the teachers, as a matter of fact, leading these teachers on a voluntary

80
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
 basis.

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,180
 How do you survive?

82
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,180
 By faith.

83
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,380
 The Bible says, "Rashas, live by faith."

84
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,140
 And we were doing other things to make ends meet, but it was difficult.

85
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,940
 But we had to go on.

86
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,580
 We had to go on, and we continued because we had these children at heart.

87
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,580
 Later, we started collecting fees.

88
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,220
 These fees, ladies and gentlemen, will lead to nothing.

89
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,460
 So when we collect the money, we used to put it together, buy supplies.

90
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,060
 The remainder, we would share amongst ourselves.

91
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,620
 Maybe at times, I would be the last person to receive that.

92
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,620
 Just give other people.

93
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,740
 Just give other people.

94
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,440
 I don't know why that was happening, but we continued.

95
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,340
 We hung on in there.

96
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,500
 We hung in there.

97
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,220
 And the Lord is faithful, and he came through, and he helped us.

98
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
 So there was no money.

99
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,420
 The little that we got, we didn't call it a salary even.

100
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,620
 It was just an allowance.

101
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,780
 That if you are on school break, there is no allowance.

102
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
 There is nothing.

103
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:57,100
 But with a joy, we continued.

104
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,820
 And this is what was happening.

105
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,240
 We were not just looking at life in the classroom or in the school.

106
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,460
 We had life beyond.

107
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,940
 This is how come sometimes I would receive a knock.

108
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,900
 We didn't have no cell phones.

109
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,900
 Yes?

110
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,420
 We didn't have -- only a few people that had cell phones.

111
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,820
 The privilege at that time in the '90s.

112
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:27,380
 And knock at our door in the night, in the middle of the night, and somebody says, "I

113
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,540
 have no food."

114
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,020
 And this is apparent to the child who comes to school.

115
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,340
 We only know them by virtue of the child coming to our school.

116
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,340
 And they think, "Well, I can find help there."

117
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,420
 But there is no help.

118
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,380
 So what do you do?

119
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:55,200
 You sacrifice the little that you have and give it to the people that come.

120
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,420
 So in Zambia, we also started a church.

121
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:08,340
 And the church that we started was actually full of the kids that we were serving.

122
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,100
 Because most of them didn't know the law.

123
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,700
 They didn't have the relationship with God.

124
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,460
 They didn't have.

125
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,820
 And we started a church.

126
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,280
 The church was already there, but we planted another one.

127
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,860
 Most of them came to that church.

128
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,100
 And their parents.

129
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:35,180
 So we passed that church up to 2012, from 2005.

130
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,120
 I had to leave Zambia.

131
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,540
 I was leaving the school from 1998.

132
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,140
 That's when it started.

133
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:48,780
 And then in 2012, I left the school to come and work in Hong Kong.

134
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,460
 I joined Crossroads Foundation.

135
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,740
 And in Crossroads Foundation, one thing that...

136
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,980
 I wasn't feeling good whenever I see a wheelchair.

137
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,860
 I avoided touching a wheelchair.

138
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,620
 Because when I was leaving Zambia, my father was bound to a wheelchair.

139
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,620
 And he blessed me.

140
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,300
 And he said, "Go well, my son.

141
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,660
 If I had strength, I was going to jump up off this wheelchair to take you to the airport."

142
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,660
 And you know what?

143
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,780
 A father's blessing is important.

144
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,620
 And he says, "God bless you.

145
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,140
 Go well."

146
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,580
 And with that, I had to come to Hong Kong in joy.

147
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,260
 But whenever I see a wheelchair, I would...

148
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,220
 I remember my father.

149
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,980
 But listen to me.

150
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,860
 You need to be obedient.

151
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,860
 I said, "Okay, I'm going to clean this wheelchair.

152
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,860
 I'm going to prepare it.

153
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,740
 And I will put it on the container that is going to go to Moldova.

154
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,720
 That is going to go to the Philippines.

155
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,820
 The container that is going to go to an African country.

156
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,220
 For I know how it is going to help."

157
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,460
 Listen, ladies and gentlemen.

158
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:02,460
 I've been on either side.

159
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,700
 One side where we receive a container.

160
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,820
 And on the other side where we pack a container.

161
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,720
 And when you pack that container, you know the impact that it is going to have.

162
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,860
 You know the impact.

163
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,100
 You know the lives.

164
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,900
 You know how many children are going to be touched because of the container that you're

165
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
 packing.

166
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,020
 As a result, you go for it.

167
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
 You serve.

168
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,220
 I love wheelchairs, man.

169
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,740
 From that time, the trauma that I had was like, "Okay, fine.

170
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:38,100
 It is important that I pass through this thing so that I can understand what other people

171
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,540
 need."

172
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,860
 How it helped my father.

173
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:48,580
 I know that I want to step into the shoe of another man that needs a wheelchair.

174
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,300
 For this matter, I'm going to clean it.

175
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,100
 And when I send it out of Hong Kong, I want it received with dignity.

176
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,140
 And I continued serving in Crossroads.

177
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,780
 I continued.

178
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,140
 I used to go in homes.

179
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,300
 Sometimes people come to my office and say, "We want a bank bed."

180
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,060
 But they don't know how to assemble it.

181
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,380
 I just go an extra mile.

182
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,260
 I go home later and my wife says, "Hey, where were you?"

183
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,740
 I said, "Honey, there was this lady.

184
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,500
 She has three children.

185
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,740
 And they're living in this house.

186
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,260
 And they don't even know how to assemble a bank bed."

187
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:38,380
 Listen, when you give somebody a piece of furniture, your job should end there.

188
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:45,500
 But if you listen to the inner voice, you cannot stay.

189
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
 You want to go an extra mile.

190
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,500
 Okay, so I just want to tell you something about the refugees.

191
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,820
 And I'll share a few stories.

192
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,020
 And then we'll go on and look at a few verses.

193
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:05,860
 Two weeks ago, Dr. Susanna was able to give us a demographic situation in terms of life

194
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,940
 in Hong Kong.

195
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,380
 She did emphasize how there is this gap between the poor and the rich, how that it is widening.

196
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,580
 I want to believe that this is world over, right?

197
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,580
 These things are happening world over, not just in Hong Kong, but specifically to Hong

198
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,580
 Kong.

199
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,580
 She gave us these demographics.

200
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:27,220
 And I want to add to it that among those people that she was describing are refugees.

201
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,140
 Trust me, refugees are even worse.

202
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,380
 They're even worse.

203
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:42,540
 You heard how Pastor John just introduced that scenario of refugees not being allowed

204
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:51,060
 to work, of refugees being not allowed even to line up for whatever medical condition

205
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,300
 that is, you know, procedure.

206
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,060
 Just to line up, they don't even have a right.

207
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:09,660
 I want to emphasize today that what Dr. Susanna was saying includes the refugees.

208
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:16,500
 Let me take this opportunity to thank KFCI for having supported Branches of Hope.

209
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,300
 I know you have supported Branches of Hope.

210
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,980
 And thank you so much.

211
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
 God bless you.

212
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,260
 God bless the work of your hand.

213
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,020
 So let me just tell you a few stories about these refugees that I have an opportunity

214
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,420
 to talk with.

215
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:41,700
 On March 6, there was ... Do you want to go back to that?

216
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,260
 Go back to that, okay.

217
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,860
 Yeah, just to start.

218
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,660
 Come back to that later.

219
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,780
 March 6, this woman called Kay.

220
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:58,340
 She walks into the office and she comes to my desk and says, "Mr. Green," at least that's

221
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,060
 what they call me, they call me Mr. Green.

222
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,380
 She's like, "Mr. Green, I would like to have some baby clothes.

223
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:12,500
 I would like to have some baby diapers, baby wet wipes, and so on and so forth."

224
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,780
 And she just gave me a wish list.

225
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:21,340
 And I made an appointment for her to go and pick up, because as Branches of Hope, we work

226
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,620
 with other organizations that we can collaborate with.

227
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,800
 For instance, those people that are going to do legal services, we don't have the capacity.

228
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,260
 We have very little capacity in terms of in-kind donation, and we refer them.

229
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:39,220
 And the first place we refer them to was Crossroads.

230
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,020
 And the appointment is fixed.

231
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,260
 Listen to me, ladies and gentlemen, she calls me and she says, "Hey, Mr. Green, can we change

232
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,140
 this appointment to at least April?"

233
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,340
 I said, "Okay."

234
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,580
 And then it was changed.

235
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,780
 She calls me again and say, "Can we change this appointment up to May?"

236
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,180
 What is it with the changing of appointments?

237
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
 Is there a problem?

238
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,060
 And she says, "Yes, Mr. Green.

239
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,580
 My baby is in the hospital."

240
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,980
 I said, "When did she go there?"

241
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,540
 She said, "She was born six months ago.

242
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,780
 In fact, four months ago."

243
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,900
 That's what she told me.

244
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,420
 And she has never been home.

245
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,420
 This baby has never been home.

246
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,220
 This is how come I'm postponing.

247
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,420
 This is how come I'm just deferring.

248
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,980
 Because I don't have anywhere to put these things when I receive them, because I'm sharing

249
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,740
 with my two friends.

250
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,300
 I'm in a shared space.

251
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
 This is where I live.

252
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,260
 And my baby cannot come to that space.

253
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:55,500
 When I get my baby out of the hospital, I'm going to start living with the father in Kuta."

254
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,860
 I said, "Oh, so are you separated?"

255
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:06,380
 And then she says, "Actually, I'm only hoping that the baby's father would take her on,

256
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,900
 because she's already married to another woman.

257
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,460
 Not only are we separated, but she's married to another woman."

258
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,420
 I said, "Oh, really?"

259
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,820
 Then I called her again.

260
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:28,860
 This time around, it was actually on 5th April.

261
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,860
 I called her.

262
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,100
 I said, "Hey, Kay.

263
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
 How are you doing?

264
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,540
 How is your baby this time?"

265
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,460
 She prefers to do an audio.

266
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,900
 She said, "Mr. Green, my baby is still sick.

267
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,220
 My baby is now on oxygen.

268
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,380
 I am afraid.

269
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,220
 I don't know what is going to happen."

270
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,340
 I said, "Does the father visit?"

271
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,340
 "No.

272
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,740
 Only my two friends.

273
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,060
 No other person visits me."

274
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,700
 And she's on oxygen.

275
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,500
 I'm afraid, Mr. Green.

276
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,140
 You know what?

277
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:13,860
 When you hear such kind of a thing, you're moved by compassion.

278
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,860
 You're moved.

279
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,980
 You remember what Pastor John was telling us about compassion, that the Greek word for

280
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:25,460
 compassion is splas nizomai.

281
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,060
 It's not just an ordinary thing.

282
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:35,860
 It's something that you feel inside of you, in the deeper ends of your body, your bowels.

283
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,140
 They move.

284
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,820
 And when that thing happens to you, you cannot just stand still.

285
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,260
 When this thing happens to you, ladies and gentlemen, you want to do something.

286
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,220
 If this thing happens to you, if something begins to move here, I wonder whether you're

287
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,220
 going to sit and fold your hands.

288
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,260
 I was like, "Oh, I don't have money.

289
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,340
 I'm not a medical doctor.

290
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,700
 What am I going to do?

291
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,100
 I know I have something in me."

292
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,820
 Of course, I was not telling her that.

293
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,940
 Then to me, ladies and gentlemen, I said, "Can I pray for her?"

294
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,820
 I just said, "Yes, Mr. Green."

295
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
 I prayed.

296
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:19,060
 I'm like, "Father God, in the name of Jesus, this baby has been sick, has been in this

297
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:23,620
 hospital and the mother has been waiting.

298
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,740
 You know how long she's been waiting?

299
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,740
 Please Lord, heal her."

300
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,300
 I am praying, I'm praying.

301
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,020
 The lady starts to sob afterwards and she's like, "Thank you.

302
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,300
 Thank you, Mr. Green.

303
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,100
 By the way, she's a Muslim.

304
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,740
 I pray that the Lord is going to touch her one day.

305
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:49,380
 I pray that the Lord is going to come through for her and that she is going to turn to him."

306
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,980
 Listen, then I called her again.

307
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,820
 This was just on 4th May, before yesterday.

308
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,620
 I said, "Hey, how is the baby?"

309
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:09,780
 She said, "Mr. Green, the baby is fine, but she had COVID.

310
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,660
 She had COVID from the hospital.

311
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,220
 You know, she stayed in the hospital for two weeks.

312
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
 By the way, it's Queen Mary.

313
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,820
 We're not discrediting the hospital.

314
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,060
 They did all they could.

315
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,980
 The baby was, you know, yeah, but we thank God because I mean, it's something that is

316
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,980
 inevitable.

317
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,500
 You know, when you're confined like that.

318
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:36,020
 So, she said, "The baby is fine, but the doctor says after recovering from COVID, soon

319
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,500
 she's going to come home.

320
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,100
 However, they gave me a condition.

321
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,980
 You cannot take this baby to a shared space.

322
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,260
 You need to find your own space."

323
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,860
 Now, how is she going to make it?

324
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:57,260
 I know that the government through the social warfare, they provide housing, you know, allowance

325
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,540
 and everything, and it's just little.

326
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,780
 You and me know, it's very little.

327
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,580
 It's meager, very little.

328
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,300
 But she said, "Now, I have problems.

329
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,500
 I don't know what to do.

330
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
 The father won't accept this baby because we're divorced."

331
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:21,260
 This baby is so beautiful.

332
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:29,660
 Her name is F. Fiaza.

333
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,660
 Look at that baby.

334
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,660
 So beautiful.

335
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:44,220
 This baby needs your prayer.

336
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,940
 I want to tell you another family.

337
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,660
 I called them Mother Anne and her two sons.

338
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:58,860
 I was careful not to write M-O-M-N, like Mom Anne.

339
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,220
 I want it to be English.

340
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,180
 So, Mother Anne and her two sons.

341
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:10,380
 One son is six years and the other one is eight years.

342
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:16,020
 As a matter of fact, Pastor John, if you remember, I talked about a boy called Siam.

343
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,940
 This is the same family.

344
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:22,820
 It seems I'm just connected to them.

345
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,540
 Not intentionally.

346
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,940
 It just happens.

347
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,860
 This is on the 13th of April.

348
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,860
 By the way, before I go there, I am walking.

349
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,060
 I'm going to work, Branches of Hope.

350
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,260
 We are at a traffic light.

351
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,260
 We're waiting to cross.

352
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,420
 As we cross, I realize a boy is on the phone.

353
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:45,420
 I got concerned.

354
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,420
 I said, "Hey, what's happening?

355
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,380
 Let me see who this boy is and who the mother is."

356
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,460
 It so happens that it was the boy that I know, Siam.

357
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,820
 This boy, this time around, he's in the company of his sibling.

358
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,820
 The three.

359
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,820
 I'm like, "Oh, hello, hello, hello, hello."

360
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,820
 Then we're going.

361
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:09,380
 They were going to Branches of Hope for the program that I run together with my colleagues.

362
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,180
 Then I said, "How come today you're coming with two children?

363
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,900
 How come there are three of you?"

364
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,260
 He said, "You know what, Mr. Green?

365
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,660
 Because there's no one at home to remain with the other child.

366
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:31,780
 Because only last night, only last night, we escorted, we took the father to the airport."

367
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,140
 Because immigration was like, "Come right now.

368
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,620
 Pack your bags right now."

369
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,620
 I don't know about you.

370
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,420
 Some of you might know about the removal policy.

371
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,420
 Things have changed.

372
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,220
 If your claim is not accepted, there and then, there's not going to be any appeal.

373
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,880
 You don't know when you're going to go.

374
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,940
 We're living in fear.

375
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,260
 We've just been hearing these things.

376
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,940
 I have seen this firsthand.

377
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,380
 One family that I'm dealing with, separated, just like that.

378
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:10,300
 And then on the 13th of ... A few, I think one week later, this thing happened.

379
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,940
 The children are playing, and the two children are playing, and they smash a window.

380
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,100
 The child had 10 stitches.

381
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:26,460
 At 9 p.m., they call an ambulance, and the child was in hospital for two days.

382
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,620
 And there's no one to take the other child, the older one, to school.

383
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:38,780
 Because the mother has to attend to the one that is in the hospital.

384
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:47,580
 If she goes to school, I mean, if she takes the boy to school, that means she's not going

385
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,460
 to visit the hospital, as it were.

386
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,340
 There's another schedule in Hong Kong where schools are concerned.

387
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:59,940
 And so, he has to tag along to go to the hospital when the mother is going to nurse.

388
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:09,420
 Ladies and gentlemen, when I look at this, she said, "Oh, Mr. Green, I'm so scared, because

389
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:15,620
 the landlord is going to ask me to repair, and I don't have no money.

390
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:21,860
 And I haven't even told the landlord about what happened, because she's going to say,

391
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,580
 'Pay right away, repair it.'"

392
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,740
 What am I going to do?

393
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:35,580
 Branches of Hope has got no budget for such things sometimes.

394
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,260
 I go online, and I search.

395
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,100
 I find an organization called Build and Wish.

396
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
 And I call them.

397
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,180
 I said, "I have this problem."

398
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,060
 And they said, "Okay, where is it?"

399
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,060
 I said, "It's in Jordan."

400
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:54,020
 And then they said, "Okay, I'm going to send you a form to fill.

401
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,020
 Sorry, it's in Chinese.

402
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,940
 You need somebody to help you translate it."

403
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,500
 And then he said, "Oh, by the way, you need to pay us $300.

404
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
 We're not rich people.

405
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,140
 There are people that go around Hong Kong.

406
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
 Maybe you know them.

407
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:14,020
 The people go around Hong Kong that renovate poor people's property or living space.

408
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,900
 Poor people don't own property, but they're renting.

409
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,180
 So they renovate for them."

410
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:22,140
 And I reached out to these guys, and they said, "Yes, we're going to do it, but you

411
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,540
 need to give us $300."

412
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:30,500
 They said, "It's administrative or appreciation fees or something like that."

413
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,780
 Look, when people are struggling like that, my heart breaks.

414
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,060
 You see how the window is broken there?

415
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,180
 I don't know what breaks yours.

416
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,100
 I don't know what breaks your heart.

417
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:49,540
 But such situations are the situations that break my heart to pieces.

418
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,940
 And God helps to bring those pieces together.

419
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,540
 God helps to bring those pieces together, and he helps.

420
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:01,460
 I want you to know that these are some of the people that we serve.

421
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:08,620
 So I'm just praying that help is going to come for this woman.

422
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,140
 She's now alone with the children.

423
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:20,700
 Very quickly, the next one is Mother A and Son.

424
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,300
 Mother A and Son T. They need glasses.

425
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,740
 Every time a child goes for an assessment, and they just give them a prescription, and

426
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,100
 they say it's very expensive.

427
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,140
 And the mother, the same.

428
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:44,220
 Ladies and gentlemen, only yesterday I had the privilege to go into the living space.

429
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,820
 Forget about the glasses, forget about the prescription.

430
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:54,420
 But one thing that really broke my heart, I was just telling my family last night, I

431
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,420
 was late.

432
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,420
 I'm late.

433
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:03,500
 I'm leaving the office late, and this woman just comes and says, "Mr. Greeney, come.

434
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,380
 Mr. Greeney, come.

435
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,020
 I don't know how to measure.

436
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,420
 I want to..."

437
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:15,180
 She's receiving a wardrobe from Crossroads, but she says, "I want to measure because I

438
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,300
 don't know how to measure."

439
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,300
 She's uneducated with all due respect.

440
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,700
 She can't use a tape measure.

441
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,380
 I said, "Look, I am late.

442
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,620
 I'm running late."

443
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,620
 What do you do in such cases?

444
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,500
 You just go, and I went.

445
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,300
 I was holding my tears back, not because of what she told me.

446
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,300
 When we entered the house, I thought we were still going to the house.

447
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,620
 We are yet to enter the house.

448
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,260
 But she says, "We're here."

449
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:48,380
 She says, "Sorry, Mr. Green, our house is small."

450
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,860
 Tea, the son was like, "Mr. Green, how do you like my place?"

451
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,580
 Everything is just in one place.

452
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,380
 She says, "I don't like it."

453
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,660
 I said, "You know what, Tea?

454
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,260
 Other people do not have a roof over their head.

455
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,260
 They sleep on the street.

456
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,660
 You've got to be thankful."

457
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:13,860
 But listen to me, I was holding my tears back because the space is like this.

458
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
 A small cube.

459
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,860
 Okay, a small cube.

460
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,740
 I'm like, "Where is she going to put the wardrobe?"

461
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,540
 So I measured and I sent it across.

462
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:29,420
 This morning I was saying, "These are the dimensions for two centimeters, 199 high and

463
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,700
 45 centimeters wide, deep 42 centimeters.

464
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:39,500
 These are the people that we serve.

465
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,180
 These are the people that are in Hong Kong.

466
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:50,580
 Yes, they're refugees in Hong Kong and the instructions are very hard.

467
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,580
 Why we serve?

468
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
 Why do we serve?

469
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:58,820
 I just want to share a few biblical reasons, three as a matter of fact.

470
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,300
 Why we serve?

471
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,500
 So I want to say serving is an act of submission.

472
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:11,500
 You cannot serve if you do not submit yourself to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.

473
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,500
 You cannot serve.

474
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:22,820
 Now, even if you are already a Christian and if you have a prompt to serve and you're not

475
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,180
 submissive, it's difficult to serve.

476
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:34,940
 If you're going to serve for the sake of it, you're going to grow weary.

477
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,500
 You're going to grow tired.

478
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,700
 You're going to seek people's praise.

479
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,700
 I don't care who is looking at me.

480
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,380
 I don't care who is clapping or not.

481
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:51,340
 I have to serve because I have to submit.

482
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:58,740
 Let's read a couple of scriptures here.

483
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:04,020
 Serving is an act of submission.

484
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,780
 Before we read the one on the screen, this one is not on the screen, it's 1 Peter 3,

485
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,780
 verse 8.

486
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:19,180
 Finally, all of you be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble.

487
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,420
 We're not reading that one.

488
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:27,820
 Pastor John has alluded to it and it's been going and it's up on the screen there.

489
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:36,460
 But I wanted to say we need to submit ourselves to Christ and we need to humble ourselves.

490
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:42,860
 When we humble ourselves, we are taking the Christ-like trait.

491
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,980
 We become more like Jesus.

492
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,500
 We become more like him.

493
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:55,700
 I'm here to encourage you to say when you submit, you're going to put others first.

494
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,700
 When you submit, you're not going to put your interests in front of others.

495
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,420
 It is going to be others than you.

496
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,940
 Like Jesus is our perfect example.

497
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,860
 He submitted himself.

498
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:11,460
 He humbled himself up to the cross.

499
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,900
 Death, even death on a cross.

500
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:22,500
 I want to encourage you, ladies and gentlemen, that when you take that attitude, when you

501
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,180
 take that attitude, you are going to begin shifting.

502
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:32,580
 I want to believe that there are so many times that we have been called to volunteer and

503
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,260
 only a few people come to volunteer.

504
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,260
 That's fine.

505
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:42,580
 I want you to realize that when you're humble enough, automatically you are going to shift

506
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,180
 from being served to serving others.

507
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:52,580
 Automatically you are going to shift from a situation of being first, but then you're

508
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,740
 going to let others go before.

509
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:00,460
 Ladies and gentlemen, I want to encourage you that what we need is a paradigm shift

510
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:06,380
 in the model of being served, from the model of being served to the model of serving others.

511
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,020
 I want to encourage you.

512
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,980
 You have to learn to be humble.

513
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,380
 I have to learn to be humble.

514
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,900
 After that, I will serve.

515
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,900
 This is submission.

516
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:32,460
 Listen, ladies and gentlemen, submission is not compliance.

517
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,940
 Some people just submit for the sake of.

518
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,940
 You're only complying.

519
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,740
 You're not obeying.

520
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,100
 Jesus Christ obeyed.

521
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,660
 He obeyed.

522
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:50,300
 Ladies and gentlemen, I pray that there's going to be a shift in your life.

523
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,540
 I pray there's going to be a shift in your life.

524
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,420
 I pray there's going to be a shift in my life.

525
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,860
 That shift from me first to others first.

526
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:05,820
 That shift from I don't know what to do.

527
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:21,900
 That shift from being asked, "Can I do something?" to, "Can I do something for you?"

528
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:28,140
 The other point I want to share is serving speaks.

529
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
 Serving speaks.

530
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:41,420
 You serve, you're actually sending a message about the love of God, about salvation.

531
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:49,740
 Of course, I want to emphasize that serving people does not save people.

532
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,740
 But in a way, they might just come to you and say, "Oh, you're a Christian."

533
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,660
 No wonder.

534
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:04,340
 People come and say, "Hey, how do you survive without a salary in Crossroads?"

535
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,700
 And then they come and say, "You're a Christian."

536
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,660
 I say, "Yes, I'm a Christian."

537
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,740
 You don't need to blow a trumpet.

538
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,980
 I am a Christian.

539
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:18,700
 No, they see what you do.

540
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,820
 Your action will speak.

541
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,700
 Your serving will speak.

542
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:29,540
 I have a lot of people coming to me and say, "Are you a Christian?"

543
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,540
 I say, "Yes."

544
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,540
 And they say, "No wonder."

545
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,780
 And I say, "How do you know?"

546
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,100
 And then they say, "I can tell."

547
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:46,300
 The other day, I'm just, "Oh, if you are submissive, if you are serving, you don't need an announcement.

548
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,020
 People will know you.

549
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:51,260
 They will know you're a Christian."

550
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,700
 I don't know whether you do this in this church.

551
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,820
 Just tell the next person seated to you, "They will know you."

552
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,460
 Oh, yes.

553
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:05,180
 They will know you.

554
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:11,060
 Let's read the scripture there.

555
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,900
 Can I have a scripture come up?

556
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,340
 Matthew chapter 5.

557
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:26,700
 In the same way, let your light shine before men that they may see your good work and glorify

558
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,980
 your Father which is in heaven.

559
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,540
 You may not evangelize, ladies and gentlemen.

560
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,300
 You may not know how to speak, ladies and gentlemen.

561
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,340
 You may not have money to give, ladies and gentlemen.

562
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:46,740
 But whatever little you do, it counts.

563
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:53,620
 It might draw someone to Christ and glorify our Father which is in heaven.

564
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:59,740
 Let your light so shine.

565
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,260
 Don't hide the light.

566
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,580
 Everyone here has something to do.

567
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,620
 We've heard this over and over.

568
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:10,260
 We have been equipped.

569
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,300
 And the last point, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say, when you serve, you are but

570
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,940
 keeping what has been entrusted unto you.

571
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,580
 Serving is stewardship.

572
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:30,300
 Listen, if you have been given something to keep, it is not yours.

573
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,860
 If you have been entrusted with something, you've got to take care of it.

574
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,180
 And how do we take care of what God has given unto us?

575
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,780
 We take care by serving others with it.

576
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:50,220
 We take care of what God has given unto us by, you know, blessing others.

577
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:55,460
 I remember a niece of mine in Zambia.

578
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:01,260
 She is so prayerful, very young, and she goes in the community.

579
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:07,940
 She finds people that are sick and then she washes them.

580
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,900
 These are people that are living alone.

581
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,100
 She washes them.

582
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,380
 She does the dishes.

583
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,460
 She does the cleaning and everything, the laundry.

584
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,660
 She did this for a long time and she had very good results.

585
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:25,780
 And somebody just came to her and said, "Hey, I'm looking for somebody to employ as a house

586
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,260
 maid, as a house help."

587
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,300
 And my niece was employed.

588
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:36,340
 And this kind woman looked at her and said, "Esnet, what do you want to do in life?

589
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,260
 Do you have your school results?"

590
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,420
 She produced her school results and said, "These are good results.

591
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,460
 How come you're not doing nothing?"

592
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,780
 And she says, "I have no money to go to college."

593
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,100
 And she says, "Okay, what do you want to do?"

594
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,140
 "I want to do nursing."

595
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:56,060
 Not because she wants to do nursing for the sake of it, but it is in her heart.

596
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,620
 That's a gift.

597
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:03,820
 She wants to keep this gift as a steward by passing on unto others.

598
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,220
 And God expanded her.

599
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,340
 Instead of saving a few people, she's going to save a lot of people that are walking into

600
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,540
 the hospital.

601
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,020
 What God has given us should be used to the benefit of others.

602
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,540
 We need to bless others with what has been trusted.

603
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:34,500
 Luke 12 verse 48, and then we'll be done.

604
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:53,300
 But the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating.

605
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:58,540
 One to whom much was given of much will be required.

606
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:04,980
 And from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand more.

607
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:11,420
 Ladies and gentlemen, I want to say, if you have a great gift, your responsibility should

608
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,860
 be great.

609
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,620
 If you have a greater one, your responsibility should be greater.

610
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,920
 It's not for you to keep.

611
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,340
 It's not for you to enjoy.

612
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,180
 It's for you to pass on to others.

613
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,020
 It's for you to serve others.

614
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:29,700
 It's for you to obey and go with it and say, "Somebody needs to benefit from this."

615
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,340
 To whom much is given, much is required.

616
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:37,340
 KFC, you have been equipped.

617
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:42,100
 Much has been offloaded by people that are coming, by passing on.

618
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,700
 And other pastors in this church, they have equipped.

619
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,340
 They keep to equip.

620
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:53,220
 So that equipping is not for the sake of us receiving, but we need to go out there so

621
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,900
 that we are strengthened, so that other people can benefit.

622
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,060
 Much has been given and it's time to stand.

623
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,180
 It's time to go.

624
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:14,540
 I want to encourage you to do something.

625
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:23,180
 Having heard all of these things in Hong Kong and elsewhere, what are you going to do about

626
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
 it?

627
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,500
 Listen to me.

628
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,300
 There is something that you can do.

629
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,180
 I remember Pastor John said, "You can start from somewhere."

630
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,620
 Let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, we started a makeshift school.

631
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,660
 We started from somewhere.

632
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,260
 Incomplete buildings and we started.

633
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:54,740
 Do you know those kids that passed through those dirty walls, some of them are doctors

634
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,180
 today.

635
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:59,020
 Some of them are teachers today.

636
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,260
 Remember I said these are children that were written off.

637
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,020
 It took submission.

638
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,740
 It took realization that we need to speak.

639
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:13,600
 It took realization that we need to be stewards.

640
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,020
 So you can do something.

641
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,860
 You can start from somewhere.

642
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,700
 Right now if you have a phone, this is the only time that you're going to be allowed,

643
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,500
 I guess, to use a phone in the church.

644
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,300
 I would like you to grab a phone.

645
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,500
 Take it out now.

646
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,140
 Let's do this.

647
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:38,260
 If you want to mark a time when you will pray for any cause that is dear to your heart,

648
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:39,260
 mark it.

649
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,580
 Make a calendar, make an alarm.

650
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,500
 When they want to pray for the refugees or maybe you want to pray for this mother that

651
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,320
 I've been sharing about.

652
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,740
 It could be baby.

653
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,740
 It could be the mother.

654
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:53,740
 Pray for their salvation.

655
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,860
 Pray for healing.

656
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,860
 Pray for resources.

657
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:00,100
 Pray that their needs be met.

658
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:05,180
 The other thing that you can do is to just educate yourself.

659
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,900
 You see what I did?

660
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:14,700
 I went online and said, "Which organizations can do repair works for people free?"

661
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,460
 And I found this one.

662
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,140
 You can do the same.

663
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,540
 I'm not saying you should find organizations that help people.

664
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:27,380
 Find organizations that you can help.

665
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:33,980
 Organizations that you can be a part of, to work in, to partner with, or even to pray

666
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
 for.

667
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,980
 It's good.

668
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,980
 It's good yourself.

669
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,980
 That's what I did.

670
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,980
 That's what I did.

671
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,380
 Thankfully, I found Build and Wish.

672
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,780
 So do research.

673
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:49,860
 Having done that, you need to just say, "Okay, I want to volunteer."

674
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,860
 Get involved.

675
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:54,460
 Do something.

676
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:03,500
 Whatever you do, in summary, I want to say serving is an act.

677
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,020
 An act of submission.

678
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,780
 Serving speaks.

679
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:18,500
 Serving is stewardship.

680
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,460
 All these things, it's all about Jesus.

681
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,100
 It's all about Jesus.

682
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:28,180
 It's all about Jesus.

683
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,180
