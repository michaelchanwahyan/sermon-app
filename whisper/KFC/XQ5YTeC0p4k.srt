1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Doing a great job.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 And he did a great job for us last week,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 telling us about the Father's heart, the Father's heart.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 And the Father so loved the world that he sent his one and only son,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 and that is Jesus, to us as an example for us.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And today we're going to learn about Jesus and the leper.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 A couple years ago, I went to India.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Actually, that was one of the mission trips I went to.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Has anybody been to India before?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 You may have been to India before.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 And just like Russell Peter says, when you go to India,

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 your senses come alive.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Okay?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Your sense of smell, the things you see, the things you hear.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 You could be crossing the road with goats and oxes,

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 and the street just stops for goats.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 It's not for goats, for oxes, for cows.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 There's such poverty there as well, and it really opens your eyes and your ears.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I remember one time I was riding the trains.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Trains are a crazy experience as well.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Have you been to one of the trains?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Yeah, you have to, like, rush in and, like, basically body check your way in

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 because there's lots of people.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Imagine the MTR times 10.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Okay?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 The MTR times 10.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 And to get out, you've got to push your way out near the door

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 so that you get out the next exit

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 because on the next exit, do you know who's coming in?

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Grandmas are just coming in.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Grandpas are coming in.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 They don't care who's there.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 They're coming in.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So you've got to be right at the exit to get out.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Okay?

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 This was my India experience.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 It was crazy.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And I remember one time I was just at the trains,

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 and it was exactly just like this.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I saw tons of garbage just everywhere.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And I was talking with one of my Indian friends who was a student,

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 and I was like, "How come people are just throwing trash there?

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 How come people don't pick it up?"

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 And he's like, "Oh, there's only certain people to pick this up,

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 and they're actually called the Dalits,

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 and they're the caste, the untouchable caste."

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 And in the next slide, you'll see that there's a caste system in India,

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 and the Dalits are on the bottom.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 And a lot of them are street cleaners,

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 and they have simple tasks, very simple tasks.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And a lot of them are actually abused and looked down upon.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 One quote says this,

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 "Dalits are not allowed to drink from the same wells,

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 attend the same temples,

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 wear shoes in the presence of the upper caste,

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 or drink from some cups in some tea stalls.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Dalits are looked down upon.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 They're the untouchables.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 They're expected to clean up the garbage.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 They're expected to be low."

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 I remember I was in University of Toronto,

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 and well, before I wasn't paid to play basketball,

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 and now I am.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 So in the next slide, you'll see the University of Toronto.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I played on Division 1.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 There's four divisions, okay, and I played Div 1.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 And Div 1, most people were at least six feet, six feet tall.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And so I joined--I was able to make my team

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 because they were the worst team, all right?

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 They were the untouchable team, untouchable team.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And I was the shortest--I was one of the shortest guys on this team.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And because I didn't live on campus, I didn't go to practice,

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 and so they put me very far down the bench, okay?

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 I remember this one time, the coach subbed me in,

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 and I played for 30 seconds, and then he subbed me out.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And he was like, "Good minute."

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 And I'm like, "Yeah, good minute."

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 I was like, "I played a minute."

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I was just like, "Come on."

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 I was like the untouchable on this untouchable team.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Now, not the untouchable where you can't trade a person,

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 where he's so valuable he's untouchable.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I'm untouchable where you only play him 30 seconds

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 just to say that he participated,

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 just so that, you know, he can be happy for a little bit.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And so I was the untouchable on this team.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 JP knows what it means to be untouchable.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 [laughter]

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Let's read Mark 1 together, the story we just saw on the video.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Let's read the scripture together.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 One, two, three.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 "A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees,

93
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 'If you are willing, you can make me clean.'

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Jesus was enigmate.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 He reached out his hand and touched the man.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 'I am willing,' he said. 'Be clean.'"

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 Leprosy.

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Does anybody know anybody with leprosy today?

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 You do.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 It's not that common anymore because we have a cure for it.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 We have a cure for it.

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 The symptoms of leprosy are it's an infectious disease

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 caused by mycobacterium lyprae.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 It affects the skin.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 It affects your nerves.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Has anybody have nerves that are numb, that they can't--

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Have you ever felt like you couldn't feel your hands before?

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 It's a little too cold?

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 This is what happens when it gets worse.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 You sort of lose your feelings on your toes and your hands.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Due to injury, they can lose their hands and their toes.

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 If it even gets worse, it could affect your breathing.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Some people can lose their eyes, literally lose their eyes.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 If you have leprosy, what you would do nowadays

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 is you would go to a doctor.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 It's a medical problem.

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 It's a bacterial infectious disease that you have.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 And it's transmitted by droplets.

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Speaking, when we had this huge plexiglass thing

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 to prevent COVID, similar.

121
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It was transmitted by droplets.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But nowadays, if you get leprosy, it's curable.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 It's okay, especially in the early stages.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 You don't have to be disabled.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 You don't have to lose your eyes.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 There is a cure.

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 There is a cure.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Now, here are some pictures of leprosy.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 I chose the most decent ones for you guys.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 In the early stages, it could cause blemishes in your skin.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 And in the later stages, it could cause your fingers,

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 because of the nerve damages to your nerves.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 It could cause your fingers and your feet to go.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 Now, do you know the history of leprosy in the Bible?

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 Who was the first person to have leprosy?

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Anybody know?

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Haman?

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Naaman, yes.

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Naaman, yes, he had leprosy.

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And he was miraculously healed, right?

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 Elijah told him to go to the Jordan River.

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 But there was a person before that.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Miriam, that's right.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 Do you know why Miriam got leprosy?

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Do you know why he got leprosy?

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Because he was on his phone while the sermon was happening.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Is that right?

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 Is that what was happening?

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 I see you guys, don't worry.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 I see you.

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 No, that wasn't the reason, all right?

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 It wasn't the reason.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Let's read it.

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 I'll just read it for you.

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of his wife.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 The woman that he married was not an Israelite, all right?

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 He was a Cushite.

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 They said to him, "Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses?

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 Has he not spoken through us also?"

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And the Lord heard it.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 The Lord heard it.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 What was the Lord's response?

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Let's see.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 "Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
 And he departed when the cloud removed from the tent, over the tent.

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 Behold, Miriam was leprous like snow.

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And Aaron turned towards Miriam.

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And behold, she was leprous.

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And Aaron said to Moses, 'Oh, my Lord, do not punish us because of what we have

171
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 done foolishly and have sinned.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 Let her be as one dead whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 mother's womb.'

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And Moses cried to the Lord, 'Oh, Lord, please heal her.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Please.'

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 But the Lord said to Moses, 'If her father had but spit on her face,

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 should she not be ashamed seven days, let her be shut outside the camp seven

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 days.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 And after that, she may be brought in again.'

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So Miriam was shut outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not set

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 out on the march till Miriam was brought back in again."

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 How many days did Miriam have leprosy?

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Seven days.

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 How many days was she in isolation?

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Seven days outside the camp, isolated.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 That was the command of the Lord.

187
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Some people called this disease back then the touch of God because it was the touch

188
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 of God that gave the disease, and it is the touch of God that can take away this

189
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 disease.

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Back then, leprosy, same sort of symptoms, dry, patchy, crusty patches of skin.

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 However, back then, they didn't go to a doctor for a diagnosis.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And why was that?

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Because they believed this was not just a physical problem.

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 This was a spiritual problem.

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 What did Miriam do?

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 What was her sin?

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 What did she do?

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 What did she do?

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 Should we read it again?

200
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Should we read it again?

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 She spoke against Moses, God's servant.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 So back then, they thought it was a spiritual disease.

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 If you were gossiping, if you were speaking condemnation against people,

204
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 the disease would come out through your skin.

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 That was their belief back then, okay?

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And this was evident through Miriam.

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 Miriam.

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 And so what happened?

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 What was the result?

210
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Nowadays, we can take medicine and get a cure for leprosy.

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Back then, it resulted in a loss of your job.

212
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 No more teaching.

213
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 No more dentistry.

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 No more finance.

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 No more computer science.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 No more law.

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 No more student.

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Loss of your job.

219
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 You lose your family.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 You're isolated from the camp.

221
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Not just seven days.

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Okay?

223
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Not just seven days.

224
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 There's a special place in Israel for these people.

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 A contamination place.

226
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Quarantine place.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Who liked quarantine?

228
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Who did 21--okay, Julian likes quarantine.

229
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Who did seven days of quarantine?

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Who did seven days of quarantine?

231
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 How was it?

232
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 It was okay?

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Survivable?

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 Torture in Shijin?

235
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 Yeah?

236
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Okay.

237
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 Okay, no windows.

238
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 They closed--okay.

239
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 You didn't get a room with a window?

240
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Okay.

241
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 They didn't want people to see freedom.

242
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 It's actually better, I think, because I got a big window,

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 and I saw people running, jumping, playing basketball,

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 and I was just like, "Five more days.

245
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Four more days."

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 Playing basketball with the wall.

247
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 Football with the wall.

248
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 Kicking it against the wall.

249
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 Who did 14 days?

250
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 14 days was okay?

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Survivable?

252
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 21 days.

253
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Wow, these guys.

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 These guys.

255
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 21 days.

256
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 How was it in isolation?

257
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Oh, you had your wife.

258
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 It might be worse.

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 For Sandra, not for you.

260
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Okay, they had a huge place.

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 They could run around, do laps.

262
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Five at Pulong's, okay.

263
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Imagine leprosy, quarantine.

264
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Not just seven days, not just 14 days.

265
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Knowing that you had a hope that you would get out.

266
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 21 days, at least you're working towards that last day.

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 There's hope that you would get out.

268
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Leprosy?

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Did people really have a hope?

270
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 They didn't.

271
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 And as things got worse and worse,

272
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 from patches of your skin to losing your fingers

273
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 to losing your feet to not being able to see,

274
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 to not being able to breathe, to losing your nose,

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 was hope getting stronger and stronger?

276
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 It wasn't.

277
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 It was getting worse.

278
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Despair.

279
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Isolation.

280
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 Loneliness.

281
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 And it says here that the priest was to examine them

282
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 for dull spots.

283
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 And what would happen?

284
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 If the priest saw that they had leprosy,

285
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 they would be forced to go out, outside to the camp.

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 You can read Leviticus 13 for the details.

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And also, not only were you to have isolation from society,

288
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 it says in verse 45, let's read 45 together.

289
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
 Can we go to 45?

290
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Ready?

291
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 One, two, three.

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Anyone with such a defiling disease must wear torn clothes,

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 left their hair be unkept, cover the lower part of their face,

294
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 and cry out, unclean, unclean.

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 As they have the disease, they remain unclean.

296
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 They must live alone.

297
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 They must live outside the camp.

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 Imagine when you had COVID.

299
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 You had to cry, unclean, unclean, on the MTR.

300
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 How would it be?

301
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Everybody would run away, right?

302
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Okay.

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 This is what lepers had to do when they stepped out of their quarantine zone.

304
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 And they were amongst people that were clean.

305
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 They had to cry out, unclean, unclean, like a sign.

306
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 I'm diseased. I'm unclean.

307
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Beware.

308
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 Beware.

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 And so this man in this story where he approached Jesus,

310
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 he begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."

311
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 Have you ever begged for something?

312
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 You were so desperate for something.

313
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Maybe it's your child that is sick, and you're so desperate.

314
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 I remember in Canada, it was like -30 one day, -40 sometimes,

315
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 and our heater broke.

316
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 And our heater broke, and I started to develop a fever.

317
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 Okay?

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 And you know what my mom did?

319
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 My mom was like, "Come and fix the heater now!

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 My son is sick!

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 She's just like fighting for me!"

322
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 You know?

323
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Like, I was going to die from fever in -40.

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 She was just so desperate for her child, for me.

325
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 Have you ever been desperate for something?

326
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 So desperate.

327
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Maybe it's your exam marks.

328
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 So desperate.

329
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 God, help me to get this mark so I can go to university.

330
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Maybe it's for a job.

331
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 Maybe it's for a relationship.

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Have you been so desperate?

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 This was this man.

334
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 So desperate.

335
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 In a parallel passage in Luke, it says this.

336
00:17:41,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Luke was a doctor.

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 His diagnosis, covered in leprosy.

338
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 Possibly, he's in the late stages of his life.

339
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 He's desperate.

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 Covered with leprosy.

341
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 He came in desperation.

342
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 He came in violation.

343
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 He's violating the laws of Moses.

344
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 In Leviticus 13, it says, "You should live outside the camp."

345
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 In Leviticus 13, it says, "You should cry unclean."

346
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Unclean, unclean, unclean.

347
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 When you see people that are clean and you're approaching them,

348
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 he is living in violation.

349
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 And lastly, he's seeking compassion.

350
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 Can you imagine five years of quarantine?

351
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Without windows.

352
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 It's very bad.

353
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 It's very bad.

354
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Could it be 20 years in isolation?

355
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 I can't imagine it.

356
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 This person, what is this?

357
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 In his late stages.

358
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 We don't know how many years or how much time exactly.

359
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 He pleads to Jesus, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."

360
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 It shows us that this leper had heard about Jesus.

361
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 In Mark, he had healed.

362
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 In Mark, he had cast out demons.

363
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 So possibly he had heard about these healings.

364
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 He had heard about the casting out of demons.

365
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 In the video, we heard that this man say, the leper say,

366
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 "Oh, I heard about what you did at the wedding.

367
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 You turned water into wine.

368
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 The healings.

369
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 That's how I know of you."

370
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Did Jesus approach this person with fear?

371
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 Was he fearful?

372
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 The disciples were, right?

373
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 "Don't breathe the air.

374
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Run away.

375
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 Step back."

376
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Right?

377
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 They approached with fear.

378
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 This man was unclean, diseased, an outcast, in isolation.

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 And Jesus decides to heal him by touching.

380
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Jesus could have healed by any way.

381
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Spoken, sang, be healed.

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 He could have healed by sending a letter or whatever.

383
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 He could have done anything, right?

384
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Email, a text, you're healed.

385
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Don't worry.

386
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I'm willing.

387
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 LOL.

388
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 Not LOL.

389
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 But Jesus chooses to heal by touch to a person who is untouchable.

390
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Untouchable.

391
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 From unclean, he was made clean.

392
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 From disease, there was healing.

393
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 From an outcast, for the first time, there was acceptance.

394
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 From isolation, he revealed his presence to this person.

395
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 This man was seeking physical healing.

396
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And not only did Jesus give him physically healing,

397
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 ultimately he would give spiritual healing.

398
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 The healing of his soul.

399
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 An untouchable person was touched by an extraordinary man named Jesus.

400
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 And his touch infected the leper.

401
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 The most infectious person in this story is not the leper.

402
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Who is it?

403
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 It's Jesus.

404
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Jesus is the most infectious person.

405
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 His love, his healing, his touch, his presence, his words,

406
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 he is the most infectious person in this story.

407
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 Have you thought about that?

408
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Jesus is amazing.

409
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 His spiritual touch.

410
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 And then Jesus says to him, let's continue and finish the story here.

411
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 One, two, three.

412
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning.

413
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 See that you don't tell this to anyone.

414
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 But go, show yourself to the priest,

415
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing

416
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 as a testimony to them.

417
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 Continue.

418
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Instead, he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news.

419
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 As a result, Jesus could no longer enter the town openly

420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 and stayed outside in lonely places.

421
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.

422
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 So Jesus wasn't like, oh, go share, you know, because his time had not come.

423
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 His time had not come.

424
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And if you continue to read in the Gospels, you'll see why.

425
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 But Jesus tells him, interestingly, to obey the law of Moses.

426
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 And the law of Moses says this in Leviticus 14.

427
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 The priest is to go outside the camp and examine the person who has leprosy.

428
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 If they have been healed of their defiling skin disease,

429
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 the priest shall order two live, clean birds

430
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop

431
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 be brought before the person to be cleansed.

432
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed

433
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 over fresh water in a clay pot.

434
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 He is then to take the live bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood,

435
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 the scarlet yarn, and the hyssop, into the blood of the bird

436
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 that was killed over fresh water.

437
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 Seven times shall he sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the defiling disease

438
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 and pronounce them clean.

439
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 After that, he is to release the live bird in the open fields.

440
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 What does this sound like?

441
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Two birds, and then you have a piece of cedar wood,

442
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 hyssop, and then scarlet yarn.

443
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 Scarlet yarn, what color was scarlet yarn usually?

444
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Red. Scarlet yarn, red.

445
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Let's see the next picture.

446
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 A bird tied to cedar wood with scarlet yarn,

447
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 and hyssop is used for cleaning.

448
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 What do you think it represents?

449
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 It represents Jesus, what Jesus did for us on the cross.

450
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 He took the punishment.

451
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 He paid the price so that the other bird could go free.

452
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 It's so symbolic of what Jesus had done.

453
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 He tells the man, "Go and make a sacrifice,"

454
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 because this actually foreshadows what I'm doing on earth.

455
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Not just healing people physically,

456
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 but ultimately healing people spiritually.

457
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Today, this weekend is Father's Day.

458
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 This is a picture of me and my parents.

459
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 We were in Japan.

460
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 Obviously, my dad's a Messi fan.

461
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 Although he did not jump out of the stadium to hug Messi

462
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 like somebody in China did yesterday,

463
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 there was some YouTube video of that.

464
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 I remember a time when I was a child.

465
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Everybody has been a child.

466
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 I remember a time when I was a child.

467
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 I was at church, and my dad is a pastor.

468
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 There were huge expectations.

469
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 "Pastor's kid, you've got to be perfect,"

470
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 the second coming of Jesus.

471
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Joking.

472
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 That's what somebody actually said to me, though.

473
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 I'm very active.

474
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 I'm competitive.

475
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 When I was a kid, I was also the same and energetic.

476
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 Somehow, we were playing shooting rubber bands.

477
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Somehow, I was really good at it.

478
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 I lit up this guy like he was Christmas.

479
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 He had some bruises from rubber bands.

480
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 We were pretending we were doing CS.

481
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 There was no CS back then.

482
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 I'm just using a modern-day example.

483
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 We were pretending we were playing Counter-Strike,

484
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 just shooting each other.

485
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 Because there were some marks on him from rubber bands,

486
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 his sister got mad.

487
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 His sister was like, "What am I going to tell my parents?

488
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 I brought you to church for the first time,

489
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 and you got lit up by the pastor's kid."

490
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 I remember going back to the house,

491
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 and my parents explaining this to me.

492
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 I was hiding in a dark room.

493
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 I'm also very good at hiding.

494
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 What do you mean?

495
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 This guy, naughty.

496
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 I was hiding because I was like, "Oh, no.

497
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 I don't know if my parents will love me.

498
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 I don't know if the church will accept me."

499
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 These are things that come in a pastor's kid's head.

500
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 "I don't know.

501
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Maybe this person will never go to church again,

502
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 and I've spiritually condemned them for the rest of my life."

503
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 These are some of the thoughts that go through your head

504
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 as a pastor's kid.

505
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 I remember I was hiding,

506
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 and finally my parents realized I was gone,

507
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 and they were crying out, "Johnny, Johnny, where are you?"

508
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 I was behind the door of this room,

509
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 and when my dad stepped in, I pushed him.

510
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 I pushed him.

511
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 I was like, "Leave me alone."

512
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 I was like, "You don't want me anymore."

513
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 You know what my dad said?

514
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 You know what my dad said?

515
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 My dad said, "When did I ever say that I didn't want you?"

516
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 When he said that, I knew I was accepted.

517
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 I was loved.

518
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 I did something wrong, not really knowing,

519
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 but I knew my dad loved me.

520
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 That is what Jesus is.

521
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 That is what the story of the prodigal son is.

522
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 Each one of us have done something wrong.

523
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 Each one of us have something wrong with us.

524
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Maybe we're broken.

525
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Maybe we're lost.

526
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 Maybe we're struggling to find meaning.

527
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 Maybe we have a physical illness.

528
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 Maybe we have a mental illness.

529
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Each of us are broken in our own way.

530
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 Just like that prodigal son's father,

531
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 he is waiting at the doorstep for us to return.

532
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 Maybe you've been struggling with something.

533
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 I don't know what it is.

534
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 Something you've done, something you're going through.

535
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 God knows what you're going through.

536
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 "When did I ever say I didn't want you?"

537
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 God never said that.

538
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 It was my own lie in my head.

539
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 "They'll never want me.

540
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 They'll kick me out.

541
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 I'll have to run away."

542
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 God never said that.

543
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 "When did I ever say I didn't want you?"

544
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 Is there anywhere in the Bible that says that?

545
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 No.

546
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 God is a God of love.

547
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 He knows our need.

548
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 He knows our situation.

549
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 And in the last song that we're going to sing tonight,

550
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 the chorus says this.

551
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 "I run to the Father.

552
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 I step into grace.

553
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 I'm done with the hiding.

554
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 No reason to wait.

555
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 My heart needs a surgeon.

556
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 My soul needs a friend.

557
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 So I'll run to the Father again and again and again."

558
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 Let me just pray for us.

559
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Let's just close our eyes.

560
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 Is there anybody right now tonight that's just going through something,

561
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 going through a struggle?

562
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 They're feeling lost.

563
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 They're feeling broken.

564
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 They're feeling isolated like that leper.

565
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 And they're in need of a touch, not just any touch but a spiritual touch,

566
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 a touch that only Jesus can provide.

567
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Jesus, the most infectious person in the world, with his love,

568
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 he wants to consume you with his love, with his acceptance, with his grace.

569
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 Let us come and run to the Father.

570
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Let us be known by him.

571
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Father, I pray for each one of us.

572
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 We're all broken, lost in some way.

573
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 We need your healing, not just once but a constant healing.

574
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 We thank you that you know our need, you know what we're going through,

575
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 and that you are willing, and that you have already paid the ultimate price.

576
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 We thank you, Jesus.

577
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 And the church said, "Amen."

578
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Let us stand.

579
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
