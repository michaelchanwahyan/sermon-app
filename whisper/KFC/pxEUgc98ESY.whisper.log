[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340]   - Hey everyone.
[00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:09.000]   So, look at you all.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.640]   We actually get to be together.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.480]   Isn't it good?
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.720]   I think nothing warms my heart more than being able
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.620]   to just see the body of Christ get together.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.520]   A couple of weeks ago I went on a spiritual retreat
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.020]   and I started in Causeway Bay.
[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.860]   But then there was just so many people.
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.980]   Causeway Bay, I actually usually hate Causeway Bay.
[00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.820]   I thought it would be okay,
[00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.200]   but Hong Kong's been getting busy again.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.980]   So, after a few hours I was like,
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.280]   you know what, I can't do it.
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.120]   I can't do it here.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.700]   There's too many people.
[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.460]   And I'm beginning to be reminded
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.240]   of my distaste for crowds, for people.
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.480]   And so I went all the way to Stanley
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.000]   and then I caught a ferry to Potoi.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.680]   Potoi, where there were no people.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.260]   Actually, no, there were lots of people on the ferry.
[00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.160]   But once you got there, we got to Despond.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160]   And I remember walking around there.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.040]   And it's a really nice island
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.860]   that doesn't have its own running water or power,
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.920]   but it's really cool.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.760]   Do go.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.740]   I remember just finally getting to a spot
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.440]   where I could just see the ocean and the mountains.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.520]   And I remember telling God,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.440]   ah, now I'm in beauty.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.240]   Now I can really get to rest.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.600]   If only those people over there
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.040]   would just move out of the way
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.060]   and I would be able to take the most beautiful picture.
[00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.680]   But those humans are getting in the way.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.600]   And then that's when God spoke to me.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.680]   And it was the only time he spoke to me
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.520]   during those two days.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.720]   And he said, you know,
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.120]   those humans are the most beautiful thing in this picture.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.000]   They're made in the image of me.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.840]   So you can sort yourself out
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.200]   and change your mindset quickly
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.600]   because the most beautiful place on earth is Causeway Bay.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.180]   Because that's where all the people are.
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.520]   And then by extension, Hong Kong.
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.800]   Requires a change of heart.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   So it warms my heart to see all you beautiful people,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.480]   and John, of course, and...
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.720]   But nothing warms my heart even more than that,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.280]   than actually going through the word of God.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.400]   And today we're going through 2 Peter.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.840]   John started us last week on the sermon series,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.360]   Beware, but Grow.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.960]   And today I'm doing 2 Peter, chapter two.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.080]   But just a little context,
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.200]   just to rewind it back a little bit.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.840]   The apostle Peter writes these two letters to the church.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.760]   He writes one Peter about AD 64.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.060]   And then that one is all about,
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.280]   actually we've done this before.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.560]   It's all about, it's all about comfort
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.000]   and encouragement to the church
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.880]   because they were going through external attacks.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.940]   So Peter was saying, just hang on there, suffering.
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.600]   You'll get there, there'll be hope.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.800]   And that's what one Peter was about.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.000]   And then three years later, he writes 2 Peter.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.680]   2 Peter has a very, very different angle.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.520]   Instead of talking about external attacks,
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.760]   he's now warning about internal attacks.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.920]   So if the one Peter,
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.240]   the main theme of that is encouragement,
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.240]   2 Peter is about warning.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.160]   It's about warning.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.500]   And today I'm gonna be talking on the title examination.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.160]   Examination, I don't know how,
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.480]   what that word does to you,
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.280]   what emotions it conjures up,
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.720]   whether you feel good about examinations
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.800]   because it allows you to prove how much you know,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.200]   whether you're good or whether
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.480]   maybe physical examination's bad
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.600]   'cause you're worried about what it might reveal.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.560]   The word examination.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.140]   But you know, as I was thinking about this
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.280]   and looking at the sermon title,
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.280]   I was wondering how often do we examine our faith?
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.680]   How often do we examine our theology?
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.680]   How often do we examine our lives?
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.660]   2 Peter is talking about this in chapter two.
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.680]   And it's not a very nice chapter.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.100]   I, you know what, I don't think you'll meet anyone
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.180]   who thinks 2 Peter two is their favorite chapter
[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.020]   in the Bible.
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.960]   I have no friends who like that chapter.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.360]   In fact, if there is someone,
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.240]   I don't think I'd want to be their friend.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.160]   2 Peter two isn't a passage of scripture
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.940]   where children will learn in Sunday school to memorize.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.780]   It's not like that.
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.600]   But I want to take us there today
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   because it is oh so important.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.520]   And it's interesting, it starts off,
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.540]   but false prophets also arose among the people
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.480]   just as there will be false teachers among you
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.120]   who will secretly bring in destructive heresies,
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.300]   even denying the master.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.680]   It's interesting because Peter here
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.600]   is talking about false prophets.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.360]   And it wasn't that long ago when he was following a guy
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.280]   who was warning about false prophets.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.560]   In Matthew 24, Jesus himself was telling Peter
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.640]   and the people that were there,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.100]   there will be false prophets.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.440]   And when that happens,
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.860]   when people are starting to spread false teaching,
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.320]   that is when the followers,
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.440]   their love for me will grow cold, Matthew 24.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.880]   And now we fast forward.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.960]   Peter himself is saying the very same words.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.760]   Beware, there are false prophets among you.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.000]   This is an internal thing, false prophets among you.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.520]   And they are going to bring about destructive heresies,
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.640]   even denying the master.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.760]   This is chapter two, verse one,
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.920]   if you want to follow in your scripture.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.160]   I think they'll come up on the slides as well.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.440]   They will be denying the master,
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.800]   bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.460]   Brothers and sisters, how often do you protect yourself
[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.160]   or examine yourself and examine your heart and your mind
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.640]   against destructive heresies?
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.560]   Sounds pretty hardcore, right?
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.000]   Sounds pretty deep.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.480]   Maybe not something that we think about.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.320]   Maybe not something that we are generally used
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.680]   to talking about in church.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.440]   And if you just have a glance at 2 Peter chapter two,
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.720]   now you can do on your phone, you can just scroll through.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.360]   At first glance, this chapter doesn't seem
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.440]   to have much to do with us at all.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.200]   In fact, it's not something that we like to talk about
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.240]   'cause it doesn't make us warm and fuzzy.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.740]   It's just a hard to read, hard to understand passage.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.900]   But that's the first glance.
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.340]   But if you dig deeper, there are actually so many truths
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.120]   here that apply to us today.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.900]   But as I look at this chapter, all 22 verses of it,
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.460]   we must at least have a glance at this.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.380]   So what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go through this
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.380]   very quickly just to show you what Peter is talking about.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.500]   So feel free to follow.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.740]   The slides will be up there as well.
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.380]   So verse one, but false prophets, they will be there.
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.940]   And then they'll bring in destruction,
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.600]   destructive heresies, denying the master, denying Jesus.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.720]   And they will bring upon themselves swift destruction.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.760]   Verse two, and many will follow their sensuality.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.000]   Because of them, the way of truth will be blasphemed.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.200]   So it's not just a truth that you can have in your mind,
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.960]   but there is a way of truth.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.760]   That means when you have truth in your mind,
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.640]   you may believe the right thing.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.720]   But if it doesn't drop down into the way you live,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.680]   then it's still not good enough.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.460]   There is a way of truth that has been blasphemed.
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.380]   And verse three, and in their greed,
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.500]   they will exploit you with false words.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.060]   In their greed, their condemnation for long ago
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.620]   is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.660]   He's saying they will face condemnation.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.700]   They will face judgment.
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.340]   Then he goes on in verse four,
[00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.780]   and he gives three examples.
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.340]   Three examples of how people who have strayed away,
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.900]   who have followed false heresies,
[00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.380]   or who have led others astray, what their fate will be.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.000]   The first example is, "For God," verse four,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.240]   "For if God did not spare angels when they sinned,"
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.180]   who's he talking about?
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.100]   Likely scholars believe he's talking about Genesis 6,
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.960]   when the sons of God, angels,
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.440]   found the daughters of man attractive,
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.140]   and seeped into mankind, and brought about sin
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.600]   into the world, or furthered sin into the world.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.440]   That was one example.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.720]   Number two were the, verse five,
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.900]   "He did not spare the ancient world,"
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.960]   the people who were around when Noah was around,
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.880]   the people who didn't believe in God,
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.920]   who were so wicked that God saw and said,
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.000]   "We need to start over."
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.600]   But there is a righteous man, Noah,
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.880]   a herald of righteousness, a teacher of righteousness.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.480]   So those are the second people he didn't spare.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.860]   And then the third, verse six,
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.320]   "If by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes."
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.560]   So you see here, the three different examples,
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.000]   the angels, the ancient people from Noah's time,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.800]   and the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.240]   He's saying here, these people weren't spared.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.440]   They met their destruction.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:12.280]   The false heresies led them down a path
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.080]   that eventually led to their demise.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.360]   But he also rescues those who follow the truth.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   Noah is an example, and verse seven, Lot.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.420]   Both examples of the fact that if you remain righteous,
[00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.920]   if you don't follow the ways of the wicked,
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.000]   then God will save you.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.160]   And then he carries on in verse 10,
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.340]   and he starts to describe these people,
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.040]   these false prophets, these false teachers.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.720]   They're bold and they're willful.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.320]   Verse 12, "They're like irrational animals,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.320]   "creatures of instinct."
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.000]   This is just really painting a terrible picture.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.080]   Verse 14, "They have eyes full of adultery,
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.700]   "insatiable for sin.
[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.860]   "They entice unsteady souls.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.320]   "They have hearts trained in greed."
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.960]   They have eyes full of adultery.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.520]   Whoever they see in the streets,
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.560]   whoever they see anywhere,
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.440]   all they're thinking about is adultery, is about sin,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.320]   is about sexual immorality.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.640]   Their hearts are insatiable for sin.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.080]   They are trained, their hearts are trained in greed.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.120]   The word trained there is the same train
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.560]   that the Apostle Paul uses when he talks about
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.480]   in 1 Corinthians 9, disciplining your body,
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:20.060]   training it to do what it should.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.420]   There's an almost expertise in it.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.680]   There's a diligence, there's a perseverance
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.480]   in training for greed.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:29.160]   Verse 15, "Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.560]   "They followed the way of Balaam,
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.120]   "who loved gain from wrongdoing."
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.840]   The story of Balaam is very interesting
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.640]   'cause it ended up being a donkey,
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.320]   a donkey that had to speak to him.
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.720]   And we'll talk about that a little bit later.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.040]   Verse 17, "These are waterless springs
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.660]   "and mists driven by a storm."
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.360]   These are springs where from afar you think they're good.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.800]   So you walk towards them to get drinks,
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.360]   but then you realize they are waterless.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.200]   "They promise a lot, but deliver nothing."
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.280]   And that is what he's saying here.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.420]   Verse 19, "They promise them freedom,
[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.600]   "but they themselves are slaves of corruption.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.120]   "For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved."
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.560]   These people, they make big promises.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.980]   "Hey, come and do this, you'll enjoy it, you deserve it.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.680]   "I can give you this, but soon those promises come empty."
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.320]   Verse 21, "For it would have been better for them
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.340]   "never to have known the way of righteousness."
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.080]   Because it's worse because they know the truth now.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.920]   So what they're doing is they're turning away from the truth
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.800]   that Hebrews talks about, it's in Hebrews 6,
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.460]   that they're crucifying Christ again.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:33.280]   And that is just a worse state than we were in before.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.080]   And finally, verse 22, "Just like a dog
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.080]   "who returns to its own vomit."
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.920]   It's disgusting.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.600]   For those of us who have dogs,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.880]   and my dog, Walter, has been vomiting his food recently,
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.920]   it's pretty disgusting.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.640]   But that is what he's describing here.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.440]   These false prophets, these people
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.800]   who are enticing and steady souls.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.160]   That is what it looks like.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.520]   It's a grim passage, right?
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.600]   It's a grim passage, and even at first glance,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.080]   it does not really look that fun.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.000]   But the question that I really had is,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.080]   I don't think I have destructive heresies in my life.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:08.920]   Surely not.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.040]   Wait, do I?
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.280]   Are there things in my life that have actually caused me
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.880]   to blaspheme the way of truth?
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.360]   And that's the question I wanted to ask you guys is,
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.720]   are there any destructive heresies in your lives?
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.360]   Are there things that you have bought into,
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.320]   that you have believed in, which actually are not true,
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.280]   and actually have caused you to go astray?
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.360]   And we look here at scripture,
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.600]   and we see all these very, very, very serious things,
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.560]   all these terrible things that people are doing.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.520]   And then we look, oh, they're so bad.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.760]   We're not like that at all.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.000]   But then I look, and I'm thinking,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.600]   I don't know, I think a lot of these things
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.800]   exist right now, right?
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.720]   We see them in society right now.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.240]   And as I was looking at this passage of scripture,
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.880]   I was also influenced by the book I've been reading,
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.480]   which is actually a book by Richard Foster
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.240]   called "Money, Sex, and Power."
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.240]   And I realized this chapter two is basically talking
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.640]   about the battle with money, sex, and power.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.680]   So you may think that you do not have
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.120]   any destructive heresies in your life.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.600]   And I may think that, but my goodness,
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.800]   I think we all battle with money, sex, and power
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.720]   to some degree.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.720]   There's a pastor in town recently emailed me
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.480]   and just talking about just the situation in Hong Kong,
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.760]   this city itself.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.960]   And he mentioned those three key words again this week.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.000]   He was like, those are the three things
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.200]   that really chain this city down.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.920]   And nowhere else in the world will you see
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.760]   these three things at play the most.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.560]   And verse one there where he's saying
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.240]   they're even denying the master.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.280]   These are the three things that cause followers of Christ
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.000]   to deny their master.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.040]   My question to all of us today is,
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.920]   are any of those three things affecting you?
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.640]   Money, sex, and power.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.240]   It's interesting, but let's rewind a little bit
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.560]   and talk about the word heresy.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.920]   What does the word heresy actually mean?
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.760]   What is a heretic?
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.000]   Now, usually it's to do with the Christian faith.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.200]   So I think I'll get a definition.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.480]   Belief or opinion contrary to Orthodox Christian faith.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:25.120]   A false view of ultimate reality.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.200]   That leads to destruction.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.680]   An opinion held by someone
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.640]   that is against the core tenets of the faith.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.760]   That is a heresy.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.120]   And I think the three that I want to address briefly today
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.840]   are money, sex, and power.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.360]   It's gonna be one of those sermons.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.920]   And I really battled with God for a long time about this.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.840]   Because actually we don't talk about these things.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.800]   Someone recently told me last week,
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.840]   the church doesn't talk about money.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.960]   We don't have to talk about money.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.400]   And actually, you pastors don't have any money,
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.600]   so you don't even know how to talk about money.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.720]   Which is so true.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.760]   And I'm like, yeah, so I'm not qualified
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.680]   to talk about money.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.640]   But yet, it's the biggest thing that holds us back.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.800]   And they're all linked.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.280]   They're all intertwined.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.120]   People use money to buy sex.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.920]   People use sex to get money.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.760]   People use money to buy more power.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.600]   And then to have power, to then get more money.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.960]   These are all linked.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.320]   And they are all so, so serious.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.560]   But I would also say that they're not supposed to be bad.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.360]   In fact, in their proper place,
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.040]   in our Christian life, in our Christian way,
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.600]   that actually they can be used for enormous, enormous good.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.160]   I was speaking to a banker recently
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.920]   who is a follower of Jesus.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.560]   And he was saying, you know, as bankers,
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.840]   we get paid way too much.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.480]   And I was like, you know what?
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.680]   This might be bordering heresy.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.880]   I don't agree with that.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.240]   Actually, if you're a follower of Jesus,
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.200]   I don't think you can be paid too much.
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.640]   You are entrusted with a lot.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.320]   God has chosen to give you X amount of money
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.080]   for you to use, for you to steward.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.360]   So I don't think you can be paid too much, technically.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.360]   It all depends on the matter of the heart.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.640]   And actually, we were singing about revivals.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:20.560]   We were singing about revivals,
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.120]   and I realized in the history of the church,
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.160]   spiritual revivals have often come
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.520]   when there have been bold and clear responses
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:29.960]   to these three things, money, sex, and power.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.520]   If we are seeking revival,
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.360]   if we are nearing revival on the verge of it,
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.880]   we need to address these three things
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.840]   because these are the three strongholds in our lives,
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.760]   in this city, in our churches.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.240]   And that's what Peter's talking about here.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.120]   These things are happening within the church.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.320]   And we've seen recent prominent pastors
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.360]   fall to this very thing.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.040]   So no one is exempt.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.600]   So why aren't we talking about it?
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.840]   Now, this sermon is not gonna be able
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.880]   to cover all three of those issues at length,
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.840]   but I wanted to at least start this conversation.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.600]   I wanted to at least bring this up to the surface.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.920]   And if there is anything that's happening in our lives,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.720]   then we need to find the right people
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.160]   and the right places and the right times
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.000]   to talk about these things, money, sex, and power.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.760]   And I wanted to start with the first one, money.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.000]   Verse three, "And in their greed,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.720]   "they will exploit you with false words."
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.040]   In their greed, they will exploit you,
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.080]   they will manipulate you, they will lie for personal gain.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:34.200]   And then verse 15, what I talked about earlier,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.760]   "They have hearts trained in greed."
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.560]   They're trained, they're experts in it,
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.120]   experts in accumulating things,
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.720]   personal gain, possessions, wealth, experts.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.040]   I think we in Hong Kong have so many experts
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.080]   in accumulating wealth.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:53.920]   I've never ever seen so many wealthy people
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.320]   other than in Hong Kong.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.840]   But then I've also seen so many generous people.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.800]   So now how do we find that balance?
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.040]   It's all about the change of heart.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.040]   And then he gives a strange example, Balaam, verse 15.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.800]   "They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor,
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.800]   "who loved gain from wrongdoing,
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.600]   "but was rebuked for his own transgression.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.440]   "A speechless donkey spoke with human voice
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.760]   "and restrained the prophet's madness."
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.720]   A speechless donkey starts to speak.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.480]   Have you heard that story?
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.600]   It's a peculiar story.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.520]   So Balaam is actually a very prominent prophet
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.040]   in Jewish culture.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.600]   And he was a prophet that was approached by a foreign king,
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.880]   the king of Moab, Balak.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:40.280]   And then Balak wanted Balaam to curse Israel
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.640]   because this king of Moab was getting scared.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.440]   The Israelites were starting to gain power.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.400]   They were starting to move into the Promised Land.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.360]   And so this king was like, "We need to sort this out.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.080]   "We need to preempt their attack.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.200]   "Let's find a prophet to send a curse onto them."
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.760]   So Balaam, and to Balaam, this very renowned prophet,
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.200]   hears a message from the king of Moab.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.640]   And what does he do?
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   What does scripture tell us to do here?
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.520]   He sells out.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.400]   For personal gain, he ends up selling out.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.080]   Now it's interesting how he does it.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.560]   So when he hears this message from Balak,
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:14.440]   he then travels.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.280]   And how does he travel?
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.000]   He travels on a donkey, and he travels to Moab,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.360]   hoping to meet this king,
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.680]   eventually to basically work with him
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.720]   and partner with him
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.720]   in bringing down the destruction of the Israelites.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.920]   But as he's going on the path, his donkey stops.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.560]   His donkey stops and doesn't want to carry on again.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.320]   And so Balaam's like, "What's going on?"
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.240]   In reality, the donkey could see an angel
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.000]   right in front of them, so he couldn't walk through.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.840]   So he stops.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.160]   But then Balaam rebukes the donkey, beats the donkey,
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.360]   and then the donkey tries to squeeze on and carry on.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.480]   And then he goes a little further,
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.880]   and then the donkey is stuck between a war
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.600]   and something else, and he stops again.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.120]   And then Balaam's like, "Why are you stopping?"
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.640]   But again, the angel of the Lord is there.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.840]   And then so Balaam beats his donkey again.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.520]   And then he does it again.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.840]   And eventually, the donkey speaks out.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.400]   And the donkey says, "Don't you know that I've been faithful
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.120]   and loyal to you all this time?
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.560]   Why are you beating me?"
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.240]   And then at that moment, the angel reveals himself.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.920]   And Balaam is rebuked and convicted.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.960]   And so you'd think that'd be the end of the story,
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.800]   but he doesn't.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.800]   Actually, he tries to then work his way around it.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.760]   Instead of giving a curse, he still wanted the money.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.080]   So he got to meet Balak, the king of Moab,
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.960]   and he said, "I can't give a curse.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.520]   Whatever God blesses, I cannot curse."
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.800]   So time and time again, he resists,
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.840]   but then he tries to find a loophole.
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.320]   Eventually, what does he do?
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.440]   He tells the people of Moab,
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.040]   "I'll tell you how you can bring about curse on Israel
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.320]   without me having to do it and me getting into trouble.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.560]   I'll tell you what you do.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.040]   You introduce women into their culture, into their society.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.760]   You seduce them, and you will bring about the curse
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.600]   that way."
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.840]   He did this for personal gain.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.120]   Money, sex, and power, all those thousands of years ago,
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.120]   the same issues that we deal with today.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.200]   Money.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.840]   Money is one of the key destructive heresies.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.240]   Martin Luther said this,
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.360]   "There are three conversions when someone
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.360]   becomes a Christian.
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.160]   There is first a conversion of the heart,
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.720]   then there is a conversion of the mind,
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.640]   and finally the conversion of the purse or the wallet,
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.280]   because where your treasure is there, your heart is also."
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.080]   So my question to all of us is,
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.520]   how much do we struggle with this?
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.880]   How much do we consciously and subconsciously struggle
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.240]   with the issue of money?
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.960]   Jesus talks about money so much and possessions,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.440]   and he says, "You cannot serve both God and money."
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.240]   And the word he uses for money is mamon,
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.000]   which is basically giving it a spiritual,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.320]   personal character.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.360]   He's saying money isn't just this neutral, dead thing.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.080]   It isn't just these coins.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.800]   It isn't just these pieces of paper.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.880]   Money is alive and well.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.360]   It is a rival God seeking to destroy and consume you
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.360]   if you allow it.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.080]   You cannot serve both.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.120]   Sometimes we think money is this neutral thing
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.360]   that always, no, Jesus is saying it is a rival God.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.400]   Keller would call it a counterfeit God.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.000]   It's something that can seek to take over
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.120]   God's place in your life.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.040]   It will cause you to deny your master.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.320]   The apostle Paul tells Timothy,
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.560]   what did he say in 1 Timothy 6?
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.600]   The love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.680]   Not money itself, but the love of money.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.200]   But these days, they seem to be synonymous.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.280]   Money, everyone seems to love money.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:47.480]   We might be in love with money.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:50.360]   And it's the root, not all kinds of evil.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.760]   So it's not all kinds of evil,
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   it's the root of all kinds of evil.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.040]   That doesn't mean that everything evil is caused by money.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.400]   That means that people who want money
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.040]   will stop at no evil to get it.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.880]   It means people who want money will stop at nothing
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.040]   and commit all kinds of evil to get it.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:15.040]   But if redeemed and conquered, it can be used for good.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.320]   We see Jesus and Zacchaeus, the tax collector,
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.200]   who has been cheating his own people for years.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:25.840]   And then he's confronted with Jesus.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.200]   And then he ends up just giving it all back and more.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.960]   And then Jesus declares, "Today salvation has arrived
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.200]   at this house."
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.040]   In Luke 8, you see a story of Jesus.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.400]   Jesus isn't repulsed or repelled by people who are wealthy.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.320]   'Cause money isn't, he doesn't see money in that way.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.960]   He created all things.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.120]   In fact, in Luke 8, we see that he, in his ministry,
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.920]   there were wealthy ladies who actually supported
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.840]   his ministry.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.760]   But that wasn't the thing that he's worried about.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.680]   The thing is, do we fall in love with money?
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.320]   And if we do, then we must repent
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.800]   because this one can destroy you.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:03.520]   And we see it time and time again.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.720]   And maybe in the Chinese culture,
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.800]   the one that hits most close to home is gambling.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.880]   The desire for money can destroy one's life.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.520]   Is that one of the destructive heresies that we have?
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.880]   Because if it is, we need to confess and be healed.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.720]   It is huge.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.200]   And I can say it's a battle that I face every day as well.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:28.240]   How do we cope with, how do we talk about,
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.440]   how do we use money?
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.720]   Money.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.560]   Let's reflect on that and let's surrender everything
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.720]   that we have and allow God to use it
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.440]   in whatever way he desires.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.280]   Money.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:42.680]   Second one, sex.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:47.360]   Verse two, they will follow their sensuality.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.240]   And then verse 10, we see here,
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.520]   and especially those who indulge
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.360]   in the lust of defiling passion.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.720]   And then verse 14, they have eyes full of adultery,
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:02.840]   insatiable for sin, they entice unsteady souls.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.960]   You see, during that time, there was a group of people
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.280]   that were rising in the church that Peter knew about
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.840]   that believed in something very interesting.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.000]   They believed that in order for you to be saved,
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.560]   you needed to have the special knowledge.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.600]   You had to be in the know, maybe the original,
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.960]   the place that was invented, when you know, you know.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.640]   And they were called the Gnostics.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.960]   And they started something called Gnosticism,
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.000]   which is basically this idea of,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.960]   in order to gain salvation, you just,
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.040]   once you know it, you will have salvation.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.080]   And furthermore, how does that play out in your life?
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.360]   Your spiritual life is very much separated
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.680]   from your physical life.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.280]   They're two separate things.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.400]   So what they're saying is, if you know,
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.520]   and you're saved, and your soul is saved,
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.440]   you can do anything you want with your physical life,
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.760]   with your physical body.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.160]   It doesn't affect it, guys.
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.600]   'Cause we, how do you know?
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.200]   'Cause we know.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.480]   And then they would basically say,
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.720]   you can do whatever you want.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.920]   You can follow whatever passions
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.200]   that you have in your flesh.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.120]   You can do it because your soul is saved,
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.120]   because you know.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.120]   And so Peter's saying here, that isn't how it works.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.040]   And he's describing them.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.160]   They have eyes full of adultery.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.720]   Everywhere they go, they're looking at people
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.760]   like animals, wanting to consume.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.560]   And even though that sounds so crazy,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.560]   isn't that what we're filled with here?
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.760]   Just walk down the MTR station.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.080]   What are the adverts that you see surrounding you?
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.880]   What has it become in our mindset, in our life?
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.840]   And is the church trying to address it?
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.640]   That's the question that I'm asking myself.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.040]   Because we know that sex is a very, very good thing.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.600]   In fact, someone said one of the greatest tragedies
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.280]   in church history is the separation
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.240]   of spirituality and sexuality.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:01.400]   It's the greatest tragedy of the separation
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.920]   of spirituality and sexuality.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.240]   God created sex.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.480]   God has such a high view of sexuality.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.280]   For one being to be loving and to be loved
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.480]   and to be known by another being.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.320]   To be willing to give themselves completely,
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.080]   to commit themselves for the whole of their lives.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:26.520]   Sexuality and spirituality are friends, not enemies.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.680]   Yet what we've done is we've twisted it all.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.080]   We have twisted it all to the point where
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.440]   we are now just like the animals.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.040]   God created it to be so, so much more
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.280]   than what we advertise it to be in the MTR stations.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.760]   So, so much more.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.520]   Yet here we are fighting the same things
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.160]   that they fought all those thousands of years ago.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.960]   We, as a body of Christ, need to enlarge
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.160]   our view of sexuality.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.440]   So what we're saying here is those topless bars
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.320]   or pornography or all those adverts,
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.720]   they're not showing sexuality too much.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.280]   They're not showing it enough.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.160]   They've got a low view of sexuality.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.880]   But if we were truly to understand why God created it,
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.200]   then we would have the high view.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.000]   Then we would be able to truly understand
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.040]   what sex was supposed to be.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.640]   We've believed in that destructive heresy
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.720]   and that has taken over our lives.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:28.040]   Brothers, sisters, is sex one of your masters?
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:34.520]   Is it one of the things that are gripping you?
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.520]   If it is, one, you're not alone.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.840]   Two, bring it to God.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.120]   Because God created it and he knows.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.920]   And he calls us to see it as he sees it.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.960]   I rewind back and I think I've got the verse in Genesis.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:57.960]   Adam and Eve were in the garden, naked and unashamed.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.760]   Unashamed.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.760]   Yet somehow, now, we have turned it completely away
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:08.520]   from what it was supposed to be.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.920]   First, money.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.440]   Then, sex.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.640]   And finally, power.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.160]   Secretly bring in destructive heresies, verse one.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.560]   Even denying the master who brought them, verse 10.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.120]   And especially those who indulge in the lust
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.520]   of defiling passion and despise authority.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.360]   They're bold and they're willful, verse 13.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.880]   And 14, and they're enticing and steady souls.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:42.040]   Power is dangerous because power influences
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.000]   our relationships with each other and with God.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.800]   We see it in play in the world right now.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.680]   And again, power itself can be used for good.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.880]   Authority can be used for good.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.360]   Yet, we, once again, have twisted it.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.760]   You see, power can destroy or create.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.840]   It can destroy or create, but it's up to us
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.000]   to decide how we use it.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.960]   Adam and Eve, as I was talking about earlier,
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.840]   they had everything.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.160]   They had everything they could have ever wanted
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.960]   in this perfect Garden of Eden.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.440]   But what was the sin in the Garden of Eden?
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.080]   The sin of power.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.480]   The sin of wanting to take control.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.800]   The sin of wanting more.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.760]   And power's a very interesting thing.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.920]   You may thirst for power, but once you get it,
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.000]   you then want more.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.320]   And it just keeps going, and then it's just a vicious cycle
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.840]   that you can't get out of.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.800]   And that's what we have in this world right now.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.480]   And I was reading recently, the leaders of the free world,
[00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:45.320]   or maybe not even free world, a lot of them,
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.560]   what is the key characteristic that they have?
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.440]   That they are narcissists.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.520]   That they are completely consumed by themselves,
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.600]   and all they want to do is control other people.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.560]   And that isn't the kind of leader that you want.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.440]   Jesus himself displayed what the kind of leader
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.280]   that we want.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.120]   We want a servant king,
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.560]   the one who's willing to give up himself.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.520]   Yet, the way of the world has completely
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.880]   taken us another way.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.080]   And you can see how power can completely destroy lives.
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.520]   And we can see it right before our eyes.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.640]   You need to switch on the news.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.200]   You need to just open up SEMP,
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.760]   and you will see how power destroys our world.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.200]   Power.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.240]   King Saul was destroyed by power.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.400]   But really, it comes back to pride.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.400]   It comes back to pride.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.600]   And what is pride?
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.280]   The one I love the most, the definition of pride is
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.120]   an inaccurate view of oneself.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.120]   And I've talked about this before,
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.560]   because pride and insecurity are really the same thing.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.040]   It's an inaccurate view of oneself.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.480]   Someone who's very prideful,
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.720]   who feels the need to boast about everything,
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.800]   is because they're insecure.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.760]   Someone who is very insecure has forgotten
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.200]   about their actual and accurate perception of themselves.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.120]   So they feel as though they have to do everything
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.040]   on their own.
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.160]   But if we can fight both of those,
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.720]   then we will realize that we are all children of God.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.520]   Children of the most high God, co-heirs with Christ.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.920]   Power starts from pride,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:18.920]   starts from thinking that we need to take credit
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.240]   for something that we don't deserve.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.600]   To have more power than what we're able to handle.
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.840]   And God, I was talking to someone else recently,
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.240]   God hates boasting, right?
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.400]   God absolutely hates boasting.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:34.160]   But the question is, do we boast?
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.440]   For those of you who have children,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.080]   you'll know that sometimes you see your kids
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:42.240]   and they enjoy doing something that they love
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.120]   and they get really good at it,
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.400]   but then they do boast.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.400]   And it's like, you know what?
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.560]   That doesn't look as good.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.240]   That's not a good look.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.480]   When you think that this is all because of you.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.440]   But that's what we do, right?
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.200]   In our quest for power, we reveal our pride.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.280]   We reveal our insecurities.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.480]   And what does scripture say in Proverbs 16?
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.200]   Pride is the thing that comes before the destruction
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.360]   or before the fall.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:11.880]   It is us forgetting who we actually are,
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:14.000]   that we don't need to fight for significance.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.760]   We don't need to fight for relevance
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.120]   because we already are because of Jesus.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.960]   Money, sex and power.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.720]   You see, these destructive heresies,
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.760]   they cause us to blaspheme the way, the truth.
[00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.360]   And all of these issues, these three big three issues
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.600]   come down to one thing.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.680]   It's on the next slide.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.600]   Have we denied him as our master?
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.320]   Brothers and sisters, I just wanna spend a few minutes now
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.400]   before I finish up.
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.120]   Examine your life.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.760]   Examine your heart.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.560]   Examine the way that you live.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.160]   Who is the master there?
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.200]   If someone looked at your life
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.120]   and followed you 24/7 for one week,
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.760]   what conclusion would they come to
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.480]   in terms of who is the master?
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:14.080]   Would they see that actually money
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:16.720]   is the thing that controls you the most?
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.320]   Is the thing that drives you to,
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.640]   is the thing that gets you up in the morning?
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.200]   Of course, realistically it is
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.000]   'cause it's the thing that causes us to go to work.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.440]   But does it consume you to an unhealthy level?
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.960]   Because you cannot love God and money.
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.720]   Is that your master?
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.960]   Or is it sex?
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:41.160]   Or is it forgetting what God created sex to be?
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:46.000]   Have you become like an irrational animal?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.960]   Jesus has something more for you.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.720]   Or is it power?
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.640]   As they look at your life,
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.320]   as they look at how you go about work and friends,
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   or even church, there's constant power struggles in churches,
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.800]   which is the most pathetic one, I feel.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.640]   Or racing to be the most humble person.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:13.080]   Is power the master in your life?
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.840]   Is that the one that consumes you?
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.280]   Because I tell you, that thirst will never be satisfied
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.640]   just by you searching for more power,
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.120]   just for you to climb up the ladder more and more.
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.880]   You will not be satisfied.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.080]   Come before God.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.400]   Do not deny Him as master any longer.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.920]   And I wanna finish just with this.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.560]   The question is, okay, we get it.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.360]   Money, sex, and power, these are the things
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.320]   that I struggle with, these are the things
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.280]   that you struggle with.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.360]   But the question is, what can we do?
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:49.680]   How are we able to address these things,
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.280]   face these things, head on, talk about them?
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:54.760]   Well, I personally believe this is a start
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.720]   to even confess that these are the things
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.720]   that we face in this city, in this church, in our lives.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.280]   But then there are a few things that I want to finish with
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.960]   that I think will help us.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.760]   Number one is, oh, actually, they're all three questions
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.680]   so we can just put them all in one go.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.840]   The first question I'd like to ask you is,
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.640]   do you know His word?
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.880]   This starts with scripture, it has to.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.240]   It has to start with scripture.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.600]   Do you know God's word?
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.560]   And I'll tell you why it's so important.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.960]   It isn't just, you need to read the Bible
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.640]   because good Christians read the Bible
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.080]   so you just have to read it, no.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.720]   Because if you read God's word, if you read the Bible,
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.720]   I'll tell you what it'll do,
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.680]   it will show you the truth about you.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.040]   It will tell you who you are.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.920]   If you know God's word, it will tell you why you are here.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:47.800]   It will tell you that you needed to be rescued
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.280]   and it will tell you that you have been rescued.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.440]   And if you know the truth about who you actually are,
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.200]   then you will be secure in your own identity,
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.560]   then you won't have to fight for power.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.600]   Do you know His word?
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.160]   Do you know what scripture says?
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   Have you examined your mind?
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.520]   And do you know enough about what God says about you?
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.800]   Because if you do, you will know who you are
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:20.920]   and you will no longer need to fight
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.760]   and keep questing for power.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.000]   Second is, do you know His heart?
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.320]   So this is a step after you know His word
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.720]   because once you know His word,
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.360]   it's not enough just to keep it up here, right?
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.040]   It needs to drop into the heart.
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.320]   And I'm not talking about,
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.760]   are you able to memorise 100 Bible verses?
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.800]   This isn't what it is.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:46.280]   This is, do you know God's heart for you?
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.160]   Have you spent enough time with Him?
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.280]   That song there again,
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.360]   "Break my heart for what breaks yours,
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.880]   "everything I am for your kingdom's cause."
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.280]   If you spend enough time with God,
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.240]   you will start to know His heart.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:02.680]   If you spent enough time with me,
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.600]   you would know that I eat McDonald's at least once a week.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:12.000]   And then I eat roast duck at least once a week.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.440]   And so clearly meat is a thing that I like.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.000]   So you will know what James' heart is.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.160]   If you spent a week with Johnny,
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:26.160]   you will see that he's gonna grow up soon.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:32.200]   We're praying hard for that day.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:37.280]   Knowing him, it will be a day just before Jesus comes back.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:42.480]   But if you spend enough time with God,
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.480]   you will know His heart.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.400]   And this is even, this is from studying His word.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.080]   This is from reading His love letter to you.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:57.680]   You will discover His heart and you will know what love is.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.560]   Because if you know His word, you will know His heart
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.680]   because you will know that He is love.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.560]   And when you know that He is love,
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:09.880]   you will then in turn know that you are loved.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.880]   And when you know that you are loved,
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.520]   then you will know how to love
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.280]   because He's shown you how to love.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.360]   That there is no greater love than this
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:23.200]   when one would lay down their lives for another.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.520]   And you will see how Jesus loves you
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.160]   and you will finally get how to truly love
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.960]   by giving yourself up for someone else.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.520]   Then you will be able to have the correct,
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:38.200]   the high view of sexuality.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.200]   You will know truly what it means to love someone else.
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:49.240]   And finally, do you know His worth?
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.240]   Do you know scripture well enough?
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   Do you allow that to drop into your heart
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.000]   so you know that you are loved?
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.160]   And do you know what He did for you?
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.920]   Philippians 2, did you know that He was equal to God?
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:06.120]   He was God and He was the Word of the beginning?
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:10.720]   Yet He gave Himself up, He emptied Himself for you.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:15.720]   He deemed you worthy of His life.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.840]   And did you know that He is now the name
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.920]   exalted above every name?
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.680]   Did you know that He is the one,
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.280]   He's the only one who can completely satisfy you?
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.040]   Your wife can't do it, your husband can't do it,
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.160]   your boyfriend, your girlfriend,
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.960]   your professor, your boss, none of those people
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.200]   can satisfy you like He would.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.040]   Do you know that?
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.520]   Do you know His true worth?
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:43.240]   Because when you do, you will count everything else as loss
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.400]   when compared to knowing Him.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.680]   And when you do those things of this world,
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   money will not be the idol that holds onto you.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.800]   You will be willing to let it go, why?
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.240]   Because you know you have something so much more,
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.520]   so much bigger.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:05.240]   So know His Word and you'll be able to conquer power.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:08.080]   Know His heart and you'll be able to conquer sex.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.240]   Know His worth and you'll be able to conquer money.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:14.600]   Brothers and sisters, we need to talk about these things.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.120]   We are praying, we are singing,
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.800]   we are yearning for a revival,
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.280]   but it won't come unless we address these three things
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.200]   with clear and bold responses
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.920]   and that is the job of the church.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.360]   That is your duty, my duty.
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:33.480]   It is our responsibility to show the world a different way,
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.440]   to show the world a different way.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.800]   Money, sex, and power, these are the things
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:45.640]   that are the destructive heresies of that day and of today.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.600]   And I just wanted to finish with one of my favorite verses
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:52.880]   when it comes to examination and it's Psalm 139.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.800]   And I just wanted for all of us
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.880]   to be able to spend a few minutes now.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.920]   So as I invite the band to come up,
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.280]   I just want to read those verses to you
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.800]   and of course if you know them already,
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.960]   I invite you just to close your eyes.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.760]   I'd like to perform an examination
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.800]   of our hearts this evening.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:21.160]   You know, I've spoken a lot
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.200]   and you've probably forgotten most of it.
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:25.600]   (whimpering)
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.120]   But I want us to have a little bit of space now
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.880]   to allow us to open our hearts to God.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.640]   As the Psalmist says, "Search me, O garden, know my heart.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.960]   "Try me," or another version is, "Test me
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.080]   "and know my thoughts.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.720]   "And if there is any grievous or offensive way in me,
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.440]   "lead me on the way everlasting."
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.680]   Let's close our eyes.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.440]   (pages rustling)
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:42:01.280]   Let us just remain silent here just for a second
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.680]   without any noise or just...
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.760]   God, we just come before you.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:16.280]   We're confronted with that hard truth
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.920]   that we fall short once again.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.680]   (pages rustling)
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:30.840]   We lose our battle and we forget your worth.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   We forget your heart, we forget your word.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:39.920]   And Holy Spirit, I invite you just to be here right now
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.320]   just to speak to us about any destructive heresies
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.640]   that are in our own lives.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:49.320]   Any ways that we have denied you as our master.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.880]   'Cause we call you Lord, so you are our master
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   and we pray that that truth seeps into the way that we live.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:08.560]   So I come alongside my brothers and sisters.
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.560]   As your children, we repent of...
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:19.240]   Of anything offensive in us to do with any of us.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.600]   Any of those three things.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:28.120]   And show us the way everlasting.
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:32.000]   Show us how those things can glorify you.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Show us how those things can be good.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   Show us how even though the enemy uses them for evil,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.080]   Lord, that you can use them for good.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:50.160]   So we repent and we ask that you redeem and you restore.
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:58.760]   And as a body, we come before you now.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:03.200]   We just ask you to forever reign in our hearts.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.560]   And we realize the answer to those problems,
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.920]   to our problems, isn't actually to just look within,
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:14.520]   but it's to look up.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:18.600]   To look to you, to see that you are good
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.680]   and there is nothing good in us.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.640]   You are love, you are hope, you are light.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:31.640]   And we know we can conquer those things
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.480]   not by running away from them,
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.800]   but by running towards you.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:41.920]   You are the only thing that doesn't corrupt.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:45.320]   You are the only being that doesn't consume us
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.520]   to that level where it destroys us.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:53.360]   So you are good.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:45:00.040]   And we worship you.
[00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:06.320]   It's in your name we pray, amen.
