[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.760]   - Hello, hello, is that coming through?
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.440]   All right, very good.
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.440]   Okay, so when I was young, I loved board games, all right?
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.280]   But there was one game which I loved above all else.
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.080]   It was the game to rule all games.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.480]   And it is, of course, the one and only Monopoly.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.560]   (audience laughs)
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.880]   I hear the groans.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.960]   All right, so when extended family was around
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.520]   and everyone agreed to settle in
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.440]   and play Monopoly for a long haul,
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.880]   this was, to me, was like going to Disneyland.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:37.960]   I loved it.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.280]   I would terrorize my cousins who would have to hide from me
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.080]   and I would run around looking for them,
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.480]   saying, "Who wants to play the best game in the world?"
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.200]   And they would just hide in fear.
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.920]   Mel even got me this classic edition
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.600]   because I love it so much.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.280]   And here you can see us both just really enjoying a game,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.440]   both having such a great time.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.720]   Now, there was only one problem with Monopoly.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.160]   It wasn't my strategy and skills.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.520]   I was great with that.
[00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.000]   But it was the fact that after we had played,
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.240]   the money I had amassed was useless anywhere else, all right?
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.960]   I had a portfolio like you would never believe.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.640]   I had property, hotels, cash to the wazoo,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.080]   but it was useless anywhere else.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.320]   I couldn't even get a bag of lollies, all right?
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.520]   So it was like the shopkeeper didn't even know who I was.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.560]   The wealth I had amassed was useless.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.840]   And what did I actually do with that wealth while I had it?
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.800]   Well, according to various family and friends' accounts,
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.320]   I turned people against me.
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.080]   But when I was playing, nothing beyond that game mattered.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.160]   I could have used that game while I was playing
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.000]   so that when the game had finished,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I would be in more favour with those others around me.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.240]   It might have been a less exciting game,
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.320]   but afterwards I would have had better results
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.680]   and better standing amongst family and friends.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.880]   Now, in this parable, we see Jesus tell the story
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.680]   about this man, this unrighteous steward,
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.520]   who uses his position and his resources
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.040]   with his future in mind.
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.120]   Jesus uses this illustration to paint the picture
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   of how we as followers of him
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.320]   should be using worldly wealth and resources
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.000]   with the kingdom of God in mind and eternity in mind.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.480]   Now, this parable is quite a well-known one
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.240]   and also one that can leave us scratching our heads
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.240]   as to what it is like Jesus is actually telling us to do
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.960]   or what it is he is approving of and what he is commending.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.720]   On face value, we may come away with the impression
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.440]   that Jesus is okay with this master's dishonesty
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.800]   and even commending it.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.280]   Now, it is important for us to address this
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.560]   because it is not misunderstood
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.040]   as an endorsement for dodgy money practices,
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.480]   but we don't want to get too bogged down in this aspect.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.600]   So in verse one, we see that this man is accused
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.640]   of wasting his possessions.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.480]   Now, the Greek word used here is actually the same Greek
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.520]   that Luke uses in the parable of the prodigal son,
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.680]   which John preached last week.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.040]   Now, this word he uses to describe
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.520]   how the prodigal son uses his inheritance money,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.600]   meaning to squander or to waste.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   So we can say he wasn't just some manager
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.960]   who was bad at his work and needed more training,
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.960]   but he was abusing his position and wasting money away.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.640]   Now, in verses five to seven, we see the manager's plan
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.320]   that is supposed to help him have security
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.040]   in his soon unemployment.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.000]   So summoning his master's debtors one by one,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   he said to the first, "How much do you owe my master?"
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.640]   He said, "A hundred measures of oil."
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.040]   He said to him, "Take your bill and sit down quickly
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.160]   and write 50."
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.240]   Then he said to another, "And how much do you owe?"
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.800]   He said, "A hundred measures of wheat."
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.200]   He said to him, "Take your bill and write 80."
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.600]   Now, this also seems a little bit dodgy to his master, right?
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.200]   Now, while that may be a possibility,
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.680]   there are some other likely possibilities and explanations.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.080]   One which many commentaries put forth
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.320]   is that this money he was discounting
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.800]   was actually from his own commission, okay?
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.320]   A very generous commission, granted.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.400]   But, and that may seem crazy,
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.160]   but was given some of these margins,
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.000]   but is similar to how some tax collectors could operate
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.240]   in a very free, unregulated manner.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.600]   It may have also come from interests
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.680]   that would have been charged,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.320]   something that was illegal to do to fellow Israelites,
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.080]   according to Deuteronomy, but was practiced anyhow.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.560]   Or it could have been a combination of any of these things.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.840]   Okay, but what this can paint then
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.160]   is that rather than the steward
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.000]   who further cheats his master for selfish gain,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.600]   is actually sacrificing his own commission,
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.960]   what will be his last paycheck for the foreseeable future,
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.600]   at a time when he clearly needs it
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.160]   so that he can have a longer term provision and security.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.840]   It then begins to look a lot more like an investment.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.080]   Now, while it's important for us to address this,
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.840]   it's not what we wanna get bogged down with.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.800]   Jesus uses this to paint a larger picture
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.760]   and a larger point.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.560]   It is not the larger point in and of itself.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.360]   Now, these interpretations would just serve
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.280]   to make Jesus' point stronger.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.480]   Now, this illustration was also likely
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.000]   much more easily digested
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.160]   for those who were hearing it in real time.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.560]   Much like if someone now talks about buying a house,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.080]   we know that involves a mortgage, a deposit,
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.480]   taxes, lawyers, et cetera.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.160]   We aren't going to go into the details
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.360]   of all those little things
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.040]   every time we use buying a house as an analogy.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.360]   So then, what is the master commending in verse eight?
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.360]   Well, his shrewdness.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.360]   Now, we need to take a minute with this word shrewd.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.800]   It's a word that can give us a bit of a funny feeling.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.120]   Like it can mean like, we can think of it as cunning
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.600]   or maybe a bit too frugal and tight,
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.520]   the kind of person you don't really wanna go
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.160]   for a meal or drinks with,
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.080]   the kind who's nowhere to be seen when the Maidan comes.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.720]   So let's try and get rid of that feeling.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.040]   And what is the word?
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.560]   The original Greek, which we often see translated
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.840]   as shrewd, shrewdness, shrewdly,
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.160]   really has the meaning prudently,
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.800]   practically wise, acting with forethought.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.120]   And Jesus here is not commending any possible dishonesty
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.680]   in verses five to seven.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.280]   And he's certainly not commending the dishonesty
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.960]   in verse one, but he is commending his shrewdness.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.160]   He is commending his ability to act wisely
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.880]   in preparation for his future.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.880]   Likely at some cost of sacrifice,
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.720]   he is commending that his plans was well thought out
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.920]   and meant to bring about a desired result.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.040]   The master is commending his shrewdness.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.600]   Now we need to understand that the lesson then
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.080]   is not to make money in whatever way you can,
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.680]   so then you can use it for the kingdom of God.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.960]   This is where we can easily get trapped
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.520]   in the pursuit of money,
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.960]   convincing ourselves it's for a noble cause.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.720]   I hate to tell you this,
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.400]   God doesn't need your money actually as much as you think.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.920]   Don't get too much relief in that by the way,
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.480]   but he is much more interested in our hearts.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.040]   Our money can be a reflection of that,
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.880]   but it is often also a guide for our hearts.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.920]   In Mark 12, there is a story of a widow
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.200]   who throws in two small copper coins
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.360]   while others are throwing in large amounts.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.000]   And Jesus looks at the widow and commends her,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.520]   for while these other people were giving
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.760]   from a place of wealth, she was giving all that she had.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.440]   Now, if it was just a matter of increasing
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.280]   the dollar amounts that we give,
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.800]   Jesus would be commending those who gave plenty
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.600]   and ignoring her.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.520]   But he recognises that she is putting God above her money
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.320]   in such a significant way.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.920]   So why use this character
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.960]   of the dishonest steward in the parable?
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.600]   Now, Jesus uses this shady character
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.720]   to help make clearer the comparison
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.000]   and the rebuke that we see in verse eight.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.760]   "For people in this world are more shrewd
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.600]   in dealing with their own kind
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.040]   than are people of the light."
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.040]   So even this squanderer can get his head together
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.760]   and be shrewd in his planning for what is coming
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.560]   and for his future.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.680]   Yet us Christians often aren't wise
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.000]   in planning for our future, which is one of eternity.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.040]   Even this unrighteous man is wise enough
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.200]   to use his resources to get people on his side.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.000]   Yet followers of God can't show the same wisdom
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.080]   in using their money for kingdom purposes.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.840]   Jesus uses this broken man
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.200]   to show us Christians in this rebuke,
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.800]   if he can get it, why can't you?
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.360]   So verse eight is also really where we get
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.720]   to the key of what Jesus is saying.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.880]   Someone who doesn't believe in eternity
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.760]   for what will plan for what they value most.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.880]   You know, that might be a nice house, car,
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.720]   good family, travel, experiences, whatever that may be.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.160]   They'll make sacrifices, learn skills,
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.280]   invest time, money and energy
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.080]   so that they can attain and enjoy these things
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.120]   that they value.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.600]   They'll research the best loan plans.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.880]   What are the best holiday destination?
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.680]   What's the cheapest way I could do this?
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:15.400]   Now we do this also, but then to us Christians furthermore,
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.920]   what do we, or what are we supposed to value the most?
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.440]   That is God and his kingdom.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.400]   We wanna see the kingdom of God here as it is in heaven.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.440]   And we also wanna spend our eternity in heaven with God.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.320]   We know that our lives go beyond this world.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.360]   And we know that our actions aren't just meant
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   to get us nice things, but can have eternal consequences.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.720]   So we can take lessons from those who live in such a way
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.760]   for their earthly goals.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.320]   And if they can do that, surely we can live in such a way
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.440]   for the kingdom of God, which is so much greater
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.520]   than anything they may be living for
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.000]   or anything we may have here.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.720]   Now, so how much does our use of money
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.680]   and our resources reflect this?
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.400]   How much does our planning and forethought
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.960]   reflect our value in the kingdom?
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.440]   Do we sit down intentionally and think about this?
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.680]   Okay, I'm currently making this much money I've worked out,
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.800]   I can put this much towards helping the poor.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.000]   Does our planning and wisdom into how we treat
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.920]   our resources in a God honoring way,
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.560]   match that of our planning and with planning
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.120]   that goes for a holiday.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:38.040]   And let's review who Jesus is talking to in this parable.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.760]   Let's look at verse one again.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.320]   "Jesus told his disciples."
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.880]   This setup is key.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.640]   Who Jesus is talking to in this parable is key.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.920]   And many other parables are directed towards Pharisees,
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.960]   those trying to trick Jesus
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.120]   or those who wanna learn how to become followers.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.640]   But not that many are directed to the disciples.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.560]   We see later in verse 14,
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.680]   that Pharisees were in the vicinity and heard this parable,
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.360]   but this is specifically directed to the disciples,
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.920]   to those who had signed up and said,
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.520]   "I wanna be a follower of Jesus."
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.520]   So if you're a Christian,
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.760]   while all the parables relate to you
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.880]   and are for you,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.920]   this parable that Jesus speaks is directly to you.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.400]   Consider how important of a lesson this is
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.160]   that Jesus is telling.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.600]   Now, these disciples that he's speaking this to,
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.560]   are the ones who will start his church
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:44.560]   and advance his message after his death and resurrection.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.200]   And Jesus talks about our worldly wealth
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.000]   and wisdom in using it.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.280]   He is saying this to the followers of the church
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.160]   that we are a part of today
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.120]   and that we are continuing on today.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.560]   So I just wanna make sure we get the significance of that,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.160]   how important it is,
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.680]   because how we use our worldly wealth and resources
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.440]   is not secondary,
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.800]   but actually foundational to our following of Jesus.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.280]   It's not secondary,
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.360]   but foundational in our following of Jesus.
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.520]   So we don't have a choice in ignoring this.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.960]   So then what about these disciples?
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.040]   Did they take this on board?
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.840]   Well, let's evaluate.
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.080]   In Acts 2, in describing the fellowship of the disciples,
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.240]   we read this and let's read this out together.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.960]   I'll take this in, one, two, three.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.080]   They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.440]   and to fellowship,
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.200]   to the breaking of bread and to prayer.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.360]   Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.120]   and signs performed by the apostles.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.080]   All the believers were together
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.840]   and had everything in common.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.200]   They sold property and possessions
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.800]   to give to anyone who had need.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.320]   Every day, they continued to meet together
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.320]   in the temple courts.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.320]   They broke bread in their homes
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.680]   and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:11.640]   praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.320]   And the Lord added to their number daily
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.960]   those who were being saved.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.360]   An amazing picture of church.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.920]   And let's look at verse 45.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.280]   They sold property and possessions
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.640]   to give to anyone who had need.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.600]   Now, this was an integral part of who they were
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.880]   and their ministry.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.480]   In Acts 6, later on,
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.800]   we see they had a daily distribution of food
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.520]   and the men who oversaw that
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.120]   were to be full of the spirit and wisdom.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.560]   They were good stewards of what they had
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.920]   and there was an intentionality to what they were doing.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.880]   It wasn't an afterthought or mere obligation,
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.920]   but an integral part of who they were.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.840]   And in their faithfulness in this,
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.640]   as well as in the other areas,
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:01.520]   we see that they had the favour of all the people
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.560]   and the Lord was adding to their number daily.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.800]   We see a very real example of what Jesus says
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:09.840]   in Luke 16, 9,
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.720]   in using worldly wealth to gain friends.
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.800]   And note how it is that they use their wealth.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.120]   Now, this passage is often applied to all sorts of resources
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.560]   such as our time and skills, et cetera.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.040]   Now, while these are applicable,
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.400]   it is important to recognise that
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:26.920]   at the heart of this passage,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.560]   it is talking about our money,
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.840]   which includes our possessions.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.080]   Because as we look at the verses following,
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.960]   Jesus keeps bringing it back to this.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.800]   In verse 9,
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.920]   use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourself.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.000]   11, if you have not been trustworthy
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.560]   in handling worldly wealth,
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.640]   who will trust you with true riches.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.800]   Similarly in 12, with property and property of your own.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.880]   And it cannot be as clear as in verse 13,
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.680]   the big knockout punch,
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.800]   you cannot serve both God and money.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.960]   Now, verse 11 says,
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.400]   if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth,
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.040]   who will trust you with true riches.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.280]   If God sees we are poor in handling worldly wealth,
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.400]   why would he entrust us with kingdom matters,
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.600]   which are of so much greater value?
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.400]   Similarly, if the world sees our handling of worldly wealth,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.880]   and it is just corrupt and selfish,
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.800]   why would they care what we have to say
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.480]   about Jesus and eternity?
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:32.000]   And think about what a shame that is.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.040]   Because if I'm selfish with my money,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.960]   does that change that Jesus is good
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.080]   and that he has saved us?
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.280]   No.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.600]   But it does make me a poor representative of that.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.200]   And why would anyone trust me
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.520]   with what I may say about salvation and eternal life,
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.640]   when I handle worldly wealth so poorly,
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.760]   and in a manner that doesn't point to a life beyond this one?
[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:58.320]   Now, I wanna make a distinction here.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.600]   Often when we hear handling wealth poorly,
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.800]   we think of things such as not having
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.080]   adequate retirement plans and things of that nature.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.760]   Now, having that is good
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.880]   and something we should employ wisdom in.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.880]   But when it is talking about handling worldly wealth
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.080]   in this context,
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.040]   is much more to do with our generosity,
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:23.040]   our use of money as though there is a life beyond this one.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.120]   When people criticize Christians
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.520]   for being hypocritical in this area,
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.440]   it's not a critique of our poor performing MPFs
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.480]   or stock portfolios.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.080]   It's about greed, hoarding, not caring about the poor.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:42.320]   So is there a some way we can get out of doing this right?
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.320]   Now, this topic is really unavoidable in the Bible.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.280]   The fact that we have to walk with integrity in this area
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.200]   is not really up for debate.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.120]   What about if I just am better in other areas to compensate?
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.320]   You know, I'll serve more, I'll be kinder, all those things.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.560]   Well, yes, do those things.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.360]   But no, we can't get out of these.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.760]   Jesus warns us in verse 13
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.400]   that we cannot serve both God and money.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.800]   We simply can't have it both ways.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.720]   Even if we could attain perfection
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.000]   in every other aspect of life, it still wouldn't work.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.760]   And if we did think that we found a loophole,
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.880]   actually we are the ones that would lose out from that.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.280]   1 Timothy 6 verse 10 says,
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.440]   "For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.800]   Some people eager for money have wandered from the faith
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.920]   and pierced themselves with many griefs."
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.880]   Now look at the focus.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.960]   We don't just avoid a love of money
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.200]   because it's harmful to other people, which it is,
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.640]   but it's harmful to you.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.240]   But you will pierce yourself with many griefs.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.280]   And this verse shows it can be a real trap
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.000]   in which people also lose their faith.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.080]   It's for our benefit more than anyone else's
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.880]   that we understand this.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.400]   And we see this in the parable, the way Jesus lays it out.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.920]   This parable is not only directed to us, but it is for us.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.080]   It's for our benefit.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.840]   We need this more than God does.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.480]   We need to let go of our love of money
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.560]   much more than God needs our money to continue His ministry.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:25.360]   And the benefit is twofold.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.760]   Not only are we saved from grief caused by our love of money,
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.400]   but also in how we receive from our generosity.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.920]   Now this message isn't even emphasising give money
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.240]   and then we can be able to be a blessing to others.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.560]   In this parable here,
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.840]   the tenants of the field were blessed for sure
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.360]   by the discount, but the steward was really bringing
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.400]   about his own longer term provision.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.200]   And we also will be welcomed
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.480]   into eternal dwelling along with others.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.160]   In 2 Corinthians, it says, remember this,
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.760]   "Whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.640]   and whoever sows generously will also reap generously.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.440]   Each of you should give what you have decided
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.520]   in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.080]   for God loves a cheerful giver."
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:15.720]   The biggest beneficiary of any generosity
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.040]   that you may have is not the person
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.200]   you are generous towards.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.240]   It's not God as though you were doing Him some big favour.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.960]   It's you.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.840]   You're the biggest beneficiary of your generosity.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.960]   It's the best investment any of us can possibly make.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.200]   Let's look at what Jesus says in verse nine.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.520]   And I tell you, "Make friends for yourself
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:44.680]   by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails,
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.200]   they may receive you into eternal dwellings."
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.800]   A great note here as well is,
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.160]   how did the steward's plan work out by the way?
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.720]   Actually, we don't know.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.040]   We don't know how the steward's plan worked out
[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.960]   if those tenants helped him.
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.080]   There's no guarantee that his investment
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:03.600]   in those tenants paid off.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.360]   There's no guarantee with our earthly investments.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.600]   But the difference for us is that we know
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.800]   that Jesus can guarantee us that what we give Him
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.200]   and how we live for Him will seem like nothing
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.160]   when we are with Him in heaven.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.360]   And so what is this unrighteous
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.920]   or in some versions, worldly wealth?
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.720]   The word describing the wealth
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.280]   is the same to use to describe the steward.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.000]   Now, this is not an endorsement to attain money
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.080]   in whichever which way you can.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:35.480]   But this wealth just belongs to the world.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.680]   It has no righteousness to it.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   It doesn't come with us into heaven
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.800]   and it has a great potential to corrupt and destroy us.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.720]   And as verse nine points out, it will fail.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.680]   One way or another, even on earth, we can lose it.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.080]   The steward's plan, while shrewd,
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.160]   doesn't guarantee his security.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.640]   But even if all goes well here,
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.280]   our money fails in granting us eternal life.
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.040]   There's no amount of money we can attain
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.560]   that will get us eternal life.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.600]   So we should use it while we are here
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.160]   and have it to help advance God's kingdom.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.200]   And the money we are so proud to have here
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.480]   is as silly as monopoly money, where we are going.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.920]   It's like if I had taken all my monopoly winnings
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.400]   to an interview for bank manager at HSBC,
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.640]   bragging about how I owned all the green
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.160]   and the dark blue and how I had hotels.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.360]   And this was my credential as to why I'm so significant
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.920]   and will be such a great bank manager.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.840]   It's laughably silly.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.160]   And while that money is extremely relevant
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.240]   while playing the game, it's irrelevant thereafter.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.760]   Now, what we have in this life is monopoly money.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.640]   We are best to use it to advance the kingdom of God
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.560]   that we may be welcomed into eternal dwellings.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.040]   All right, so how do we do this?
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.480]   I want to give some practical ways to do this.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.040]   And as we go through, this isn't a message of guilt.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   I don't want you to just go away with just,
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.360]   "Paul told me I need to give more money."
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.880]   Now, that may be true.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.760]   That may be true.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.320]   But what is more important is we shift our understanding
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   of money into its rightful place.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.600]   A worldly thing, a potential tool,
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.240]   which also has tremendous ability to corrupt us,
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.160]   but that we can use also in advancing God's kingdom.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:36.040]   And that we want to treat with wisdom and intentionality
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.880]   that we ourselves and others may benefit.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.440]   So the first point is tithing.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.040]   Now, I'm referring to giving of 10% to the Lord.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.680]   Now, this, as Christians, to be honest,
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.280]   is not really generosity.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.320]   This is a baseline of giving.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.600]   All right, we see some verses such as in Leviticus,
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.480]   "A tithe of everything from the land,
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.360]   "where the grain from the soil or fruit from the tree
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.880]   "belongs to the Lord.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.920]   "It is holy to the Lord."
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.720]   And in Deuteronomy, we see,
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.160]   "Be sure to set aside a tenth of all
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.800]   "that your fields produce each year."
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.000]   Now, while there is some conversation
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.760]   to be had around a mandate in this sense in the New Testament,
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.160]   the standard of generosity in the New Testament
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.760]   is actually much higher, requiring all of ourselves.
[00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.240]   So actually, tithing is a really great place to start
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.200]   if you haven't already.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.080]   And there is nothing better than this
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.360]   for building in the habit of giving
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.160]   and the reminder to ourselves
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.520]   that all of our money and things actually belongs to God.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.240]   It comes from the Lord and it belongs to Him.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.680]   So then putting that back to the kingdom of God.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.200]   And we often think to ourselves,
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.280]   "If we win the lottery
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.720]   "or if I just become super rich very quickly,
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:50.800]   "then I'll become super generous."
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.760]   But this typically isn't true.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.880]   And Jesus even says this in verse 10,
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.960]   "Whoever can be trusted with very little
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.040]   "can also be trusted with much.
[00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.960]   "And whoever is dishonest with very little
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.200]   "also will be dishonest with much."
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.520]   So we need to build in giving as a habit.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.080]   Now, following on from that, we get to being generous.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.600]   There are countless verses on being generous.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.040]   This is actually the world's easiest fact check.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.160]   Just Google Bible verses about being generous
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.880]   and then just spend the whole night reading through.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.120]   So be generous with your family and friends
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.760]   and with those spreading the gospel.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.680]   One example being in Philippians 4,
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:35.080]   Paul commends the Philippians for helping him with his needs.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.440]   And then of course, being generous with the poor.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.080]   Many of these countless verses
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.000]   specifically mentioned helping the poor
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.320]   and also caring about them.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.040]   Some examples, Proverbs 14, 31,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.560]   "Whoever oppresses a poor man insults his maker,
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.040]   "but he who is generous to the needy honors him.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.360]   "Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.480]   "and he will repay him for his deed."
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.320]   In Deuteronomy,
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.240]   "For there will never cease to be poor in the land.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.480]   "Therefore I command you,
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.400]   "you shall open wide your hands to your brother
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.000]   "to the needy and to the poor in your land."
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.920]   And in Matthew,
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.000]   "And the king will answer them,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.560]   "Truly I say to you, as you did to the least of these brothers,
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.640]   "you did it to me."
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.480]   And on and on and on.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.040]   Now imagine the favour
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.120]   that people would have towards the church
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.280]   if we live this out.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.680]   And many of these verses still show
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.920]   that you will reap the reward for your generosity.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.880]   We do actually need this reminder,
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.880]   not because we want to cultivate selfishness in our giving,
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.920]   but actually we recognize that we are weak and selfish
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.360]   and that we need this reminder
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.640]   that this is actually good for me.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:48.400]   So it's good to remember that this is for our benefit.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.360]   But the other reason we need this reminder
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:53.320]   is to keep our pride out of it.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.640]   Keep our pride of saying,
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.640]   "Oh, I'm such a generous person."
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.080]   Or to even to use how generous we may be
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.800]   to put ourselves above others.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.680]   Our goal is not to be like the Pharisee who prays,
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:08.120]   "Thank you God that I'm such a good person
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.040]   "and not like that tax collector.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.080]   "I fast and I tithe."
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.880]   And also consider Matthew 6, 1,
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.080]   "Be careful not to practice your righteousness
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.440]   "in front of others to be seen by them.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.920]   "If you do, you will have no reward
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.480]   "from your Father in heaven."
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.840]   Our generosity is not to become just another status symbol
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.280]   that we chase and idolize.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.480]   And so we want to be intentional in this.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.040]   Give freely, but with purpose.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.840]   Look at what is effective in helping those in need.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.560]   Organizations that are doing this well.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.080]   We want to approach this with excellence
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.000]   and not just as a tick the box.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.200]   We need to actually care.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.120]   And lastly, I want to lay down this challenge.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.760]   Plan for this.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.440]   We want to grow in our wisdom
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.440]   and our intentionality in this.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.000]   The steward had a plan.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.800]   He thought about it and then he carried it out.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.040]   Now we are actually coming up to the perfect time
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.480]   to do this practically.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.360]   April 1st, exactly two weeks away
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.000]   is of course the start of the next financial year.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.400]   So let's make a goal.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.200]   So let's make a goal sometime in the course
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.880]   of the next two weeks to sit down and think about
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.400]   and go through what our lives look like financially
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.120]   in relation to the kingdom of God.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.600]   Treat it like an audit.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.200]   Treat it as though you were researching to buy a house
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.600]   or go on a dream holiday.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.400]   Get into the nitty gritty of it.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.280]   Ask, am I being a good steward?
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.200]   Using my money shrewdly in ways
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.800]   that can advance the kingdom
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.400]   and am I investing in my eternal dwelling?
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.080]   We can remember this as thinking of April 1st,
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.720]   not as April Fool's Day,
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.560]   but April Wisdom Day.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:53.400]   - Yeah, that sounds good.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.640]   - So yeah.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.480]   So,
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.200]   though we can remember it,
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.280]   we can remember it.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.040]   And hopefully that one will stick with you for years.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.080]   So,
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.400]   decide on a timeframe to keep coming back
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.640]   and revisiting this question.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.080]   This may be monthly, quarterly,
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.560]   or at the very least, make this annual.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.000]   And make it memorable,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.880]   such as the first Tuesday of each month or April 1st,
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.400]   which is also known to some as April Wisdom Day.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.760]   (congregation laughing)
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.680]   If you're a family, do this together.
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.720]   And God loves when we can give joyfully.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.760]   2 Corinthians says,
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:36.720]   "Each of you should give
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.240]   what you've decided in your heart to give,
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.320]   not reluctantly or under compulsion,
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.600]   for God loves a cheerful giver."
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.800]   So pray through this,
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.520]   asking for wisdom and help and guidance in this area,
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   because it's imperative that we get this right.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.640]   As we wrap up, and as the band comes back up,
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.440]   we need to remember God actually is much more concerned
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.880]   with our heart than our money.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.600]   He wants us to have a heart toward the kingdom and eternity.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   And He knows that this is such a strong area for us
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.160]   where we can harden our hearts and struggle.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.600]   But this is also such an effective way
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.880]   of pointing our hearts toward Him
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.520]   and surrendering to Him
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.200]   and for also for others to then see Him.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.120]   So remember the root of why we are doing this
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.920]   to begin with, and what, or more accurately,
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.520]   who gives us that ability?
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.360]   It is for the one that though He was rich,
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.600]   for our sakes became poor,
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.520]   that we may become rich.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.840]   He is our strength in this, and He is our reason.
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.920]   And it is by His grace that we are saved.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.440]   We don't come from this as we are such generous people,
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.760]   but we follow Jesus' example,
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.800]   considering what He gave for us
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.000]   and how much greater it is what He gave for us
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.200]   than what is required of us.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.000]   Since what we have is not really ours anyway,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.760]   we're mere stewards.
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.280]   So let's be wise, thoughtful, and generous
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.240]   with how we treat our worldly wealth,
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.480]   not for our own glory, but for His.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.320]   Let us pray.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.960]   Thank you, Lord, for all You've done for us,
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.520]   all You've blessed us with,
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:20.560]   and all You continue to do for us, Lord.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.720]   We pray, ask You now that You would protect us
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.200]   from the love of money and from our pride.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.040]   Ask that You help us in being generous with each other
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.680]   and with those in need,
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.520]   and be generous with what You have given us.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.480]   And we ask, Lord, for Your wisdom in how to deal
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.280]   with the wealth that we have in this world,
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.880]   and that You would help us to honour You
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.240]   with what we have.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.680]   Pray this in Your name, amen.
