1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - Thank you.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:14,820
 Thank you so much, Pastor John, for having me here, Pastor Michelle, especially on mission

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,600
 weekend.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,560
 And as we think about mission, and I think that's what the focus is for you this weekend,

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:31,480
 I think it's important to recognize that as people of faith, as members of the body of

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:41,400
 Christ, as members of God's family, we have a very specific mission.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:51,360
 We have a very specific calling, not just to our own families, but we have a mission

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,920
 and a calling to those who don't have families in the community around us.

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:05,760
 So you can see behind me, this is a picture of my family, and you're not seeing double.

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,080
 I do have six little boys.

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,680
 So you can see that family is really important to me.

12
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,240
 I really do love children.

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,600
 And I wanna tell you this, and this is a professionally taken photograph, but I'm gonna talk about

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,760
 family, and not because I have a perfect family, or I've had a perfect experience growing up

15
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,440
 here in Hong Kong.

16
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,160
 In fact, my family is like any other family, probably like your families.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:51,280
 We've experienced tragedy, and hardship, and pain, but the reality is, I've been able to

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:59,640
 walk through all of those things in my life, because I know what it's like to grow up in

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,400
 a loving family.

20
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,800
 And not just with my own family, my six younger brothers and sisters, and my parents, but

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,520
 I was raised in the church here in Hong Kong.

22
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:20,640
 And I really experienced what it means to have spiritual mothers and fathers, spiritual

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,640
 aunts and uncles, brothers and sisters, and cousins.

24
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,240
 In fact, there's quite a few of them in the room here today, which I didn't expect, but

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,240
 they continue to support me.

26
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:39,160
 I probably met Pastor John when I was 11 or 12.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,880
 I was so thrilled, actually, to see the Titus High School program, because he knew me when

28
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:52,400
 I was a not very obedient member of our own church high school program.

29
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,660
 But the church family helped to raise me, and continue to invest in me as I raise my

30
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,240
 own children.

31
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:08,760
 And the amazing thing is that the God that we serve, the God that we serve is a really

32
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,480
 good Father.

33
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,420
 And He is the author and the designer of family.

34
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,480
 And so family is really important to Him, too.

35
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:29,720
 In fact, the Bible tells us that God is the Father to the fatherless, He's the defender

36
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:37,200
 of widows, and He sets the lonely, even the lonely who are here in this room today, He

37
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,000
 sets the lonely in family.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,480
 And I believe that part of our mission and our calling as the church is to be family

39
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,800
 for those who are lonely.

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:56,920
 And I believe that when we rise up and answer that calling, when we respond to what God

41
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,120
 is telling us to do, we are going to see brokenness restored.

42
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,160
 We are going to see the lives of children and families right here in the city of Hong

43
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,960
 Kong changed.

44
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,440
 I believe that we'll see the culture of Hong Kong transformed.

45
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:23,360
 And in doing so, I believe that we ourselves will be transformed in the process.

46
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,280
 I know those are all good words, right?

47
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,220
 And we've probably all read this scripture, but how real is it to us, actually?

48
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,800
 So rather than expounding on the Bible more, I want to tell you a story of a young friend

49
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
 of mine.

50
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,920
 She's living with us right now.

51
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,960
 And I got to have coffee with her earlier this week, a couple of days ago, and I asked

52
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,120
 her if it would be okay with her if I shared her story with you.

53
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
 And I've changed her name.

54
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:06,200
 This isn't her name, but I'm sharing all of this with you with her permission.

55
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:13,600
 I'm going to call her Summer, and I want to tell you Summer's life story.

56
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:22,160
 Summer was born to a teenage mom who didn't have any community support.

57
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,360
 Her mom was really struggling with drugs, which many troubled young people who do not

58
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,480
 have family support do.

59
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:41,400
 And when she fell pregnant and delivered Summer, her baby was put immediately into the residential

60
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,440
 care system.

61
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,220
 Her mother actually then went on to have seven more children.

62
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,060
 Her mom, by the way, is younger than I am.

63
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,960
 Her mom went on to have seven more children, so she has a total of eight children now,

64
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,120
 all with different fathers.

65
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,120
 Every single one of them was put into the residential care system here in Hong Kong

66
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,320
 immediately from birth.

67
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:15,640
 Now a couple of Summer's siblings had a social worker who really fought for them and who

68
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,320
 understood the concept of adoption, which most people in Hong Kong don't.

69
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,560
 So a couple of her siblings actually were able to be adopted, but most of them have

70
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,680
 spent their entire childhoods and are still there in orphanages and foster families across

71
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,200
 the city of Hong Kong.

72
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,400
 Summer actually started out in a foster home and her next sister was placed there with

73
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
 her.

74
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,960
 But after it was discovered that the foster parents were terribly abusing them, they were

75
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,240
 removed from their foster family and they were put in a large orphanage here on Hong

76
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,760
 Kong side.

77
00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:01,800
 Now Summer stayed in that orphanage until she was 15, when as her behavior was more

78
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,800
 challenging because she never got to go home and visit family.

79
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,720
 She never had anybody there for her.

80
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,960
 Eventually at 15, they took her out of that orphanage and they placed her into a boarding

81
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
 school.

82
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,800
 But what that really means is like a girl's prison.

83
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:28,640
 She was diagnosed from an early age with ADHD and with ODD, which is oppositional defiant

84
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,440
 disorder.

85
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,080
 And she really struggled.

86
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:42,120
 She had been moved around and she struggled, especially actually with controlling her anger.

87
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,520
 She told me that the few times that her mom did come to visit her, which would maybe be

88
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,280
 once a year, even in primary school, her mom would try to steal her food and her pocket

89
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,960
 money.

90
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:05,600
 So Summer really didn't have anybody and it was, you know, she really struggled.

91
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,080
 But despite all of the challenges, actually Summer's a really pretty young girl.

92
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,920
 She's really smart and actually very athletic.

93
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,760
 Through the orphanage that she'd been raised in, she'd had the opportunity to do rugby

94
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,920
 training at the football club.

95
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,640
 So she was actually a great rugby player and ended up playing for one of the Hong Kong

96
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,720
 rugby teams.

97
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:31,880
 But when she was 17 years old, she fell pregnant.

98
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,600
 She was suspended from school.

99
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 She couldn't stay in her boarding school anymore.

100
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:47,000
 And eventually she had to drop out because she needed to take care of her young daughter,

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,920
 especially because right around the time of her daughter's birth, her boyfriend, the father,

102
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,600
 was sentenced to a very long prison sentence, where he still is today.

103
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,920
 So here's Summer, 17 years old.

104
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,480
 She's never had parents.

105
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,240
 She's never had a family.

106
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,960
 And now she has a little girl.

107
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,320
 Well, she struggled alone for the last couple of years.

108
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:22,080
 And then this last year, earlier this year, she's 19 years old, she fell pregnant again.

109
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:30,800
 Now thankfully, even though Summer was so vulnerable and lonely, she'd had a positive

110
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,240
 interaction with Mother's Choice before.

111
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,920
 And so she reached out to call us and she asked if she could be admitted into our refuge,

112
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,560
 into our hostel, because she literally had no other place to go.

113
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:54,920
 And, you know, it's been amazing to me to see Summer start to thrive, learn how to trust

114
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
 another adult.

115
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,400
 And I've got to tell you, she's 19 now, but she's still very much a little girl.

116
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,120
 And it's like having a 12 or 13-year-old staying with you.

117
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,560
 She's learning how to trust.

118
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,920
 She's starting to relax.

119
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,120
 She's really loved being with the house mothers and in a family-like environment.

120
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,840
 And it's been easier for her to control her anger.

121
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:25,360
 But a couple of months ago when her baby was born, she realized there was just no way that

122
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,680
 she could take care of her baby.

123
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,200
 She knew she wanted to give birth to the baby, but she just realized, "I don't even know

124
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,480
 how I'm going to take care of myself and my two-year-old."

125
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:44,080
 And so she made what I think is just an incredibly courageous decision to place her baby for

126
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
 adoption.

127
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,320
 Now, Summer is actually still living with us.

128
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:58,160
 And that's because there is not one single other human being in Hong Kong, not one friend,

129
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:05,040
 not one family member, not one acquaintance who can help her.

130
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,720
 So we've been doing our best.

131
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,520
 Basic things, we helped her learn how to apply for a job.

132
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,600
 She's got a part-time job, but she actually didn't know how to open a bank account.

133
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,520
 So we had to help her open a bank account, teaching her really basic life skills like

134
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,000
 how to cook and how to take care of herself and how to get around.

135
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,480
 And things are looking up for her.

136
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,680
 She's going to have a really hard road ahead, taking care of herself, a young girl, and

137
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,800
 her two-year-old.

138
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,160
 But she's working hard, and she's saving.

139
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,520
 She's hoping that she can get a safe place for her and her daughter.

140
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:53,800
 And she's starting to heal from some of the truly horrific childhood trauma that she's

141
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,400
 been through.

142
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:03,920
 And she still faces a lot of fear and uncertainty about her future.

143
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:12,600
 And I'm telling you Summer's story today, even though Summer's journey isn't over, because

144
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,680
 Summer's story is not unique.

145
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:25,600
 Although Hong Kong is one of the most beautiful, modern, and affluent cities in the world,

146
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,000
 I mean, so when I drove in today to come here for the service, I looked across the harbor

147
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,920
 and I just thought, "Wow, we live in a beautiful, beautiful city."

148
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,000
 But the reality is one in five children in Hong Kong lives in poverty.

149
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,880
 That means they go to bed without having had three meals in the day.

150
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:56,040
 There are tens of thousands of children in Hong Kong who have been exposed to child abuse,

151
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,180
 child neglect, and abandonment.

152
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,920
 Many of them are living in risky and dangerous living situations.

153
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,320
 And oftentimes it's because their parents, they're not necessarily bad people, but they're

154
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,160
 people who are really isolated.

155
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,840
 They don't have extended family support.

156
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,520
 They don't have community support, and they're really struggling.

157
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,120
 And so their children are at risk.

158
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,880
 And the most vulnerable of those tens of thousands of children across Hong Kong are those children

159
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,720
 who are like Summer, okay?

160
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,760
 Those who are not living with their family.

161
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,840
 They don't have a safe, loving, permanent family, and their parents are in prison, or

162
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,640
 their parents are on drugs, or their parents are struggling with some kind of relational

163
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,400
 or family or job crisis.

164
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,240
 And so those parents place children like Summer into the residential care system in Hong Kong,

165
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,160
 or their children are removed from them.

166
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,560
 And these children are living actually all across the city, even near where you live.

167
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,040
 And they're in foster families, they're in orphanages, they're in small group homes,

168
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,960
 they're in boys' and girls' homes like the one that Summer was in.

169
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:20,000
 And I believe that it's those institutionalized children who've been in institutionalized

170
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,240
 care that we are called to because they are the most vulnerable in the city.

171
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
 So how many of those children are there?

172
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:37,640
 Well, there are about 4,000 children living in full-time institutionalized care in Hong

173
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,280
 Kong, from newborn to 18 years old.

174
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,640
 And that's not because there's only 4,000 children that need care, that's because that's

175
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,480
 the only number of beds that are available.

176
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,920
 On any given day across the city, on any day, okay, there's at least 400 children on the

177
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,560
 wait list waiting to get in.

178
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,400
 Those children will wait for months, either in hospitals taking up hospital beds, or staying

179
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,720
 in a dangerous or abusive situation, and many of them actually never get off the wait list

180
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,360
 and they stay in an uncertain situation.

181
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,960
 And I think most alarming for me is that for those who do get a placement in residential

182
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:27,220
 care in Hong Kong, it's very likely that they'll spend years and years in the system.

183
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:36,320
 So although 90% of those 4,000 children that are in care have a plan for family reunion,

184
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,800
 meaning the plan is not for them to be adopted, the plan is for them to go back to their birth

185
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,200
 families, their mom and their dad.

186
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:49,680
 The sad reality is that almost half of those cases will never be reunited with their families,

187
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,080
 and they will stay in care until they're 18.

188
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,040
 The other half usually spend years before they go back to their parents.

189
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:04,240
 I think part of it is that our system and our community don't support vulnerable and

190
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,760
 struggling families to be able to bring their children back home.

191
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,240
 And yet on the flip side, we have all these kids waiting, but in our culture we don't

192
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,280
 really understand or believe in adoption.

193
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:23,920
 And that's because I think across Hong Kong, most of us, we define family only by blood.

194
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,360
 And there's a belief, and I need to confront us and the church, because I think there's

195
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,420
 a belief that's also held by many people in the church in Hong Kong, that because children

196
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:41,560
 are growing up in an institution, because they have a roof over their head, they have

197
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:48,480
 three meals to eat, they have a subsidy to go to school, they're doing okay.

198
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,760
 They're better off than many children, right?

199
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:58,160
 So because of that belief, that resistance to adoption, lack of support for birth families,

200
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,560
 and thinking children, they're safe because they've got a roof over their head, kids stay

201
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,360
 stuck in institutionalized care.

202
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,640
 And I need to tell you why that's concerning.

203
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,080
 Because there is no institution.

204
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,640
 There is no orphanage.

205
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
 There is no small group home.

206
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,240
 There's no foster family even, who can match the love or the care and the attention that

207
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:27,120
 a permanent, safe, loving family can offer.

208
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,040
 And there's a spiritual reason for that too.

209
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,760
 It's because God is a relational God.

210
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:40,000
 He intended for children, every child, to be raised in a family.

211
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,160
 And he intended every single family to be supported by the community.

212
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,120
 There is no family who can do it by themselves.

213
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,180
 But the challenge is, children in our city, thousands of children in our city, are growing

214
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,960
 up without a family.

215
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,960
 Our community is not supporting struggling families.

216
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,920
 And so we see kids spending years and years in care.

217
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,120
 And the problem with children spending years and years in care is that, and there's reason,

218
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,080
 this is global research, not just in Hong Kong, when children stay in care, the more

219
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,360
 years they stay in care, the longer they're there, the more likely they are to have both

220
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,120
 physical and mental health problems.

221
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,320
 They're more likely to drop out of school early.

222
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,080
 They are more likely to do drugs.

223
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,200
 They are more likely, especially if they're a boy, to end up in prison.

224
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,160
 In fact, it's something like almost 80% of men in prison in the United States grew up

225
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,520
 in foster care.

226
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,320
 So it's not just Hong Kong, okay?

227
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:50,160
 And if they are a girl, they are astronomically more likely to get pregnant between the ages

228
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,640
 of 12 and 18.

229
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,240
 Big challenge I always have is that people say to me, "Oh, these girls who come to Mother's

230
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,480
 Choice who are pregnant, they must be really bad girls.

231
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,880
 They must be really naughty girls.

232
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,080
 They've made bad choices."

233
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,240
 And I want to say to them, "They are children who've grown up without loving families, and

234
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,520
 they are vulnerable, and we should be protecting them."

235
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,360
 So you can see it's a vicious cycle, right?

236
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:20,120
 My youngest child is seven months old, and I regularly meet grandparents who are younger

237
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,900
 than I am.

238
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:31,360
 So this is a vicious cycle, and I want to ask the question this evening, what if Summer

239
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,120
 had a family?

240
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,920
 What if somebody had supported Summer's mom when she fell pregnant as a teenager and helped

241
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,220
 her to get off of drugs and helped her to raise her child?

242
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:51,320
 Or if that hadn't been possible, what if the people who were in charge of Summer when she

243
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,640
 was a newborn baby had believed in adoption, and she'd been given the chance to be raised

244
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,440
 in a loving family?

245
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,000
 To be a family like the ones here at this church?

246
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,680
 Would her life have been different?

247
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,560
 Would she have made different choices?

248
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:14,880
 Would she be a different person if she'd been raised with a mom and a dad who saw her potential,

249
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,200
 who believed in her, and who prepared her for life?

250
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,920
 I believe that Summer's life would look very different, and that's because God designed

251
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:33,000
 something that I believe is the most powerful agent of change in the world, and that is

252
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 family.

253
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,280
 God designed us for family.

254
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:46,680
 In fact, when we accepted Christ, we became members of God's family.

255
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:52,680
 Romans 8 tells us that we were adopted.

256
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,920
 We ourselves are adopted into God's family.

257
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,280
 That's what makes us his children.

258
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,340
 We are legal heirs.

259
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,440
 We are permanently adopted.

260
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,640
 We are legal heirs alongside Christ.

261
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,520
 Next month, November, is Adoption Awareness Month, celebrated around the world.

262
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:21,160
 But because of the untraditional mindset of many in our city, there's a great sense of

263
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,600
 shame and secrecy that surrounds the topic of adoption.

264
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,920
 We have a lot of cultural stigmas.

265
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:37,460
 There's beliefs that adoption is second best, that a family could really only love somebody

266
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:43,280
 that's their blood relation, and there are many who believe that to place a child for

267
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,040
 adoption is cruel.

268
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:52,560
 And so the result of all of that is there are many children who are waiting for adoption.

269
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,560
 Even though most kids aren't released for adoption, there are some who are.

270
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,440
 There's about 80 who are on the wait list right now in Hong Kong.

271
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,160
 And even though there are families who want to adopt in Hong Kong, they don't want to

272
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,720
 adopt the children who are waiting.

273
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,360
 Very, very few are willing, and that's because about half of the children who are waiting

274
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,560
 are over the age of three.

275
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,280
 They've been through the trauma of moving around and through different placements.

276
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,560
 And the other half, even though they're younger and there's more families willing to adopt

277
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:33,040
 younger children, they might have special needs or complex backgrounds, like Summer's.

278
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,440
 They may have been exposed to drugs in utero.

279
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,760
 Their parents may have had mental health issues or other physical health issues.

280
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,600
 And so there's just no families who are willing to step up and to adopt them.

281
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,400
 But here's the truth, the truth I want to speak out today over you.

282
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,200
 Every child is special.

283
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:04,320
 And even though these children I'm telling you about are vulnerable, they are so, so

284
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,280
 valuable.

285
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,060
 They deserve to have a safe, loving, and permanent family.

286
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,920
 And I also want to tell you this, every family is unique.

287
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:24,280
 It's love and commitment, not blood, that makes a family.

288
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,800
 And I also tell you this, families need support.

289
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,800
 I can't raise my children by myself.

290
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:35,880
 I told you there are spiritual sisters and aunts and uncles in this room who helped me

291
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,600
 to raise my children.

292
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,260
 We all need community.

293
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,200
 We all need people to support us.

294
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:49,200
 So everybody in this community and in this church has a role to play in supporting family.

295
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:56,480
 And these truths that I share with you, I believe it's at the very heart of the gospel.

296
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,520
 And that's because God loved us so much.

297
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,200
 He loved us so much that he adopted us into his family.

298
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,280
 And it's his heart to see the lonely in family.

299
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:16,360
 And that's what challenges us to care for the widow and the orphan.

300
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:23,000
 And so I want to challenge you today because I believe that those children who are languishing

301
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,600
 in institutional care across our city without a family, children like Summer, they are our

302
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,720
 modern day orphans in Hong Kong.

303
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,520
 And I believe that Summer's mom, and now Summer herself as a single mom, raising her older

304
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,020
 daughter on her own, they are our modern day widows.

305
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:52,880
 And it is our mission and all of our responsibility to respond.

306
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,280
 So what can you do?

307
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,120
 I know it's really scary to think about getting involved.

308
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,280
 I know you guys are a young congregation and some of you may not even be married yet and

309
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,080
 you think, "Oh, what can I do?"

310
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,780
 It's really, it's easier for everybody I think to think, "This is the government's problem.

311
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,700
 Let's just leave this to the government."

312
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:22,320
 I got to tell you something, there is no government on the planet that can replace the love and

313
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,760
 authentic relationship that you find in a family.

314
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,140
 It can't replace community.

315
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:36,860
 And that is what the families and people in this church can provide.

316
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,520
 You can provide genuine relationship.

317
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:46,580
 And there are thousands of children across our city and thousands of families in crisis

318
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,780
 who are suffering and who are longing to be in relationship, who are longing for somebody

319
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,940
 to love them and to walk alongside them.

320
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:58,960
 Okay, so some practical things about what you can do.

321
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,480
 The first thing that you can do is you can pray.

322
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,960
 I always ask myself, what if people of faith and our churches step forward to pray, not

323
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:17,540
 just for a moment, but prayed really intentionally and purposefully with commitment for children

324
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,060
 without families in our community?

325
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:27,220
 What if you went home tonight and you prayed with your own family and you asked God, "What's

326
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,540
 our mission as a family?

327
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,220
 How can we respond?"

328
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:38,620
 I wonder what would have happened in Summer's life if there had been a family or somebody

329
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:44,020
 who stepped up and said, "I'm going to fast and pray for you for 30 days."

330
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,500
 I wonder what could have happened.

331
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,940
 I also want to suggest something else.

332
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:58,020
 What if you step forward to support children and families in crisis just by building friendship

333
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,380
 with them, by being in relationship with them?

334
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:08,200
 What if you supported young birth parents, teen moms, or single moms?

335
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,400
 And I know you probably think you don't know anybody like that.

336
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,040
 You don't know anybody like Summer.

337
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,820
 That feels far away from your life.

338
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:21,060
 Well, I'll tell you that there are moms and dads and children and young people who are

339
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,500
 struggling in this very congregation.

340
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:29,500
 There are people who are having a really hard time and not sure that they can face their

341
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,740
 trials alone.

342
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:39,760
 So open your eyes, even today as you're leaving, and ask God, "Is there somebody who's lonely

343
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:45,000
 that I can be friend, that I can be family to?"

344
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:54,400
 Because when we as people of faith decide to meet the desperate need of children in

345
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:01,520
 our city, I just think, I told you there were 400 children on the wait list today.

346
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,740
 That's not that many families.

347
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:09,880
 What if we in the church decided that we wanted to meet that desperate need for foster families?

348
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,520
 What if we said, "I could foster a child.

349
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,060
 I'd be open to it."

350
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,980
 What if Summer, when she was younger, had been with a loving family, a family that prayed

351
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,140
 for her, that brought her to church even, that fought for her, that were a voice for

352
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,340
 her?

353
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:33,260
 And I think, what if there are people in this congregation that would even consider building

354
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,100
 their family through adoption?

355
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:42,980
 What if they think that there's somebody that they could love?

356
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:50,040
 I'm just telling you that there are so many children, and I think when you ask God what

357
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:59,440
 you can do, and you respond, even in a small way, you can make a difference.

358
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,060
 So I want to close by telling you this.

359
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:06,900
 We said that we're no longer slaves to fear.

360
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,660
 And I want to tell you not to be afraid.

361
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:16,780
 Because it's time for us as the church to step in, to respond to God's calling.

362
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:23,420
 You can pray, you can support struggling families or children or young people, even here in

363
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,620
 your own congregation.

364
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:33,280
 And I bet there's even people here who could be amazing foster families or even adopt.

365
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:42,060
 So as you think about it, ask God to open your heart, and I want to tell you that we

366
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,920
 need you.

367
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,740
 Because we need all of you.

368
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:54,180
 So I'll leave you with this.

369
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,860
 It takes teachers and mentors passing their wisdom to the next generation.

370
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,460
 It takes strong shoulders and pockets full of tissues in times of crisis.

371
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,200
 It takes carers awake in the night, keeping watch over a sick child.

372
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,400
 And it takes single parents who must be everything.

373
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:21,060
 It takes the brave who stare down their fears to make difficult decisions.

374
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:27,580
 It takes givers who let go of a piece of themselves so that a new family might be complete.

375
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,940
 And it takes those who walk beside them, sharing their load.

376
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:39,160
 It takes the honest who have hard conversations, no matter how difficult it gets.

377
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:47,740
 It takes comforters whose strong arms hold crying babies waiting for a home.

378
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:54,260
 And it takes the determined who won't rest until every child is in a family.

379
00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:00,160
 It takes new parents embarking on a bold adventure.

380
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:06,140
 And it takes those that see the potential in every child.

381
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:12,820
 It takes those who open their arms again and again to be a temporary family.

382
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,340
 And it takes those who open their hearts to be a forever family.

383
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:21,260
 Sometimes it takes the family you were born into.

384
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,220
 And sometimes the family you'd never have imagined.

385
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:35,540
 It takes mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters of all kinds.

386
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,940
 It takes us all.

387
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:52,940
