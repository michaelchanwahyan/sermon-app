[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Good evening.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Good evening.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   So, yeah, we've been looking at the heart of Jesus recently,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   a series looking at the heart of Jesus,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   taking a tour through the Gospels to see what Jesus did
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   and how he lived while here on earth.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   And we see his heart from the historical accounts
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   of how he healed people and how he preached
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   about the kingdom of heaven.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Now, the topic of today is how Jesus comforts.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Jesus has a heart that comforts.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   In the Gospel according to Mark, chapter 9,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Mark records an instance where Jesus comforts
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   a dad who was in distress.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Let's read from Mark, chapter 9, verse 14 again.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   "And when they," that's Jesus along with three of his disciples,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Peter, James, and John, "when they came to the disciples,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   they saw a great crowd around them and scribes arguing with them.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him."
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   So the scene is that Jesus comes down from a mountain
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and he's swarmed by a crowd.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   And overall, it's a lot of chaos.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Jesus' disciples and scribes in the crowd, everyone's arguing.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   They see Jesus, everyone runs up to him.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And so in verse 16, Jesus asks, "Hey, what's going on?
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   What are you arguing with them about?"
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   And then it's revealed,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   "Someone from the crowd answered him, 'Teacher, I brought my son to you,
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   for he has a spirit that makes him mute.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able."
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Okay, so now we see what's going on.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   There's a boy who's possessed by a spirit or alternatively a demon.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And so naturally, his dad's in distress.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   He cares for his son, and presumably after hearing about stories
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   of Jesus healing others, he brings his son to Jesus
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   and to his followers, hoping that Jesus may be able to heal him
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   and end his misery.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And so the father comes to Jesus, falls on his knees,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   and begs Jesus to heal his son.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Now again, we're looking at the heart of Jesus today,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   a heart that comforts.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And here we see a desperate father on his knees, begging Jesus to heal.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Surely now, surely now, Jesus is going to comfort this father.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Now let's see his comforting heart in verse 19.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   "And Jesus answered them, 'O faithless generation,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   how long am I to be with you?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   How long am I to bear with you?'"
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   What's going on?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   How is that comforting?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   "O faithless generation."
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   How's that comforting?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Imagine you're at the ICU at Hong Kong's Children's Hospital.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   A doctor walks into the waiting area.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   A dad runs up to him, grabs his hand, falls on his knees,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   pleads with him, "Help me, doctor.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   My son, he fell from the chair.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I gave him CPR, but he's not breathing.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Help me."
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And then the doctor, with all the care and concern that he can muster up,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   replies, "How long will I have to deal with you?"
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   That's the sort of picture that we're seeing in Mark 9 at this point.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Okay, so there you have it, folks.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Let's comfort as Jesus comforts.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Let's all give this a try this coming week.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Let's comfort others in this way.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   That's the moral of the story, right?
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So suppose your friend is going through a tough breakup.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   He knocks on your door.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   He's got half a tub of ice cream in one hand.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   He's got a spoon in the other and a lot of tissues.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And he's sobbing, and between spoonfuls--
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   If that's happening to you this week, this is what you can do.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Put your hand on his shoulder and say these magic words.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   "Oh, faithless generation."
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   (Laughter)
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Okay?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Or here's a fun one.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Next time you're at a funeral-- maybe a closed casket one, by the way--
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   picture this.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Everyone's crying.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   You walk up to the front, and you place your flower on the casket.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Off to your left, there's a grieving widow.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You take her hand, look her in the eye, and say,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   "Miss Taylor, I'm so, so sorry
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   that I have to deal with this faithless generation."
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   (Laughter)
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Is that what we're meant to do?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Copy and paste what Jesus did in this situation?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I don't quite think so.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And don't get me wrong.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Jesus is being caring and comforting here.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   He does have a heart that comforts.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   He's not out to be a jerk.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   And in order to see that today,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   let's first look at the problems that Jesus addresses in this story.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   What are the problems here that require comfort in the first place?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I see two problems.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   First, the obvious problem is that this boy is--
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   he's literally demon-possessed.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   He's possessed by a demon, and that's a pretty big problem.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   There's a spirit that prevents the boy from speaking.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   First, he's mute.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   But not only that, the spirit seizes him.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   The spirit takes the boy and slams him into the ground.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Matthew's account of the same incident in chapter 17 says
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   the demon even throws the boy sometimes into fire and water.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's trying to harm this kid.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   It makes him foam at the mouth like a rabid animal.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   It makes him grind his teeth.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Or it makes him rigid like a board, unable to move.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   He's either tossed around violently or he's paralyzed, unable to move.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And no wonder the dad is in distress.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   To all the parents in the room, I don't know what that would feel like.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I don't have kids, but imagine if that was your child.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   His son is possessed by a demon.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   He's suffering.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   He's afflicted.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And that's problem number one.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   There's also a second problem in this narrative.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   The problem is this.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   The people around Jesus lack faith.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   They all lack faith--the father, the disciples, the scribes,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   the rest of the crowd.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   They don't fully know Jesus.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   They don't completely trust in him.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   And that's the second problem.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And if we look at why there's chaos in the crowd so far,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   it's firstly because the boy is demon-possessed.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   But more than that, the father says in verse 18,
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   "I asked your disciples to cast out the demon, and they were not able."
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   The chaos is also because the disciples were unable to help this boy.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And what's the reason given for why they couldn't help?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Jesus immediately rebukes everyone in verse 19, saying,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   "Calling them a faithless generation, and that's not without reason."
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   The disciples were unable to help because they lacked faith.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And it's not only the disciples who are faithless.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The boy's father also didn't believe.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   As he goes to Jesus, we see a lot of desperation in him,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   but not much faith so far.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   There's not much faith that he truly believes that Jesus can help him.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And so far, we've only heard from him that the disciples were unable to do anything.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Let's read on from verse 20.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   [reading]
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   See, Jesus didn't like hearing what the dad said.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   "If you can." Jesus picks up on this immediately.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   "If you can help me."
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That betrays the dad's inner doubts about him.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   The dad's verbally hedging his bets that Jesus can help him.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   He doesn't fully believe that this is possible.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Compare this dad to the others that we've heard about in the past weeks.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Paul preached on Mark 5 a few weeks ago.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   There was a woman who fought through the crowd to touch Jesus
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   because she believed that if I touch even his garment, I will be made well.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   We also heard of the centurion who asked Jesus to heal his servant.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   He said, "I'm unworthy for you to come into my house,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   but you have authority just like how I, the centurion, has authority over my soldiers."
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   The centurion says, "Go," and the soldiers go.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Similarly, Jesus can say, "Be healed," and he will be healed.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   At that Jesus marvel, truly I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Remember the leper in Mark 1.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   He came to the Jesus with faith, saying that if you will, you can make me clean.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   You can make me clean.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   He trusted. He knew that Jesus could heal him.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   The leper's question is, "Are you willing, Jesus?"
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Instead, the father says, "Can you do it? Can you even do this? Are you able?"
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   The dad lacks faith, and Jesus calls him out for it.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   But then we get to verse 24, and this is a crucial point in the story.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   This is a key point.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   It goes like this.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   "Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, 'I believe. Help my unbelief.'"
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   These are the key words today.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   "I believe. Help my unbelief."
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   If you remember just three words today, remember this.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   "Help my unbelief."
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I can sympathize a bit with the dad.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   It's understandable why he has doubts.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Number one, he's dealing with this demon in his son for so long.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   In verse 24, Jesus asks the father, "How long has this been happening to him?"
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And the father says, "From childhood."
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   That has to be stressful.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   For years and years, the dad watched in pain as the demon broke down his son and destroyed the one he loves.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   For years, he was unable to do anything.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Then he hears of this miracle worker, Jesus.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   This guy can make the blind see. He can make the lame walk. He can cast out demons.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And his disciples were doing the same.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So he brings his son over, hoping that they can heal him.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   But what happens?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   They can't do it. The disciples are useless.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And in that case, it may be understandable to think,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   if the disciples can't do it, maybe it's all just a sham.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Maybe Jesus can't do it either.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I don't know.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And on top of that, when they bring the son to Jesus, it gets even worse.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   In verse 20, it says, "When the spirit saw Jesus, immediately it convulsed the boy,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   and he fell to the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth."
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   So far, it looks like turning to Jesus didn't help anything.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   And if anything, it made the situation even worse.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And I wonder if we felt that way about anything like that before in our lives.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   It's something that we've wanted or prayed about for a while,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   but yet nothing happened.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   It's one thing to know God and trust him in our heads,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   but it's also a constant fight to live it out by faith day by day.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Those who know me know that I love God's sovereignty.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   That is a truth that I find my joy and rest in, in God's promises.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   I know that God works all things for the good of those who love him,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   that he will supply every need of yours,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   But I have to admit that sometimes my faith wavers.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   For example, a while back, I had problems with a romantic relationship.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I wanted it to work out one way and had some hopes and expectations for it,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   but when things didn't go the way I want, I got anxious and worried.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   I had my eyes set on an uncertain situation
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   rather than on the unshakable promises of God.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   I needed to pray, "Lord, I believe, I do believe.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Help my unbelief.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I know, God, that you will never leave me or forsake me.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I know that the Lord is my helper. I will not fear.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   What can man do to me?"
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   But on the other hand, I need to say, "Father, I'm weak, I'm short-sighted,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   and I need you. Help my unbelief."
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Like this dad, are there troubles in your life
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   that cause you to doubt God's goodness?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Maybe a loved one that's sick, could be dating, relationships.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Maybe you've been praying for years and years and nothing's happened.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   For parents, maybe like this dad, you pray for your son or daughter.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Perhaps they took a wrong turn at some point.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   They're chasing after the world and turned away from God.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   You've been praying for years and nothing happened.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I invite all of us to turn to Jesus and pray as the dad prayed.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   "I believe. Help my unbelief."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   I've prayed to him. I've been discouraged. It's been years, Lord,
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   and I've seen nothing changed.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Or maybe the situation just caught me by surprise. I don't know what to do.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   I want to pray, but I don't even know how to pray.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   But even so, we can pray. "Help my unbelief."
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Jesus hears these prayers and he comforts those who are weak and weary.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   He helps us even when our faith is weak.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   And I think that also is what true faith actually is.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   When we recognize that we are weak and we can't save ourselves,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   that we need Jesus and then cry out to him for help.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Maybe also there's some of us here that don't know Jesus yet or believe in him.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Or you've heard about him recently and want to believe.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   You could be or you could have been attending church for a while,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   but still you know that something's missing about your faith.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   You don't really worship God or you see how others worship
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   and you know somehow you don't love him the same way.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   Maybe at the back of your mind there's nagging doubts.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   You're not sure whether God really exists or whether he truly loves you and cares for you.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Perhaps you're at a crossroads and you either need to be cut to the heart with the gospel
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   or you're ready to give it up entirely.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   If that's the case with you, I also invite you to pray. "Help my unbelief."
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Even if you can't say, "I believe," you can still say, "I don't believe, but I want to. Help my unbelief."
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Take that step however small to seek Jesus.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And that step of saying, "I can't do it. Help me, God," when said earnestly,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   is part of what true faith actually is.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Faith sees that we need a savior. We can't save ourselves, so we cry out to him.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   1 Peter 5 says, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   so that at the proper time he may exalt you,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   casting all your anxieties on him because he cares for you."
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   You see, Jesus comes, he invites us to come to him as we are.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Even if we don't believe in him, even when our faith is weak, we can call out to him.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   "Help my unbelief." Jesus helps us when we're weak.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Secondly, Jesus answers and works to build our faith.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   He helps us when we're weak, but he also works to build our faith up.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Let's read on from verse 25.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   See, long story short, Jesus managed to cast the demon out and heal the boy. Nice.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   But before that, the dad went through a long journey.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   The dad was disappointed by the disciple's uselessness.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   He was on his knees and also desperately pleading with Jesus,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   only to be greeted with a rebuke.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Then as Jesus went to his son and claimed to cast out the demon,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   now the spirit convulsed and afflicted the boy even more,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   to the point that the boy appeared to be dead even.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   The boy appeared to be dead.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Now Jesus could have healed the boy immediately.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   He was certainly able to.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Or if God didn't permit it in the first place, the demon would have no power over the son.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   But I think that Jesus allowed all of this to happen for a reason.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   In order to bring the dad to the point where he had no other choice but to cry out to Jesus,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   saying, "Help my unbelief."
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   He used suffering to refine this dad's faith.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And in the same way, God also uses trials and suffering in our life to draw us to him.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   1 Peter 1:6 says,
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   God uses suffering to refine our faith so that we could have this eternal joy,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   this thing that is precious.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   We observed earlier that there are two problems in this passage.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   The first is that there is a demon-possessed boy,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   and the second is that there is unbelief.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   If we also zoom out to look more broadly at the Gospels,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   we see that there are two big things that Jesus has been doing so far.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Number one is that he has been performing miracles,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   mainly healing people and casting out demons, as with the boy here.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Number two, he has been preaching and proclaiming the kingdom of God.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Mark 1 says,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   But if we squint at it, both actions, the healing and the preaching,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   are actually part of the same mission.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   They both serve to testify of who Jesus is.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   First, he is revealed as someone who is sent by God to declare his kingdom coming.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Jesus is a prophet declaring the kingdom of God.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   And then later, as his ministry progresses,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   it is revealed that Jesus, this prophet, is also the Christ, the Messiah,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   who will save the world.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   He is the one who is anointed and chosen by God to save his people.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   So Jesus both declares the Gospel with words in his preaching,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   and then performs signs and wonders to confirm that his message is credible.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   The heart of Jesus, both in his healing and preaching,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   is that Jesus wants people to believe in him
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   and have faith that he will redeem them from their sins.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And here we see that Jesus healed because he is compassionate.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   That is true.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   The Father appeals to that, asking Jesus in verse 22,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   "Have compassion on us."
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   And a couple weeks ago, we also heard about how Jesus healed the leper in Mark 1
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   because he was moved with pity and compassion for him, the leper.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   But his compassion isn't only for physical illnesses.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   It surely is.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   But it's also towards our unbelief.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Because Mark 6, 34 says,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   "When Jesus went ashore, he saw a great crowd,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   "and he had compassion on them,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   "because they were like sheep without a shepherd."
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   These people were like sheep without a shepherd
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   because of their lack of faith, because of unbelief.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   They didn't know God and lost their way as a result.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   And Jesus had compassion on them for that reason,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   because of their lack of faith.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   And then out of his compassion, what does he do?
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   He began to teach them many things.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   He taught them out of compassion for their unbelief.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   And the point is this,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   that Jesus heals not out of only compassion towards physical illnesses,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   but also from compassion towards our spiritual illnesses,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   towards our lack of faith.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   His ministry of healing works alongside his ministry of proclamation.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   His miracles testify that Jesus, he is the real deal,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   that what he says is true.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   In Mark 1, Jesus was teaching in the synagogue,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   and all of a sudden, another demon-possessed man interrupts
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   and causes a commotion.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And then Jesus commands the spirit, saying,
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   "Be silent and come out of him."
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And the spirit obeys.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Later in verse 27, it says,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   "That they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   'What is this, a new teaching with authority?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.'"
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   The one who has authority over the demon to say,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   "Be silent and come out of him,"
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   that Jesus has the same authority to say to us,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   The miracles testify that Jesus is sent from God.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And now it's also interesting that when the dad asks, "Help my unbelief,"
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   how does Jesus respond?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   He responds by healing the boy.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And now perhaps Jesus answered that cry by giving the dad faith
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   that made the healing possible,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   but I consider the act of healing itself
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   to be an answer to the dad's prayer of helping his unbelief.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Jesus addresses the dad's unbelief by doing what he said he could do.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   He showed that he was able to heal precisely by healing the boy,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   by the act of healing him.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   He showed himself worthy of our faith.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   That's how he helped the dad's unbelief.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And I think the same is true also when we talk about healing
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   and other miraculous works of the spirit today,
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   or how God answers our prayers.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   He answers because God loves us and is compassionate towards us,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   but he's not just compassionate towards our physical ailments.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   He wants to strengthen our faith in him.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And there's some of us here who can testify to how they came to know God
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   more closely when he healed them or a loved one.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   I think of Florence's family. That's one example.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I'm sure there's other testimonies.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   But the miracles and gifts of the spirit are not ends in themselves.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   They're gifts given to build up the church
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   and to demonstrate that Jesus is who he really claimed to be.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   As Hebrews 2 says,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   So that's why there's signs and wonders performed by Jesus and maybe now today.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And what's this great salvation declared in Hebrews 2?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   What's the message that God confirms with signs and wonders?
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   If we read on in Mark 2, verse 31, Jesus tells his disciples,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   You see, Jesus' mission wasn't just to preach and heal.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   His ultimate mission was to die on the cross for our sins.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   Jesus came to put death to death and to make an end of our sins.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Jesus, the innocent son of man and son of God,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   was murdered on the cross for our sake.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   He willingly gave his life up for us and bore the wrath of God on our behalf
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   so that all who believe in him would be forgiven of their sins.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And Jesus didn't just die, but he performed the ultimate miracle on the third day.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   He rose from the dead, proving that he is the son of God
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   and that he is worthy of our faith,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   that he is worthy for us to deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow him.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Just as Jesus raised the boy in verse 27 and proved that he is able to heal,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Jesus rose from the dead and demonstrated that he is worthy of our full trust and adoration.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   And so, because Jesus died and rose, we can cry to him,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   "I believe, help my unbelief."
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Jesus died and rose from the dead to purchase for us this prayer, "Help my unbelief."
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   These healings, these miracles are witnesses and signs.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   They are a shadow of the good thing that has come.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Every healing is an act of God's mercy.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Every prayer answered, a testament to God's goodness.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Every miracle, an announcement that God's kingdom is here and that there's more to come.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   They point us forward to the day when all is made new,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   to look forward to that day when we will see God face to face
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   and hear that he will dwell with them and they will be his people,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   and God himself will be with them as their God.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   He will wipe every tear from their eyes and death will be no more.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore,
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   for the former things have passed away.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   And we will all praise him for all eternity, saying, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain."
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   That's what Jesus bought for us.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   And when Jesus answers our prayers, when he does signs and wonders,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   by rising from the dead, Jesus helps our unbelief.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   So we see that Jesus helps us when we're weak in faith, firstly.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   And secondly, Jesus also works to build up our faith.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   He did it by his atoning death on the cross,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   and he also did it by healing this boy and answering this dad's prayers.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Lastly, thirdly, we see that Jesus also helps us when we ask him in faith.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Let's read from verse 28.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   "And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him in private,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   'Why could we not cast it out?'
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   And he said to them, 'This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.'"
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Remember we saw earlier that the disciples weren't able to cast out the demon,
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   and they were wondering why.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   They asked Jesus, and he answers them,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   "Guys, you need to pray. You need to pray."
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And isn't that kind of funny that the disciples tried to cast out a demon,
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   a literal demon, without thinking to pray?
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Imagine that, the disciples rocking up to an exorcism, forgetting to pray.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   There's a demon-possessed boy. He's going crazy.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   They can't control him. They can't do anything.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Nothing is working.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   And still somehow, they neglect to pray.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Why is that?
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Matthew gives a parallel account of this story.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   There, the disciples ask the same question in Matthew 17, verse 19.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   They ask, "Why could we not cast it out?"
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And Jesus replies, "Because of your little faith.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed,
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,'
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you."
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   In other words, Jesus is saying that if you have faith, then you will pray.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   And God will listen, and he will act.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Nothing is impossible for God.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   See, the disciples couldn't cast out the demon because they lacked faith.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And because they had little faith, they didn't pray.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And now, before we get too smug of ourselves,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   making fun of the disciples for trying to exorcise a demon without praying,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   we also ought to examine ourselves as well.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   Do we always pray as earnestly as we ought to pray?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Or maybe, like the disciples, we're looking a bit silly sometimes.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And I'll be the first to say, I don't pray enough.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Honestly, when preparing to preach for today, I was staring at this passage,
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   working hard to understand it, reading, trying to organize my thoughts.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   And then it hit me. I just really needed to pray
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   in order to understand and deliver to you what God had to say.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   Nothing I say has power unless God's Spirit works in your hearts, works in our hearts.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   I've also even caught myself sharing the Gospel recently
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   without adequate prayer, without stopping to pray.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   And that's crazy, isn't it?
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Because it's God who removes the veil from blind eyes and shines light into dark hearts.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   We can do nothing without God.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   And if we really trust Jesus when he says that,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   "I am the vine, you are the branches.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   "Abide in me and I in you, and you will bear much fruit.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   "Apart from me, you can do nothing."
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   If we trust that, and if we trust that it is God who works in us,
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   both to will and to work for our good pleasure,
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   then we need to pray.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And if we don't pray, if we don't pray like this, then we can pray.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Help my unbelief.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Psalm 127 says,
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   "Unless the Lord builds a house, those who build it labor in vain.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   "Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchmen stay awake in vain.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   "It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest."
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   And I add to that, that's all because we do not pray.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   And so we need to pray.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Help my unbelief.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Help my unbelief.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   Why would we want to do anything without asking God to help us?
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   He promises that with faith the size of even a mustard seed,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   even the tiniest smidgen of faith, God will move mountains for us.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Do we believe this or are we trying to move the mountain ourselves?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Imagine hiking up Dragon's Back with a shovel in one hand
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   and a metal bucket in the other,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   thinking because if this mountain is going to move anywhere,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I've got to start digging.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   It's all on me, one scoop at a time to do this.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   And while we're sweating and driving our shovel in the ground,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   we wonder why is this such difficult work?
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   Why is this so hard?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Why am I sweating so much?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   That's the picture when we try to do things without prayer.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   God could send all of Hong Kong Island to Macau with so much as a word.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   He wouldn't even have to lift a finger.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And this same God is waiting to hear our prayers.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   He's waiting to work on our behalf.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   Isaiah 64 says, "For since the world began, no eye has heard,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   "no ear has heard, and no eye has seen a God like you
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   "who works for those who wait for him."
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Church, our God listens when we pray, and he loves to hear our prayers.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   He hears and he acts according to his good pleasure.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   So we need to pray.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Last thing, how do we pray in faith?
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   What does that mean?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   First, what it is, and then what it isn't.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   We should pray with faith that God is both able and willing to answer our prayers,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   that God is able.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Faith doesn't say, like the dad, "If you can do anything."
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Faith says, "You can do anything.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   "I believe you, God.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   "You can heal him.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   "You can save her.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   "You can do it without even lifting a finger."
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   And if you can't pray that, if we can't believe that,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   then we already know what to pray.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   "Help my unbelief.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   "I want to pray more.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   "Help my unbelief."
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Praying with faith is knowing not just that God is able,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   but that he's also willing to hear our prayers.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   We know we have boldness and access to God with confidence through our faith in Christ.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   And we can pray for things that God is pleased to do.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   This doesn't mean that God will necessarily do all that we ask all the time.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   For example, not everyone will be saved,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   even though God desires that all people to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   But we can still ask him in confidence that he loves to save.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Or we will continue to sin in this life,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   but we can still pray with confidence that God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   So we can pray according to God's will for the things that please him.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   And we can know what is God's will by reading his word and storing it up in our hearts
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   so that we're transformed by the renewal of our minds,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   that by testing, we may discern what is the will of God.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   And so we can pray accordingly.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Let's pray with faith that God is both able and willing to answer our prayers.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And now, what isn't?
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   So praying with faith isn't some new age, self-help type of prayer
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   where we just manifest and conjure up the life that we want.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Faith doesn't come up from false hope in whatever outcome we want
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   and then deluding ourselves to believe it.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   There's no promise that we can name and claim whatever we want.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   There's no guarantee that we will be rich if we believe hard enough
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   or that that person will surely be healed.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   And if we deceive ourselves, God doesn't promise that he'll play along.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Instead, faith is the confident assurance of truth, the hope of realities, of substance,
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   not just whims and illusions.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   And we can guard ourselves with praying based on the truth revealed in God's word
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   and by testing our desires and our prayers according to it.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And as we pray and we surrender our will to God,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   I believe that God's spirit is able, that he does and can give a special revelation
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   or a gift of faith as he sees fit so that we know how to pray for a specific outcome.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Perhaps to know that particular person will be healed.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   That's a gift that God gives.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   We can ask God in prayer to give us some special gift of faith.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   And if he gives us that gift, if he gives us that assurance,
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   then we can pray with confident assurance that we have received it
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   just as his spirit has revealed to us.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   But if not, then I don't think it's wise to conjure up, to create confidence
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   in something that God has not given us reason to be confident about.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   I don't think that's what it means to pray in faith.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   But to sum it all up, again today, we've been looking at the heart of Jesus that comforts.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Jesus comforts us by meeting us where we are, even when we're weak.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   He helps us when we're weak and lacking in faith.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   He invites us to call on him and to trust in him in our weakness.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   But he doesn't let us stay weak. He doesn't keep us weak.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   He works to build up our faith.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   He uses both blessings and trials in our life to show that he's trustworthy.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   And the greatest miracle that he did for us was dying on the cross for our sins
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   and rising on the third day.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   And finally, when we have faith, when we have this true trust in Jesus,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   we can find comfort that God really hears our prayers when we pray with faith.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   He hears us and he listens and he acts.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   So let's pray more. Let's cry to him, "Help my unbelief."
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   For some of us here, the prayers might be, "I don't believe. Help my unbelief."
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   For others, it's, "I know you. I know you, God. I believe you, Father.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   Help my unbelief. Help me to trust you more. I want to love you more every day.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I want to see you more beautifully every day. Help my unbelief."
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   And as fitting, we're going to pray now, but I'm going to ask the band today to remain seated
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   because today we're all going to focus and pray together as a church.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   We're not praying after the sermon to stall for time, to set up for a smooth transition.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   We're praying because we trust that God hears our prayers.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   And if there's an awkward silence when they come up later, that's fine.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   We can continue to pray while they set up.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   We can pray individually in silence.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   And we're going to pray like this today because we believe.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   We believe that God hears our prayers, that he listens, that he loves us and cares for us.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   He comforts us.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   And if we don't believe that today, then right now we can pray, "Help my unbelief."
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   So let's pray.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Father, we look to you.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   Some of us here can't say we believe in God, but we, God, we ask,
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   we trust that you know your sheep, you know your people, you love to save.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   If there's anyone here today that needs to cry, "Help my unbelief, Lord,"
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   we pray that you would answer that prayer for them,
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   that they would see Christ, call on him by faith, and be saved.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   We trust that your Spirit can do that, that you shine light into dark hearts.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   For us, the church, God, we also pray that you would teach us to pray.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   We confess, we repent that we don't pray as we ought to.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   God, we ask, "Help our unbelief. Help us. Give us more faith to pray, to pray big things,
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   to trust, to know in confidence that you hear our prayers, that you are God,
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   that you're bigger than all our problems, that you're able and willing to help us."
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   God, we pray for our church in this new season,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   that you would work, not just to make this transition to Sunday smooth,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   but that, God, this would be the beginning of a great new season that you're doing in our church,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   that you would make us a church that goes and makes disciples of all nations,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   that is passionate, that is on fire to see people come to know you,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   to see disciples being raised,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   that we would be bold to go preach the gospel to our coworkers, our friends, to draw people to you,
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   and that we would desire to get to know you more, that we'd be passionate to worship you,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   that we would be a church that is a light in the city,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   that the city, your spirit would move in all of us,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   just to love you, to worship you,
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   and that you would send us out to the ends of the earth where Christ has not been named,
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   to preach Christ to peoples that don't know you.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   We pray for governments and authorities that oppress your church.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   We pray that your spirit would move in their hearts to repent,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   that they would be our brothers and sisters,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   that they would confess Christ, they would call on his name and be saved.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   We trust that you can do this, that you love to save all people.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   And so, Lord, help us to pray more.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Help us to pray as we go into work, as we go into school,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   in everything that we do, the work we do with our hands.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   When work gets tough, Lord, help us to pray.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Teach us to pray even when we're at work 10 hours a day,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   focusing on what's in front of us.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Teach us to pray.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   Teach us to pray for our friends, our families, our coworkers that don't know you.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   To fall on our knees and beg that you can heal them,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   help my unbelief, you can heal them, you can save them.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And, Lord, would you answer.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   God, we pray that we would be a praying church,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   a church that calls on you by faith, that sees you.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Lord, you are able to work in our hearts.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   So we pray, help our unbelief, help us to see you more, Lord.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   We pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.840]   Amen.
