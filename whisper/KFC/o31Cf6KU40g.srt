00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Samantha

390
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
你剛剛

391
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
是不是?

392
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
等候了神

393
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
進了大學

394
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
那你可能Just out of a Trial

395
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
是不是?

396
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Just out of a Trial

397
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
OK

398
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
我們每個人呢

399
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
都是有一個情況的

400
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
OK

401
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
那之前呢

402
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
我們讀了Acts 1

403
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
那些門徒呢

404
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
都是有一個情況的

405
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
是不是?

406
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
他們的情況是什麼呢?

407
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
我們看看

408
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
他們不同的情況

409
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
他們的領袖呢

410
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
是誰呢?

411
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
他們的領袖是主耶穌

412
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
祂死了

413
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
復活了

414
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
然後又升上天堂

415
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
然後呢

416
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
他們又可能混淆了

417
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
是不是?

418
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
主耶穌真的是誰呢?

419
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
祂是神來的

420
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
祂剛剛升上天堂

421
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
然後

422
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
祂是不是下個星期回來呢?

423
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
是不是幾天又回來呢?

424
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
還是很久才回來呢?

425
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
他們混淆了

426
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
是不是?

427
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
他們有點混淆

428
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
主耶穌是誰呢?

429
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
祂什麼時候會回來呢?

430
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
他們都不是很清楚

431
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
是不是?

432
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
然後呢

433
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
他們又不是很清楚

434
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
聖靈是誰呢?

435
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
聖靈會來

436
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Jesus說

437
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
聖靈會來

438
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
但是祂會來幫我們什麼呢?

439
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
祂會教我們什麼呢?

440
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
祂會領我們去做什麼呢?

441
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
我不是很清楚

442
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
是不是?

443
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
然後呢

444
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
他們都很害怕

445
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
那些羅曼斯

446
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
是不是?

447
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
那些羅曼斯可能是去

448
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
找他們

449
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
找他們

450
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
這些是主耶穌的門徒

451
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
祂在哪裡?

452
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
找他們出來

453
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
他們有沒有搞事?

454
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
是不是?

455
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
他們跟隨主耶穌

456
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
他們之前可能跟隨主耶穌去搞事

457
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
是不是?

458
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
所以這些門徒

459
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
是在受審嗎?

460
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
還是只是在被審問?

461
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
是不是?

462
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
這些門徒

463
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
都是很迷茫的

464
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
在這個時間

465
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
那麼

466
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
這個迷茫

467
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
這個受審的時間

468
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
這些門徒做了什麼呢?

469
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
他們等候的時候

470
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
他們做了什麼呢?

471
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
你猜他們做了什麼?

472
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
你猜他們做了什麼?

473
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
你猜啊

474
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
什麼?

475
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
上班?

476
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
是不是回去釣魚?

477
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
我們等候神

478
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
剛剛主耶穌

479
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
上了天

480
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
我回去釣魚

481
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
是不是?

482
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
可能啊

483
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
可能啊

484
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
可能

485
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
我們看看

486
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
第一章第二段

487
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
第二章第一章的第二段

488
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
然後聖徒們

489
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
一起讀

490
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
英文

491
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
1,2,3

492
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
然後聖徒們回到耶穌基督的教堂

493
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
從山頂的

494
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
聖母塔

495
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
在聖誕節時

496
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
他們從城裡走來

497
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
他們到達時

498
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
他們走到房間

499
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
他們住的房間

500
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
那些人在場的

501
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
是彼得

502
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
約翰

503
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
詹姆斯和安德魯

504
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
菲利普和托馬斯

505
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
巴爾多拉米爾和馬丁

506
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
詹姆斯

507
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
埃爾維亞斯和塞門德塞勒

508
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
和朱德斯

509
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
詹姆斯的兒子

510
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
他們都在祈禱中

511
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
不斷地聚在一起

512
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
與女人在一起

513
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
與耶穌的母親

514
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
和他的兄弟結婚

515
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
我們看到

516
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
門徒們在做什麼?

517
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
在這個審訊的時間

518
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
他們做了什麼?

519
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
他們做了什麼?

520
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
答案在這裡

521
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
他們在聽

522
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
主耶穌叫他們做什麼?

523
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
耶穌叫他們去耶路撒冷

524
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
去等什麼?

525
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
去等聖靈

526
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
等聖靈來到

527
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
等待耶穌

528
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
他們在聽耶穌的指令

529
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
耶穌的聖靈會來

530
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
他們在聽

531
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
他們在聽耶穌的指令

532
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
第二

533
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
他們做什麼?

534
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Samantha剛剛說的

535
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
奉行

536
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
然後就是祈禱

537
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
在第14:13說

538
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,000
他們在祈禱中不斷地聚在一起

539
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
他們在祈禱

540
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
等候主耶穌說的聖靈來

541
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
他們不斷地等待

542
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
不斷地在祈禱

543
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
第一他們是奉行的

544
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
第二是祈禱

545
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
第二他們是怎樣?

546
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
我們繼續讀

547
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Peter stood up among the believers and said

548
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Brothers and sisters, the scripture has been fulfilled

549
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago

550
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
through David concerning Judas

551
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
who served as a guide for those who arrested Jesus

552
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He was one of our number and shared in our ministry

553
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Four, Peter said

554
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It is written in the book of Psalms

555
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
My place has been deserted

556
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Let there be no one to dwell in it

557
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
May another take his place of leadership

558
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Peter then read the Bible

559
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The Old Testament

560
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What did he see?

561
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He saw a prophecy

562
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
that someone would betray Jesus

563
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Who would betray Jesus?

564
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Judas

565
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
We read it before

566
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Judas son of James

567
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Judas son of James

568
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
was not the same Judas who betrayed Jesus

569
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Do you know what happened after Judas betrayed Jesus?

570
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What did he do?

571
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He committed suicide

572
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He hung himself

573
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
He was so ashamed or embarrassed or suffering

574
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Suffering through what he had done

575
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Judas betrayed Jesus and he hung himself

576
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Peter saw the Old Testament

577
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He said, "OK"

578
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The Old Testament predicted

579
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The Holy Spirit predicted

580
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
that this event would happen

581
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Jesus would be betrayed

582
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But what would happen to us?

583
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He saw it in Psalms

584
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
May his place be deserted

585
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Let no one dwell in his place

586
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And may another take the place of leadership

587
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
May another take the place of leadership

588
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
They saw in the Old Testament

589
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What is the leadership of God?

590
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Leading them to recruit another person

591
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
To take their place

592
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
We see in this passage

593
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Peter looked into Scripture as the foundation

594
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They waited for God

595
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What did they do?

596
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They read the Bible

597
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
They saw the Old Testament

598
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The Old Testament predicted that this event would happen

599
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What should we do?

600
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We should recruit another person

601
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Another person to take his place

602
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
OK

603
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Third, when they waited for the Holy Spirit

604
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What did they do?

605
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
They looked for God's leading

606
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
They looked for God's leading

607
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Therefore, it says in verse 21

608
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It is necessary to choose one of the men

609
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Who have been with us the whole time

610
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The Lord Jesus was living among us

611
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So they nominated two men

612
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Joseph and another called Matthias

613
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
They prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart

614
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Show us which of these two

615
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You have chosen to take over this ministry"

616
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
They cast lots

617
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The lot fell on Matthias

618
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
He was added to the eleven apostles

619
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What did they do?

620
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
They prayed

621
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They waited for God to lead them

622
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
They looked for God's leading

623
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
They prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart

624
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You know our hearts

625
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Show us which of these two men you have chosen"

626
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
They looked for God's leading

627
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
They looked for God's leading

628
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
OK

629
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The disciples

630
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Let's recap

631
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
The disciples

632
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
In the next slide

633
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What did the disciples do?

634
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The first is they obeyed and they prayed

635
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
They obeyed and they prayed

636
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They went to Jerusalem

637
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
They waited for the Holy Spirit

638
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Then they were constantly in prayer

639
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Constantly in prayer

640
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Then they read the Bible

641
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
They read the Old Testament

642
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
They read the Bible

643
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The prophets predicted this event

644
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The prophets predicted this event

645
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Then what?

646
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
They waited for God's leading

647
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
They looked for God's leading

648
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
God, you lead us

649
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Which disciple to choose

650
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
To take over this ministry

651
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The fourth is we see in this scripture

652
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
They have a supportive community

653
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
They have a supportive ministry

654
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
When they wait for the Holy Spirit

655
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
OK

656
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Now we will invite Lucas to speak his testimony

657
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
OK

658
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Let's give him a round of applause

659
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Lucas, come up and speak your testimony

660
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Hello

661
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I will talk about how I wait for God

662
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It was about a year ago

663
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I was a transfer student

664
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I was in the 7th grade

665
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I was in the 2nd grade

666
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I was bullied all the time

667
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I was beaten

668
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I was thrown away

669
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I was kicked and beaten

670
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It was painful

671
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I was like this every day

672
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I went back to school

673
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I couldn't read

674
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I walked away

675
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
My books were scattered

676
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I went to the toilet

677
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
My books were scattered

678
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I was on the floor

679
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
It was painful

680
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I prayed to God

681
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
God, I feel so bad

682
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Can you let me go?

683
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I feel so bad

684
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Nothing happened

685
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I was beaten

686
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I was kicked and pushed to the wall

687
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I was kicked and kicked on the stairs

688
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I was kicked on the stairs

689
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I was kicked on the stairs

690
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I was scared

691
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I felt unsafe going back to school

692
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
My teacher didn't help me

693
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I didn't care

694
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I was unhappy

695
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I was in the 8th grade

696
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
It was like this

697
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
There was a teacher

698
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
She was my teacher

699
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
She always targeted me

700
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,000
She threw my books outside

701
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
It was a mountain outside

702
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I couldn't pick them up

703
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I went back to the classroom

704
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I said, "Teacher, my books were thrown away"

705
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
She yelled at me

706
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
What excuse is that?

707
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
How dare you to lie to me?

708
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I was punished

709
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Detention

710
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I was sent to the detention

711
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
For 3 or 4 times

712
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Wow!

713
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You were punished by a classmate

714
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Your teacher treated you like this

715
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Wow!

716
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I cried

717
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I prayed to God

718
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I asked the teacher

719
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I said, "Teacher, I'm in pain

720
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Can you help me?

721
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I'm so unhappy"

722
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
It was like this

723
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I was punished

724
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I was punished

725
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I didn't change anything

726
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I had to avoid it

727
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I had to walk away

728
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Even my friends

729
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
They didn't dare to play with me

730
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
One of my friends told me

731
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
She said, "I can't play with you"

732
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Why?

733
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Because if I play with you

734
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'll be punished

735
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I can't play with you

736
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
If I'm punished, I'll be scolded

737
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I can't do that

738
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Wow!

739
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I cried

740
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I thought

741
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I was back to school

742
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I was punished

743
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I was scolded

744
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
The teachers criticized me

745
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Once

746
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
On the wedding website

747
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Someone wrote my name

748
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
They scolded me

749
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They asked me why I went there

750
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Of course, I was punished

751
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I thought

752
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You punished me

753
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
The teachers punished me

754
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
My classmates punished me

755
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Even my friends left me

756
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Wow!

757
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I cried

758
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I prayed to God

759
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I told God

760
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Let me go

761
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't want to stay here

762
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
One year passed

763
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Year 9

764
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I was scolded again

765
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Then, the pandemic came

766
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
The pandemic was good

767
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I didn't have to go to school

768
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
My grades improved

769
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Everything improved

770
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I went back to school

771
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I told my dad

772
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I couldn't go back

773
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Let me go

774
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
He said

775
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Let's wait

776
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Let's wait

777
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I prayed to God

778
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Wow!

779
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
God, let me go

780
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I couldn't go back

781
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I was in school everyday

782
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Then

783
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Something strange happened

784
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Someone wanted to punish me

785
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Then

786
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I was punished

787
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Someone found the evidence

788
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
He wanted to punish me again

789
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Then he showed it to the principal

790
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
The principal scolded me

791
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
He said

792
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
No evidence

793
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
This is only what they said

794
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
They didn't do it yet

795
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
So

796
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
They shouldn't get anything

797
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You're just thinking too much

798
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
He scolded me

799
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I was surprised

800
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I thought

801
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I couldn't go back

802
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Even my classmates didn't help me

803
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Even the teachers didn't help me

804
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Then

805
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Dad scolded him

806
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
He was fine

807
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
He scolded him

808
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
But nothing happened

809
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The people didn't get punished

810
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I was fine

811
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Then

812
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Dad finally said

813
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Son

814
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I'll help you

815
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I finally went to see

816
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Then

817
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I found a school

818
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
EU Chow International School

819
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I applied

820
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I remember that day

821
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I had an interview

822
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I had to do an exam

823
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I went in

824
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I sat there

825
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I prayed for God

826
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I said

827
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
God

828
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Please protect me

829
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Let me go to school

830
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I really want to go to school

831
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I don't want to be bullied

832
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Beaten

833
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
And so on

834
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Then

835
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
OK

836
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I did it

837
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I didn't hear from them for a month

838
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
No news for two months

839
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Then

840
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
They sent me an email

841
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
They said

842
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I could do a second interview

843
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I could interview the principal

844
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I had two principals

845
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I did the interview

846
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I felt good

847
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But

848
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I didn't hear from them for a while

849
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Then

850
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
One day

851
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It was strange

852
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
The parents

853
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Asked me a question

854
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
They said

855
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
If I was accepted

856
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Would you go to school?

857
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I said

858
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I don't know

859
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
God said

860
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
But I really wanted to go to school

861
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I felt bad

862
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I was bullied

863
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Then

864
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I was accepted

865
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Wow

866
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I cried

867
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I thanked God

868
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I thought

869
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
This is the time

870
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I finally came

871
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I waited for three years

872
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
From year 7

873
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
To year 10

874
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Then I left

875
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Now I feel good

876
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
At least I went to school

877
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I am good with my friends

878
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I don't have to go to school

879
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I don't have to carry anything

880
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
If I leave it for two minutes

881
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I will lose everything

882
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I thank God

883
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I can go to a new school

884
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Thank you

885
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Thank you, Lucas

886
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Lucas, welcome back to our

887
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Titus English Team

888
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So it's very good

889
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Thank you for sharing, Lucas

890
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
We know

891
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You had a difficult experience

892
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Right?

893
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You were bullied at school

894
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
And your teacher didn't help

895
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But we can see that

896
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
He is waiting for God

897
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
He prayed

898
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
He waited for God

899
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Do you want to give me different opportunities?

900
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
New opportunity

901
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
To go to different schools

902
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Let's ask ourselves

903
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
When we wait

904
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Do we pray?

905
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
When we wait for God

906
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Do we have different trials?

907
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Do we read the Bible?

908
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
To wait for God

909
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
To give us direction from His Word

910
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
When we wait for God

911
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Do we ask God to lead us?

912
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
To give us direction

913
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
And when we wait for God

914
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Do we have a supportive community

915
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
To help us?

916
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Right?

917
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Lucas has his parents to support him

918
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Right?

919
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We have different trials

920
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Different times

921
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We have to wait

922
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Do we have a supportive Christian community?

923
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Like the doors are together

924
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
We are constantly in prayer

925
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I remember

926
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I have been in Hong Kong for 3.5 years

927
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I served in Hong Kong

928
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
So fast

929
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I have known you guys for 3.5 years

930
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
But before I came to Hong Kong

931
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I was a trainee in 2016

932
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
In Hong Kong Buddhist Institute

933
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
After I was a trainee

934
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I went back to Canada

935
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
To study in Catholic University

936
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
To finish my seminary

937
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Then the Hong Kong Buddhist Institute invited me

938
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Do you want to come back to serve?

939
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
We are full time

940
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I was thinking in 2017

941
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
The next slide is the picture of Hong Kong

942
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I was thinking

943
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
God, do you really want to bring me back to Hong Kong to serve?

944
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Right?

945
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Back to Hong Kong

946
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
It was very hot in the summer

947
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
My friends were in Canada

948
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
My family and parents were in Toronto

949
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Back to Hong Kong to serve

950
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
There were different trials

951
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Different challenges

952
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I prayed

953
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
God, do you really want to lead me to Hong Kong to serve?

954
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
If yes, may you open doors

955
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Continue to open doors

956
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Right?

957
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Where do you live?

958
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Do you live with your family?

959
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Or do you have different opportunities to live in different places?

960
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
God provided a temporary stay for two months in Tai Kwun

961
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
God provided there

962
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
God provided the opportunity to serve in Hong Kong

963
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Pastor John, the English service, the lead pastor

964
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
He encouraged me to come back

965
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Everything lined up

966
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I asked God to open doors

967
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
He opened all the doors

968
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I looked into scripture

969
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Scripture says in Isaiah

970
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
You will hear a voice saying to you

971
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Look to the left or to the right

972
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
You will hear a voice

973
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Go to this direction

974
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I asked God

975
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
God, lead me

976
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Give me a clear sign

977
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
When I was reading his word

978
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,000
He gave me this passion for people in Hong Kong

979
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And obviously my parents were also very supportive

980
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
我的爸爸媽媽很鼓勵我

981
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
To support me to come back to Hong Kong to serve

982
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And so

983
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
What are you waiting for?

984
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
What are you waiting for?

985
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Today maybe you are healing

986
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
受傷了

987
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Maybe you are physically injured

988
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Maybe you are emotionally injured

989
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And you are waiting for God to heal you

990
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Will you pray?

991
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Will you read scripture?

992
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Will you ask God for his leading?

993
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Maybe today you are like Lucas

994
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And you are going through things at school

995
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And it is very hard

996
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
And you are asking God to help you

997
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
God is there

998
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
He knows your heart

999
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
He knows what you are going through

1000
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Will you pray?

1001
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Will you pray?

1002
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What is prayer?

1003
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Prayer is us humbling ourselves

1004
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
謙卑

1005
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
是不是?

1006
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
神知道我們會pray什麼

1007
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
但我們pray的時候

1008
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
我們的attitude是什麼?

1009
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,000
我們的attitude is humbling ourselves before God

1010
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
As we pray

1011
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
We humble ourselves before an almighty powerful God

1012
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
As we look to scripture

1013
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
What is scripture?

1014
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Scripture is our foundation

1015
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Scripture is our foundation

1016
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
And so when we wait

1017
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
We need foundation

1018
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
A strong foundation

1019
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
第三是什麼?

1020
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
As we wait

1021
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
We need God's leading

1022
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Sometimes we need to wait

1023
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
我們要等候神

1024
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
門徒也要等候

1025
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
聖靈主耶穌帶我們

1026
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
To choose which disciple

1027
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Sam之前也要choose

1028
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,000
神你帶我去哪個university

1029
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Lucas是要等候

1030
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
你是否帶我去這個新的學校

1031
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
這個新的opportunity

1032
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Surrendering ourselves to God

1033
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
第四

1034
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
我們等候神的時候

1035
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
我們需要一個支持的社區

1036
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
一群徒弟

1037
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
父母支持我們

1038
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
親朋好友是信徒

1039
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
他們會幫助我們

1040
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
在等候的時間

1041
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
我們會謙虛地祈禱嗎?

1042
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
我們會看著我們的基礎

1043
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
那就是石矢嗎?

1044
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
我們會看著神

1045
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
和聖靈帶領我們嗎?

1046
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
我們會如何發展社區嗎?

1047
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
我們請我們的慈悲團隊

1048
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
一起祈禱

1049
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
神父

1050
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
我們感謝您

1051
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
對於文書

1052
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
這段話在《聖刀》中

1053
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
我們感謝您

1054
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
讓徒弟們等候

1055
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
祢的聖靈

1056
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
他們祈禱

1057
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
他們遵守

1058
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
他們看著您的文書

1059
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,000
他們等候您的呼喚

1060
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
他們發展社區

1061
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
我祈禱在我們的情況

1062
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
不管我們處於什麼情況

1063
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
無論我們在牢裡

1064
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
還是在牢裡

1065
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
無論我們在等什麼

1066
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
祢會幫助我們

1067
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
做到一樣的事

1068
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
我們在耶穌的名下祈禱
