1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 - Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,800
 My name is Michelle, and I'm really excited tonight because it's the first time that I'm

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,080
 preaching after we've been back and are able to meet together.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,920
 So I'm just very excited.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,200
 And today we're on the topic of a prayer-centered church.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,600
 Yeah, just at the back, could I have a bit of light here?

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,760
 I really can't see my script.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,560
 So the very first scripture that we're reading is actually already read by Bonnie today.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:45,920
 And basically what we see is that the church, the early church devoted themselves to the

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,400
 teachings of the apostles.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,680
 And yes, I know it's not as fast as God making light here, but it's okay.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,080
 Don't worry.

13
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,560
 Whatever we'll make do.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:04,680
 So what we see is that the early Christians, they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,240
 They were in fellowship.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,280
 They were breaking bread and they were praying together.

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,920
 And so when they did that, oh wait, I can actually go without my mask.

18
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,420
 Don't worry, I've done my rad test.

19
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:25,440
 So what happened is that after they've gathered and have prayed, the Lord has added their

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,880
 numbers daily, those who are being saved.

21
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,600
 And so today we really want to look at what it means to be a prayer-centered church.

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,560
 Do you think our church is a prayer-centered church?

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
 Yeah, okay.

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,200
 You're like, "I don't know if we are."

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,320
 But yes, and we want to look further today about what that looks like.

26
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,360
 And sometimes we feel like we can just pray individually at home.

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,960
 We don't necessarily have to pray together in one place at one time.

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,480
 But today we're going to look at what really happens when we do do that, to come together,

29
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,940
 pray at the same time, in the same place, and how the Lord will move in this place.

30
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,360
 So first off, I want to share a Bible passage from the book of, we've already read that,

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,760
 the book of Acts in chapter 12.

32
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,480
 So at that time in this chapter, King Harold had just beheaded James, the brother of John.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,240
 Now because the Jews had delighted it so much that he decided, King Harold, that he's going

34
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,480
 to capture Apostle Peter and put him in prison.

35
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,920
 And so as he did that, the people knew that the next day he would be trialed.

36
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,040
 So the early church, the Christians came together and they said, "We have to pray for Peter."

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,360
 And so they prayed together.

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:59,360
 And Peter, when he was actually bound by chains to two soldiers, all of a sudden he saw an

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,640
 angel of the Lord appeared.

40
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,280
 And the Lord instructed him, "Come, let's go."

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,700
 And even as he was leaving the prison, he thought he was in a vision.

42
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,040
 Even he himself didn't believe it.

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,680
 Until he got out of the prison, that's when he realized, "Oh, this is real.

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,160
 I am out of the prison."

45
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:28,560
 And so he ran straight to the house of Mary where all the Christians had gathered.

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
 And you know what he did?

47
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,520
 He knocked on the door, right?

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,120
 And then a servant girl answered.

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,960
 And this is what happened.

50
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,760
 And we can see it in verse 14 here.

51
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,840
 When she, Ronda, which is the servant girl, recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed

52
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,560
 that she ran back without opening the door.

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
 Okay?

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,760
 So you answer the door, but you don't open it.

55
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,280
 And then she ran back and she exclaimed to everyone, "Peter's at the door."

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,360
 And then everybody says, "You're out of your mind."

57
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,680
 That can't be true.

58
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,020
 But she insists, "No, he's really there."

59
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,120
 So he says, "It might be an angel.

60
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,240
 It might be his angel."

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:20,000
 But when Peter kept on knocking and they finally opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 "It is Peter.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,200
 He is standing right there."

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,040
 So this brings us to our first point, that a prayer-centered church brings unity and

65
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
 faith.

66
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,720
 Now, we saw this in Acts chapter 12, that people saw a need.

67
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,920
 There was an urgent need because Peter might be trialed the next day and he could be beheaded

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,440
 just like James.

69
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,720
 So if he doesn't come out today or tomorrow, he's probably going to be dead.

70
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,280
 And so the church gathered together, not for their own individual needs or desire at that

71
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,920
 time, but they came together for the need of a brother, for someone within the congregation,

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,440
 someone that they loved, and for the kingdom of God.

73
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,320
 So when we pray together, it's actually going to bring us unity to God's heart and what

74
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,440
 he wants us to do.

75
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,920
 And as they prayed together, they were exercising their faith.

76
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,960
 Now I could see from the scripture, they weren't quite sure what God would do.

77
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,000
 Maybe they had a little bit of faith.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,260
 Okay, maybe God will do something.

79
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,740
 Maybe when the sword comes down, it won't chop his head off or something.

80
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,040
 But somehow they were not expecting him to be standing at the door.

81
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,080
 But you see when we pray together, our faith will grow because it no longer is an individual

82
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,840
 experience, but it's a corporate experience.

83
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,800
 Can you imagine if today we were all praying together, I don't know, for someone to show

84
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,320
 up at the door and that person actually showed up, got out of prison and is standing right

85
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
 there.

86
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,400
 Can you imagine our level of faith would grow?

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,040
 I mean, even just hearing it, let's say someone didn't come and they've missed it.

88
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,480
 And even when we have told them, their faith might not be the same as when we had experienced

89
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,320
 it together.

90
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:24,680
 And so as a prayer-centered church, we need to come together to pray, not necessarily

91
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,440
 for ourselves, we can, but more so for the heart of God, to align ourselves there.

92
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,720
 And when we experience him, it will bring us to a new level of faith.

93
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,260
 Now last Friday night, we had a refresh night.

94
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,240
 Now for those of you who have never been to one or don't know what it is, well, it's a

95
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,120
 night where we come together, we worship God and we pray together.

96
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,320
 And I still remember when we were singing in that time, I just felt like I started to

97
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,720
 forget all the busyness of life and I start to forget the things that were on my mind

98
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,000
 or the things that were troubling me.

99
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,320
 And as we were singing, I really felt that we were just looking towards God and trying

100
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,720
 to receive what his heart was.

101
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,040
 And in that evening, we had another time where we actually prayed in groups of two to about

102
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,680
 five people.

103
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,400
 And we prayed for a number of things.

104
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,560
 I mean, it's too small for all of you.

105
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,640
 It's too small for myself as well.

106
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,720
 But there was a list of things that we prayed for.

107
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,960
 We prayed for each other.

108
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,620
 We've prayed for the community.

109
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:42,020
 We prayed for a church to be growing in his words and to be towards his kingdom.

110
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,960
 And we also prayed for the world where we pray for leaders and those who are being oppressed

111
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,440
 or in war.

112
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,360
 And I still remember, as different people were praying, I realized they use words that

113
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,200
 I might not use.

114
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,760
 And they have certain passion that I might not have in that area.

115
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,900
 Or they may have set things in a way that I didn't know that we would pray like that.

116
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:13,600
 And I felt like as I was agreeing with them and saying, "Amen," they were bringing me

117
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,160
 to a kind of prayer that I wouldn't be able to do if I were by myself.

118
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,820
 And the prayer meeting felt very short, even though I think it was close to two hours.

119
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,200
 And I just think that it was a time where we set aside everything.

120
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,120
 We go to God, and that's where his heart is.

121
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,640
 So, and I remember we prayed for the church where our community would grow closer together

122
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,300
 and deeper together.

123
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,800
 And so I felt like the next day, which is a Saturday, that's where we met in service.

124
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,600
 And a whole bunch of us went down for the buffet dinner.

125
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,200
 Okay, who went last Saturday?

126
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,920
 Woo, yeah.

127
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,920
 I mean, we had...

128
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,920
 I mean, if we're gonna cheer, let's really cheer, okay?

129
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
 Woo!

130
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,080
 Okay, so we had 72 people who went for the dinner.

131
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,240
 And we wanted to have more people to go, but we had a wait list.

132
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,920
 I think we end up accommodating everybody.

133
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,960
 But I mean, to my surprise, there were so many people, and not only the number of people,

134
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,040
 but the depth of the conversation.

135
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,840
 Of course, I didn't get to eavesdrop everybody's conversation.

136
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,200
 But just seeing the amount of engagement, yeah, you should be able to find yourself

137
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
 there.

138
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,720
 Just the amount of engagement we had.

139
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,540
 It was like beyond what I had imagined or hoped.

140
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:43,160
 And I felt like because the night before we did pray, and that has played a part for us

141
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,440
 to really come closer together.

142
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,480
 And so I just wanna encourage all of us that as a prayer-centered church...

143
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,840
 Okay, I know, don't start being hungry, okay?

144
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,680
 I know there's a lot of food here.

145
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,560
 Try to come back.

146
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,920
 As we are a prayer-centered church, let us remember that we can pray together for someone

147
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,440
 who's in need, for those that are around us, or for the world.

148
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:20,240
 Now the second thing that I do wanna share is another scripture.

149
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,080
 The second scripture that I want to share with you is from James chapter 5.

150
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,740
 And it says here in verse 13, "Is anyone among you in trouble?

151
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,860
 Let them pray.

152
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,440
 Is anyone happy?

153
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,500
 Let them sing songs of praise.

154
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,480
 Is anyone among you sick?

155
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,280
 Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in

156
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,800
 the name of the Lord.

157
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,480
 And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well.

158
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,440
 The Lord will raise them up.

159
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,320
 If they have sinned, they will be forgiven.

160
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:03,080
 Therefore, confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be

161
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,240
 healed.

162
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,080
 The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective."

163
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:14,580
 Now at first glance at this passage, we might think, "Okay, I think the Bible's asking us

164
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,880
 to reach out to someone and pray for us.

165
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,840
 Maybe the elders, the leaders, because they're more spiritual."

166
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,460
 But actually at a closer glance, this is not what the passage is about.

167
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:33,200
 What the passage is about is for us to become authentic and vulnerable to each other, especially

168
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,880
 through confessing our sins and praying for one another.

169
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,880
 Now how do we know that?

170
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:46,600
 Well, because in verse 13, it tells us that rather you're happy or suffering or you're

171
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:54,000
 sick, find someone, rejoice with them or ask them to pray with you.

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,760
 That's what we need to do as a prayer-centered church.

173
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,320
 But this really is trying to tell us that it's not the people, that particular person

174
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,600
 we don't find, "Oh, Pastor John, Sandra, pray for me because your prayers are more powerful."

175
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:20,600
 It's not like that because the verse says that it's the prayers that are lifted in faith.

176
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,040
 That's what makes it powerful.

177
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,080
 And so as we read, though, we don't quite understand.

178
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,480
 All of a sudden it talks about sins and how when we pray for each other, sin seems to

179
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
 be forgiven.

180
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,680
 I mean, what's that all about?

181
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
 I thought we're just asking to be prayed for.

182
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,200
 Why are there sins involved now?

183
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,760
 Now what we see here is that this passage is really asking us to do a little bit more

184
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,480
 than just asking for prayer.

185
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,560
 It's asking us to confess our sins.

186
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,680
 Now we don't do that very often, do we?

187
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,640
 We don't go to someone and say, "Hey, Nick, I want to confess my sins to you."

188
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
 Why?

189
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,880
 Because we feel like all we need to do when we have sinned against someone, what do we

190
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
 do?

191
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,480
 We feel like we just tell God about it and we might, if we're brave enough, go to the

192
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,800
 person and ask for forgiveness.

193
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:21,720
 But in here, the passage does not say, "Go to the person and ask them for forgiveness."

194
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,960
 There's another passage for that.

195
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,800
 Here it says, "Tell someone the sins that you have committed."

196
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,520
 Now how often do we do that?

197
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,560
 Pretty much not at all, if we do it at all.

198
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
 Why?

199
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,720
 Well, you know, we come to church, what do we want to display?

200
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,840
 The best version of us, right?

201
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,840
 Even if it's not the best version, it's the version that we want to display to other people.

202
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,160
 I don't want to tell you what I did yesterday, like yelling at someone.

203
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,440
 No, you don't want to know that.

204
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
 We just want to give the best version.

205
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,160
 I mean, the best we can do is maybe during our clan or our prayer group, we might say,

206
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,080
 "Oh yeah, work's been really busy.

207
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,880
 Yeah, I've been suffering with ... I've been like, there were too much assignments," or

208
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
 things like that.

209
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,300
 We try to keep it kind of to the surface.

210
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,840
 Now for some of us who are a little bit braver, we're going to share a little bit deeper,

211
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
 okay?

212
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,760
 "Oh, I'm having some struggle in this relationship," or like, "Oh, my coworkers, they're driving

213
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,880
 me crazy," right?

214
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:35,240
 So what we find that we do most of the time though in our prayer group is we're complaining.

215
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,360
 Well, I mean, at least I am.

216
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,960
 Who's guilty of it?

217
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
 Don't put up your hand.

218
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,960
 Okay, okay, put up your hand.

219
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
 Great, great, great.

220
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,440
 I mean, I might be the only one guilty.

221
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
 No, of course not.

222
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
 We're all guilty.

223
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
 What do we do?

224
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,560
 We're like, "Oh, you know that person, you can't believe it.

225
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,000
 You know he did that again.

226
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,960
 Oh, you know my husband didn't listen to me and he doesn't care about me.

227
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,520
 Oh, my wife, you know, she's controlling me again.

228
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,840
 I mean again."

229
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,160
 And then you talk about your boss, right?

230
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,280
 Of course my boss is unfair.

231
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,280
 When is he ever fair, right?

232
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,760
 Oh, right, except my boss.

233
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,600
 Except my boss.

234
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,920
 And so, you know, what we hear is all this grumbling.

235
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,400
 So when we're in small groups, that's all we hear.

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,160
 And then the next thing is, "Pray for me."

237
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,000
 Okay, I'll pray for you.

238
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,640
 And you know, when we say these things, what does it really do to us?

239
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:44,120
 Really, it lifts us up and it puts down the person that we've talked about.

240
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,040
 That's what it does, which is why the Bible does not say, "Come together and let's complain

241
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,240
 and then pray for each other."

242
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,720
 It says, "Confess our sins and pray for each other."

243
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 And what does that mean?

244
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,280
 I mean, can you imagine if we come together and said, "You know what?

245
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,520
 I'm going to call.

246
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
 Pray for me.

247
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,080
 I've been so selfish, you know?

248
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,960
 I've been so selfish.

249
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:19,840
 All I ever think about is how bad my husband has been to me or like how my wife has been

250
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,840
 nagging me."

251
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,640
 Okay, I'm not talking about you.

252
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,320
 I mean, can you imagine if we go to someone, "Pray for me.

253
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
 I've been so selfish.

254
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
 Pray for me.

255
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,480
 I've been so prideful.

256
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,880
 I kept on thinking how much better I am than my co-worker or somebody at school.

257
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,200
 Pray for me because I've not been appreciating my parents.

258
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,560
 I just find them to be annoying.

259
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,360
 Can you pray for me?"

260
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,120
 Or for those people who think maybe there are situations where you have done nothing

261
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,000
 wrong, right?

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,880
 And can you pray for me because I can't forgive this person who has hurt me?

263
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,880
 Can you pray for me?

264
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,040
 I can't love my enemy.

265
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,320
 I always think, you know, what if we prayed like that?

266
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:11,400
 Well, according to the Bible, God's going to heal us.

267
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:20,640
 And according to this passage, the prayer of the righteous one is powerful and effective.

268
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,400
 Maybe the reason that our prayers haven't been that powerful and effective is because

269
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,160
 we haven't done what it says.

270
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,640
 We haven't confessed our sins because most of the time we're on the other side, right?

271
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:40,000
 And so sometimes I imagine, you know, if God looked down and there were two churches, okay?

272
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,520
 There's one that grumbles, complains, and is never satisfied.

273
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,380
 And then there's this other one that just keeps on praying, "Help me, God.

274
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,560
 I want to value others more than myself.

275
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,640
 I want to love those that I find hard to love."

276
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,120
 What will that look like?

277
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:08,240
 I think we'll be healed of our sickness, our situations would turn around, and life would

278
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,000
 never be the same again, and God will open doors.

279
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:24,680
 I want to share with you that as a prayer-centered church, we need to confess our sins to each

280
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:29,280
 other, not necessarily the person that you've sinned against.

281
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,560
 And now that's not to say, you know, come up and get the microphone and start telling

282
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,600
 everybody you've robbed the bank yesterday, right?

283
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
 No.

284
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,840
 But find the trusted people.

285
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
 Tell them.

286
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,480
 Let them pray for you.

287
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,240
 Be transformed in the process.

288
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,240
 Pray for one another.

289
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,200
 And we will see that God will heal us.

290
00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:01,160
 And in 2 Chronicles 7, 14 to 15, it says, "If my people who are called by my name will

291
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:07,680
 humble themselves and pray, and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will

292
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,720
 hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.

293
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:22,800
 Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place."

294
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:32,680
 Can you imagine how much more God will do and would do for us if we did what the Scripture

295
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,920
 said?

296
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,880
 Let us be this prayer sent to church starting today, you know, next time we have Klan, next

297
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,720
 time we have small group, practice it.

298
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,520
 Now I just want to make a note, you know, that's not to say we can't share some of our

299
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,960
 emotions or anguish that we have.

300
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,700
 We can, but don't stay there.

301
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,080
 Go to the next step.

302
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,040
 Yeah, maybe you're very angry at someone and we don't want to suppress it, but after you

303
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:06,160
 express that, you know, go to the next step, confess our sins with each other and pray

304
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,560
 for one another.

305
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:15,560
 Now the third passage that I do want to share before we get here, I know you guys start

306
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,600
 reading once I turn the page.

307
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,520
 So the third passage I want to share with you is from 1 Samuel, chapter 1.

308
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,760
 Now there was a certain man named Okana who has two wives.

309
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,560
 One bears children and the other one does not, and the other one is called Hana.

310
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,880
 And so she was constantly being provoked by the wife that has children.

311
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,040
 And so year after year she would pray, "Oh Lord, you know, give me a child, give me a

312
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
 child."

313
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,200
 But the Lord did not open her womb so she did not have children.

314
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,520
 And so at this time when they were making sacrifices to the Lord, Hana was praying in

315
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,420
 her heart again, just asking God to give her a child.

316
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:08,760
 And so because she was mumbling and crying, then the priest Eli thought that she was drunk.

317
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,360
 And so this is how she replied to him.

318
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,280
 "Not so, my Lord," Hana replied.

319
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,880
 "I am a woman who is deeply troubled.

320
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,680
 I've not been drinking wine or beer.

321
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,520
 I was pouring out my soul to the Lord.

322
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,480
 Do not take your servant for a wicked woman.

323
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,920
 I've been praying here out of my great anguish and grief."

324
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:41,640
 Eli answered, "Go in peace and may the God of Israel grant you what you have asked Him."

325
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,160
 And she said, is it still here?

326
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,320
 Okay.

327
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,720
 And she said, "May your servant find favor in your eyes."

328
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,760
 Then she went her way and ate something and her face was no longer downcast.

329
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,720
 Now in this story, it really tells us that there will be times when we've prayed for

330
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,760
 something for a very long time.

331
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,880
 I mean, long is very subjective.

332
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,520
 Some of us, two days is very long.

333
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,320
 For others, months are very long.

334
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,120
 And for others, years are very long.

335
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,000
 And so we just become sorrowful and even to the point of despair because the Lord is just

336
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,880
 seem like He's not doing anything.

337
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,400
 And I've actually heard people, maybe including myself at some point too, just felt like I

338
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,000
 want to die.

339
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,280
 Why?

340
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,120
 Because I've been waiting for some significant person to appear in my life and it hasn't

341
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,720
 happened yet for the last 20 years, you know?

342
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,260
 And you know, we do get discouraged, right?

343
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:54,500
 Or there's this dream job that I've been trying to go to and just get there, but all the doors

344
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,920
 have been shut like forever, as tight as it can be.

345
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:04,200
 Or someone really wants a child and haven't had the chance to get that yet.

346
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,120
 Or a sickness or something else.

347
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,200
 And we just pray and pray and pray.

348
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,640
 And what do we do?

349
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:20,440
 When we are alone doing that, we get despair to a point where we might not even want to

350
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,280
 live on.

351
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:31,560
 And so our third point is that as a prayer-centered church, we need to encourage one another.

352
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:36,640
 Notice that when Hannah was praying by herself, she was downcast.

353
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:43,600
 But the moment that the priest, Eli, told her, "May the Lord grant you what you have

354
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,280
 asked for," she was again lifted up.

355
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,280
 She was enlightened.

356
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,860
 She's like, "Yes, I remember the Lord."

357
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:58,680
 And so the Lord opened up her womb and she was able to conceive and she had a son called

358
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,360
 Samuel.

359
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,860
 And so what we see here is we should not be doing this on our own.

360
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,040
 We need to be encouraged and we need to encourage one another.

361
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,500
 We need to tell the person, "Keep going.

362
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,000
 Lord loves you and he's going to grant you what you want."

363
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,600
 Now we might say, "What if he never does?"

364
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,000
 That's not the point.

365
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,360
 The point is, do you have faith to go on?

366
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:30,440
 Do you have faith that even if he doesn't, that he will give you whatever it is that

367
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,180
 is best for you?

368
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:38,240
 And so when we pray, I mean, even when Hannah, when she was no longer downcast and she ate

369
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,040
 the food, she doesn't know if she's going to get a baby or not, right?

370
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:50,400
 But because of that encouragement, she was able to press on just to go a little further.

371
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,480
 Sometimes I've seen on Facebook, there's like a little picture.

372
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,200
 Well, there's many pictures, but this particular one that I saw where there were two diamond

373
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,960
 diggers, have you seen that one?

374
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,200
 There was one on top, one at the bottom, and they dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

375
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,600
 And then we see that the diamonds are only inches away for both of them.

376
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,220
 And one person decides to leave and the other one kept on going.

377
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,440
 And sometimes I feel like when we encourage one another, it might just be that another

378
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,840
 inch to go.

379
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:29,720
 And then we will see the Lord delivering us, just like Hannah right here.

380
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:34,840
 So I really pray that, you know, hope that we become a prayer-centered church.

381
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,280
 Let us encourage one another.

382
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:42,800
 And I mean, for some of you who might know that my mother has been fighting lung cancer

383
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,400
 for some time now, it's been three years since the relapse of cancer.

384
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,400
 She's right here.

385
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
 Hello, mommy.

386
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
 I love you.

387
00:25:50,400 --> 00:26:01,120
 And for the last year and a half, her cancer index has started to climb from 2.0 or 2.

388
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,360
 something, 3, 3.

389
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,920
 something, 4, and then it kept going.

390
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,680
 And then two months ago, it was at 16.

391
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,720
 Okay.

392
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,720
 And it was definitely not the direction that we wanted to go at all.

393
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,160
 And honestly, each month I have to tell you when I go with her and the numbers go up,

394
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,800
 you know, I mean, we all pretend it's okay.

395
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,400
 You know, everything's going to be fine.

396
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,200
 But there's all this turmoil that's just going inside.

397
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,460
 We keep on thinking, oh my goodness, like, how's this going to end?

398
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,200
 But we just kept on praying.

399
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
 And you know, I told my clan, like my small group about it.

400
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,440
 And I told many of you that asked about it.

401
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:44,520
 And I was so glad that I didn't have to walk through it alone.

402
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,200
 Because there were so many of you that would come to me and say, "Hey, how's your mom?

403
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,800
 I've been praying for her."

404
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,840
 And you know, for me, that was such great encouragement.

405
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,720
 I bring that back to my mom and I say, "Hey, you know, so and so have been praying for

406
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
 you."

407
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
 And she's like, "Who's that?"

408
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,800
 So I have to explain, oh, you know, that person is that person's that person.

409
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,920
 But never mind.

410
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,120
 What it was, it gave us encouragement.

411
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:17,000
 It felt like, you know, we weren't alone and we were loved by many of you, all of you actually.

412
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,960
 And actually, just to tell you the good news is, last month, we started a new drug for

413
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,000
 her.

414
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,240
 And after using it for one month's time only, her cancer index has dropped from 16 all the

415
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,200
 way to 7 in just one month's time.

416
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,440
 Yes.

417
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,280
 It was like one of the best gifts that God gave us.

418
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,560
 And not only that, did you know that this drug, how much it cost?

419
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,200
 Three, oh, no, I did it wrong.

420
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,240
 $36,000 a month.

421
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,920
 And that's only at the public hospital.

422
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:05,120
 So if you get it at the private, it's $60,000 a month.

423
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
 Okay.

424
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,240
 And because of the prayers, because of the grace of God, because we were connected, because

425
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:19,000
 we told people about it, we were able to source it at the same manufacturer, the same drug,

426
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:29,360
 same effect, because it is the same drug, for $7,000 a month.

427
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,520
 And I just want to let you know that God is here.

428
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:42,640
 And when we pray, maybe it's days, maybe it's weeks has gone by, but keep praying, because

429
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,920
 God will deliver us.

430
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,160
 God will deliver us.

431
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,480
 But don't do it alone.

432
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:54,280
 I don't think it would have been quite the same journey if I were the only one who prayed

433
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,040
 with my mom privately about this.

434
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:04,160
 But I do believe, because all of your prayers and all of your love for us helped us in the

435
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:08,160
 process, and God listened to all our prayers.

436
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,440
 And so I want to encourage you, and I'm actually encouraging myself too, that prayer is not

437
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,920
 something like, "Oh, we do because the Bible tells us to."

438
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,800
 It's something powerful.

439
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,760
 It's meant to heal your sickness.

440
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,720
 It's meant to change the situation that you're in.

441
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,640
 But don't do it alone.

442
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:39,760
 Let us walk together, because there's power, and that's why God gave us this community

443
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,000
 to do it together.

444
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:52,960
 And so now I just wanted to challenge you, challenge myself, to be a prayer-centered

445
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,080
 church.

446
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,800
 And how do we do that?

447
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,360
 Really is to set aside some time, you know, when we have prayer meetings.

448
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,160
 I'm not expecting 10% attendance next time.

449
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,840
 I'm expecting 100% attendance.

450
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:16,680
 Come, set aside that time, pray together, and let us see God's hand and what our faith

451
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,680
 is going to change.

452
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:23,480
 And at the same time, when you're in a small group, practice it each week, you know, going

453
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,200
 to your small group, confessing your sins.

454
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,280
 "Oh my goodness, I was so prideful this week, you know, help me."

455
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,560
 And by confessing it, it's a real humble process, because we're no longer just thinking it in

456
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,280
 my head and still trying to pretend to be someone that got everything together, but

457
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,280
 we're actually being authentic.

458
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,520
 "Yeah, I got issues.

459
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
 I've got problems.

460
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,920
 Can you help me pray?"

461
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,560
 It's a humbling process for us.

462
00:30:52,560 --> 00:31:00,000
 And the third thing really is just to be someone who encourages someone else and be open to

463
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,040
 be encouraged.

464
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,760
 So this is what a prayer-centered church is about.

465
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:13,280
 So now I actually want to invite all of you to turn to one or two people.

466
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,120
 Okay, don't start moving yet, okay?

467
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,840
 I know this is like, you know, when we used to do high school project, right?

468
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,840
 The moment we say get into groups, you're like, "Oh, who am I going to be with?"

469
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,960
 But just hold on.

470
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,000
 Is what we want to do really is just spend a moment, you know, maybe three to five minutes

471
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,500
 where we pray to become this prayer-centered church, okay?

472
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,060
 Pray that we'll set aside time and grow in our faith.

473
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,040
 Pray that we can be bold enough to confess our sins.

474
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,360
 We're humble enough to go to the people that we love and say, "I can't do this.

475
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
 I messed up."

476
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,380
 And then pray that we can encourage and be someone that allows others to encourage us.

477
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,480
 So now we'll have a few minutes and then I'll come back up to do a rapid prayer and our

478
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,360
 worship team will lead us into a response song in just a moment.

479
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,060
 Yeah, so gather in two people or three people.

480
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,180
 And for those of you who are online joining us, if there's someone next to you, please

481
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,240
 pray with them.

482
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,240
 If not, pray in your heart as well.

00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
 Let us pray together.

500
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:14,500
 Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for giving us Jesus.

501
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:19,500
 And we thank you that you've given us the church.

502
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
 It's not a building.

503
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,500
 It's not a place that we go to.

504
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:33,820
 But it's full of your people, the people that loves you, the people that you love, the people

505
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,980
 that are full of your spirit.

506
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:45,700
 And we pray, Father, that as we learn and continue to grow to be this prayer-centered

507
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:51,500
 church, that, Father, your spirit continues to guide us.

508
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,220
 How do we have the right attitude?

509
00:35:54,220 --> 00:36:00,300
 How do we have the right habits so that we are aligned with your heart?

510
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:06,300
 We know that you love the church and that you've prepared him for Jesus and for his

511
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
 return.

512
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,300
 We're meant to be his bride.

513
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:16,140
 And so, Father, we just pray that you'll continue to guide us, to help us, so that we can know

514
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:23,700
 your heart and be the kind of Christians that you have created us to be.

515
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,140
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

516
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,980
 Amen.
