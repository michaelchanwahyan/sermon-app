1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,560
 As Ecclesiastes can appear a rather depressing book at first glance, I wanted to share with

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,600
 you Sandra and I's happy place in Hong Kong.

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,800
 It is, of course, Hong Kong Disneyland.

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,240
 Now everyone says, "Is it because you take the grandkids?"

5
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,240
 But the truth is no.

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,000
 Inevitably it's just the two of us.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,720
 Now being big kids, I've put another picture up there, being big kids in what Disney describe

8
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:57,680
 as a magical place where there are no emails, WhatsApps, or people asking for help and advice.

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,760
 And my favorite is the Lion King.

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,280
 I'll tell you why.

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,160
 30 minutes of air conditioning.

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:19,120
 If you've ever trudged around Disney, especially in the humid Hong Kong summer, you'll know

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,480
 what I mean.

14
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:35,240
 The Lion King story revolves around the Elton John and Tim Rice song, "The Circle of Life."

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,080
 Circles have no beginning and no end.

16
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,760
 If we start anywhere in a circle and we follow it around, we end up in a loop coming back

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,800
 to where we started.

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,800
 It makes me wonder if Simba and Co. got their inspiration from Ecclesiastes.

19
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:05,160
 They certainly would if they'd listened to Pastor Michelle's excellent sermon last week.

20
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:14,800
 Michelle spoke about an English word that few of us ever use in our everyday language,

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,280
 futility.

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:24,240
 And what I loved was her use of the Hebrew word, havel.

23
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,200
 Do you remember she asked us to grasp the air?

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,840
 You remember we all did this?

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:40,560
 Michelle told us that the word havel appears 30 times in Ecclesiastes.

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,600
 Essentially havel means things are insubstantial or fleeting and have no purpose.

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,520
 Futile.

28
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,080
 Lacking substance.

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,000
 Michelle told us that all is vanity.

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,720
 Everything is havel.

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
 Profitless.

32
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
 Purposeless.

33
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 It cannot be grasped.

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
 And it was fleeting.

35
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,720
 Nothing really has a point and you can't hold onto it.

36
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,720
 I remember when I was as a younger man in the corporate world.

37
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 We had these things called KPIs, key performance indicators.

38
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,720
 Some of you will recognise those.

39
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,720
 The business was run on KPIs.

40
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:48,720
 KPIs provided targets for teams to shoot for, milestones to gauge progress,

41
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:57,720
 and insights to help people across the organisation make better decisions.

42
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 When we are tied to a corporation or an organisation, our lives seem to revolve around KPIs.

43
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,720
 And I remember we were paid bonuses.

44
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,720
 Yes, I remember bonuses through a system called MBO, management by objective.

45
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,720
 Achieve your MBO.

46
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,720
 That was your holiday.

47
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,720
 That was your new TV.

48
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:36,720
 Or should I say on the screen, a new pair of Stephen Curry 413 basketball shoes.

49
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:47,720
 But can I say, 20 years on, what difference has achieving or not my MBOs made?

50
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,720
 Is the world a better place?

51
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,720
 Can I actually even remember what my MBOs or my KPIs were?

52
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,720
 And this is what the writer of Ecclesiastes, now whether that was Solomon or not, we discussed that last week,

53
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,720
 it's what the writer of Ecclesiastes was driving at.

54
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,720
 And what we're going to look at tonight in the rest of chapter one,

55
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,720
 is the writer tells us four things.

56
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,720
 He said, nothing seems to change.

57
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,720
 Nothing seems to satisfy.

58
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,720
 Nothing is new under the sun.

59
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,720
 And nothing is understood.

60
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,720
 We're back on futility.

61
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,720
 Havel, what's the point?

62
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,720
 Or is it pointless?

63
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,720
 Let's look at these one at a time.

64
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,720
 Firstly, nothing seems to change.

65
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,720
 And the first piece of evidence is the earth.

66
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:08,720
 From a human point of view, nothing seems more durable than the planet on which we live.

67
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,720
 Generations come and go whilst the earth abides forever.

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,720
 That's a common expression, don't we? As sure as the world.

69
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,720
 I must say, just going off the subject for a moment, I'm heartened by the work of today's generation,

70
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,720
 especially the younger pioneers to save our planet.

71
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:44,720
 But the writer is stressing that whilst nature is fundamentally permanent, notwithstanding what we're doing to it,

72
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,720
 man is transient.

73
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:57,720
 In verse four, we see expressed very clearly the brevity of life.

74
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,720
 And the certainty of death.

75
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,720
 A generation goes, a generation comes.

76
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,720
 But the earth remains forever.

77
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,720
 The 19th century Scottish essayist Thomas Carlyle said this.

78
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:32,720
 History is a mighty drama enacted upon the theatre of time with suns for lamps and eternity for a background.

79
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:45,720
 You see, the costumes and the sets may change, but the actors and the script remain pretty much the same.

80
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,720
 The second piece of evidence is the sun.

81
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,720
 As we move now from the cycle of birth and death.

82
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,720
 To the cycle of day and night in the heavens.

83
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:07,720
 I need to tell you that the sun is constant with its rising and its setting.

84
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:16,720
 The expression as sure as the world is replaced by another one as certain as night follows day.

85
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
 Verse five says this.

86
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
 The sun rises.

87
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,720
 The sun goes down and hastens to the place where it rises.

88
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,720
 I know it's been very hot this week here and especially in Europe.

89
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,720
 I have to say, those pictures I saw of houses burning and things.

90
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:50,720
 And you can tell when the world's turned upside down when there's floods in Sydney and there's bushfires in London, right?

91
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 But as far as the heavens are concerned, one day it's just like another.

92
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 And the heavens remain the same.

93
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
 Our third piece of evidence is the wind.

94
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
 Look at this, verse six.

95
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,720
 The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north.

96
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,720
 Around and around goes the wind and on circuits the wind returns.

97
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
 This is not a physics lesson.

98
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,720
 This is an observation.

99
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,720
 The winds continue their whirling cycle.

100
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:37,720
 Yes, we get typhoons here in Hong Kong and we've seen hurricanes, cyclones and more often than not, the gentle breeze in the trees.

101
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:45,720
 But after all changing direction, it is still the wind.

102
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,720
 Man comes and goes.

103
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:57,720
 Michel used the word vapour. But the changeless wind goes on forever.

104
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 The fourth and last piece of evidence is the sea.

105
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:14,720
 The writer describes the water cycle also as rivers run into the sea, then through evaporation and rain returns to the rivers again.

106
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:27,720
 Scientists tell me that at any time, 97% of all the water in the earth is in the oceans.

107
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:35,720
 And that only 0.0001% is in the atmosphere, available for rain.

108
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,720
 I think we got most of it two weeks ago, didn't we?

109
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,720
 Read this. All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full.

110
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:54,720
 To the place where the streams flow, there they flow again.

111
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:02,720
 The river and rain run into the sea, but the sea never changes.

112
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:18,720
 And so, whether we look to the earth or the heavens, the wind, the waves, we arrive at the conclusion that nature doesn't change.

113
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,720
 No wonder the author seems to agree with the author of The Lion King.

114
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:36,720
 That life is just one big circle. And that frankly, life is not worth living.

115
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
 And they would be right.

116
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,720
 If you leave God out of the picture.

117
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,720
 The world would be predictable, unchangeable, with no answers to prayers, no miracles.

118
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,720
 God imprisoned by the laws of nature.

119
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,720
 But you and I know differently.

120
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,720
 The God we know splits the sea so we can walk right through it.

121
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,720
 And we can sing it, echoing the exodus and the parting of the Red Sea.

122
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:27,720
 We pray for the rain, the wind, the fire of the spirit to fall upon us.

123
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:36,720
 We no longer live in a closed system of endless monotonous cycles.

124
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,720
 We live in this world as pilgrims and not as prisoners.

125
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:49,720
 But this writer, oh my goodness, he's not going to let up.

126
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,720
 His next argument is this, oh, nothing seems to satisfy.

127
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,720
 He says all things are full of weariness.

128
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,720
 A man cannot utter it.

129
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:09,720
 The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

130
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,720
 When I was young, I remember the Rolling Stones, it's probably only me and you, Joseph.

131
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,720
 The Rolling Stones singing, I can't get no satisfaction. Do you remember that?

132
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,720
 I can't get no satisfaction.

133
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,720
 Human nature is always clamouring for more.

134
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,720
 Despite all our labours, man is never truly satisfied.

135
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,720
 And the entertainment industry, they see this hunger and they take advantage.

136
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,720
 And they make billions as a result.

137
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,720
 I want to tell you something.

138
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,720
 The eye cannot be satisfied until it sees the hand of God.

139
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:08,720
 The ear cannot be satisfied until it hears the voice of God.

140
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:16,720
 Let us submit to him and only then will we be satisfied.

141
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,720
 I love this verse from Isaiah 58 verse 11.

142
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:31,720
 And the Lord will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scorched places and make your bones strong.

143
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:43,720
 You shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.

144
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:50,720
 But the writer of Ecclesiastes, he's persistent, he still doesn't give up.

145
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,720
 He says, there's nothing new under the sun.

146
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
 Let's read it.

147
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,720
 What has been is what will be.

148
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,720
 And what has been done is what will be done.

149
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,720
 There is nothing new under the sun.

150
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,720
 Is there a thing of which it said, see, this is new?

151
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,720
 It's already been in the ages before us.

152
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:28,720
 There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after.

153
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
 I've put a quote on the screen.

154
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,720
 Robert Schindler, a Baptist pastor and a close associate of Charles Spurgeon, wrote this.

155
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,720
 If it's new, it's not true.

156
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,720
 If it's true, it's not new.

157
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,720
 We need to remember that man is the creature.

158
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 It is God alone who is the creator.

159
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,720
 The problem is we have bad memories.

160
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,720
 We don't read the minutes of the previous meeting.

161
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:19,720
 Verse 11 simply says, we simply don't remember the past, nor will the future remember the present.

162
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:33,720
 The Christian follows a God who says, behold, I am doing a new thing.

163
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,720
 That is, writer now suddenly changes his hats.

164
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,720
 He suddenly changes hats from historian to philosopher.

165
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,720
 He's putting on his preacher hat.

166
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,720
 Michel told us that the Hebrew word was kohelef.

167
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:09,720
 And then talks about his own search for wisdom before coming to the conclusion that all human wisdom is futile.

168
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
 And his fourth point was this.

169
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
 He said, nothing's understood.

170
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,720
 I want to read this in one chunk for you before picking it apart.

171
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,720
 I, the preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.

172
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,720
 And I applied my heart to seek and search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven.

173
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,720
 It's an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.

174
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,720
 I've seen everything that's done under the sun.

175
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,720
 And behold, all is vanity and is striving under the wind.

176
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,720
 What is crooked cannot be made straight.

177
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
 What is lacking cannot be counted.

178
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:54,720
 He said, in my heart, I've acquired great wisdom, surpassing all that were over Jerusalem before me.

179
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,720
 And my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.

180
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,720
 And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly.

181
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,720
 I perceive that this also is but a striving after the wind.

182
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,720
 For in much wisdom is much vexation.

183
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,720
 And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.

184
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,720
 What I want to do, I want to look at this in three parts.

185
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,720
 Number one, the first part is the preacher describes his search.

186
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,720
 He reminds us he was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

187
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:41,720
 He determined, he said, I applied my heart to use wisdom and search all that has been done under heaven.

188
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,720
 A task that he understood God had given all men to challenge them.

189
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 I want you to look at this statement.

190
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,720
 A statement about life itself in verse 13.

191
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,720
 It is unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.

192
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,720
 Now that's the ESV.

193
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,720
 The message puts it like this.

194
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,720
 Now let me tell you, there's not much to write home about.

195
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,720
 God hasn't made it easy for us.

196
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,720
 You don't need me to tell you that life is tough.

197
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:35,720
 Other Bible versions talk about life as a grievous task, a miserable fate, a terrible burden.

198
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:46,720
 But what verse 13 tells us that while life is tough, it is a gift from God.

199
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,720
 I was sitting at home the other night having a, I had a woe is me day.

200
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,720
 It seemed like everything that could go wrong, so went wrong.

201
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:05,720
 And I was sitting at home, like feeling sorry for myself when I heard a bird singing outside.

202
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,720
 It was if the bird was saying to me, yeah, it's been quite a day.

203
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,720
 I've been avoiding predators all day and having to scrap for bits of food for me and my little ones.

204
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,720
 I've done nothing but fight to survive.

205
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:28,720
 But at the end of the day, I've still got the breath and the will to sing.

206
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,720
 I was immediately reminded of Phil Wickham's song, Sing.

207
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,720
 He says this, "For the cross that you bore and the debt that you paid,

208
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,720
 for the victory you won over death and the grave, this is the reason I sing.

209
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,720
 For the hope that you give and the joy that you bring, for the promise that heaven is waiting for me.

210
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,720
 This is the reason I sing."

211
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,720
 Life is indeed a gift from God.

212
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,720
 And it doesn't get any easier if you try and run away from it.

213
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,720
 Look at verse 14, "I have seen everything that is done under the sun,

214
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,720
 and behold all is vanity and is striving after the wind."

215
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,720
 The writer, the preacher is saying that all works done under the sun

216
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,720
 never truly satisfy the heart.

217
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,720
 And we start looking for things that will fill the gap.

218
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,720
 Both the workaholic, we've got a few in Hong Kong, right?

219
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:39,720
 The workaholic and the alcoholic are running away from reality.

220
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,720
 But we only make life harder by trying to escape.

221
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:56,720
 Instead of running away from God, we should run to God and let him make a life worth living.

222
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,720
 Referencing our emotional health series here at KFCI,

223
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,720
 I am more than deeply saddened by the prevalence of suicides and attempted suicides,

224
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,720
 particularly of our younger people here in Hong Kong and elsewhere.

225
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:21,720
 My friends, we must never stop reaching out to people around us.

226
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,720
 But for those of us that are making a choice to live,

227
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:34,720
 we also need to make a choice how to live.

228
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,720
 Back to Ecclesiastes 1, we find a proverb, a popular saying in verse 15,

229
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:48,720
 "What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted."

230
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
 I'll put it in English.

231
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,720
 The past cannot always be changed,

232
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,720
 and it is pointless to fret on what you might have done.

233
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
 I always say, those of you who know me well,

234
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:16,720
 those two useless words in the English language are "should have."

235
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,720
 What we have done wrong cannot normally be righted,

236
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:31,720
 except that we must remember that God has the power to straighten what is twisted and supply what is lacking.

237
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,720
 I know. Why?

238
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:46,720
 He took this twisted individual, me, and took all my past mistakes and failures.

239
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:55,720
 He nailed them to a cross, and he set me free.

240
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:04,720
 For a child of God, the past, even with our sins and mistakes, is a rudder that guides us forward.

241
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,720
 I'm going to say that again.

242
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:15,720
 For a child of God, the past, even with our sins and mistakes, is a rudder that guides us forward.

243
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,720
 Let's look to wrap this up as we return to the preacher.

244
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,720
 We look at the preacher applying his God-given wisdom.

245
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:36,720
 He acknowledged the greatness and the wisdom he'd attained.

246
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,720
 He had PhDs coming out of his ears, right? He had so much of it.

247
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,720
 He therefore sought to apply it to understand wisdom, madness, and folly.

248
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,720
 Let's read what he said.

249
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:56,720
 I said in my heart, I've acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me.

250
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,720
 And my heart has great experience of wisdom and knowledge.

251
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,720
 And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly.

252
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:16,720
 I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind.

253
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:24,720
 Quite often, wisdom, wisdom and knowledge, wisdom and experience will not solve every problem.

254
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,720
 For a start, there are no explanations for some things that happen.

255
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,720
 I have no explanation for what's happened to Brian and Marissa this week.

256
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,720
 I'll be honest with you.

257
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:50,720
 But perhaps more importantly, God wants his people to live on promises and not on explanations.

258
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,720
 Can I say that again?

259
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:59,720
 God wants his people to live on promises and not explanations.

260
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,720
 To live by sight and not, sorry, to live by faith and not by sight.

261
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,720
 Sorry, Alison, you put me off there.

262
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,720
 I thought I'd said something to upset you and you were running out.

263
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,720
 To live by faith and not by sight.

264
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,720
 The preacher's great wisdom only added to his difficulties.

265
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:31,720
 For so often, wisdom and knowledge can simply add to sorrow and grief.

266
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,720
 The more we seek wisdom and knowledge, the more it becomes obvious just how ignorant we are.

267
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,720
 I find the more I learn, the less I know.

268
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,720
 The more I learn, I find myself more saying it depends.

269
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:53,720
 Maybe, possibly, or the infamous I don't know.

270
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:58,720
 T.S. Eliot who wrote Cats once wrote this.

271
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,720
 All of our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance.

272
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,720
 I think he got his inspiration from Ecclesiastes 1 which concludes like this.

273
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,720
 The preacher concluding that human wisdom is futile.

274
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
 He says this.

275
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,720
 I perceive that this is also but a striving after the wind.

276
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,720
 For in much wisdom is much vexation.

277
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,720
 And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.

278
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,720
 The old proverb states a wise man is never happy.

279
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:41,720
 But it doesn't have to be like that.

280
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,720
 And this is the most important line I'm going to speak this evening.

281
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
 So listen to this.

282
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:55,720
 For the Christian life is an open door and not a closed circle.

283
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,720
 Can I say that again?

284
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:09,720
 The Christian life is an open door and not a closed circle.

285
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:19,720
 I and others can testify that they experience daily new blessings from the Lord.

286
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,720
 I can't explain everything.

287
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,720
 But my life is not built on explanations.

288
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,720
 It's built on promises.

289
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,720
 I read that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 promises in the Bible.

290
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,720
 That puts us in a privileged position.

291
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
 I mean, look at the scientist.

292
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,720
 He or she wants to tell you that the world is a closed system and that nothing has changed.

293
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,720
 Look at the historian who tells us life is a closed box and nothing is new.

294
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:08,720
 Look at the philosopher who tells us that life is a deep problem and that nothing is understood.

295
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:16,720
 But Jesus Christ, whom Paul describes as the power of God and the wisdom of God,

296
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:25,720
 has miraculously broken into history to bring new life to all who trust him.

297
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:38,720
 My friend, if you are living in circles, it's time to change your tune.

298
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:47,720
 It's time to change your tune, maybe from the circle of life to perhaps a Kuna Matata.

299
00:29:47,720 --> 00:30:02,720
 But better still, to turn your eyes upon Jesus and to put your trust in him.

300
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:09,720
 If you stand and go ask the band or at least Paul the band to come up and lead us in this song.

301
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,720
 We're going to sing this song together, "Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus."

302
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,720
 We sang a few new songs tonight.

303
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,720
 This is one that's an old song. You'll know this.

304
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,720
 I remember singing it at Sunday school, it shows how old it is.

305
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,720
 Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in his wonderful face,

306
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,720
 and the things of life will go strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace.

307
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,720
 And at the end of it, Johnny will come up and pray for us.

308
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:46,720
