1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
 Good morning, how's everybody doing?

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,680
 We are starting a new sermon series

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,040
 and it is on true joy.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,800
 What is true joy?

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,440
 The Book of Philippians.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

9
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,360
 The Book of Philippians.

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,280
 Joy.

12
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,760
 How many times did Paul talk about joy

14
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,840
 in the Book of Philippians?

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,320
 How many times?

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,680
 Huh, see?

18
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

19
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,160
 1,000, wow!

20
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,080
 I don't know if there's 1,000 words in the whole book.

21
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

22
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,440
 66, (speaking in foreign language)

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,280
 (woman speaking in foreign language)

24
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,600
 16 times Paul talks about joy.

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,480
 Why does he mention joy?

28
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,240
 Because he's very joyful, obviously.

29
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

30
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,800
 Let's go to the next slide.

31
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,680
 Different aspects of joy.

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,960
 The joy of community, having joy in difficult times.

33
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,080
 Who wants joy in difficult times?

34
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,360
 Having the mentality of joy, the joy of obedience,

36
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,760
 the goal of joy, and the practice of joy.

37
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:42,880
 Okay, very good.

41
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,120
 Let's take a minute just to prepare our heart

43
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,000
 and really focus on the Lord today.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,880
 Give the Lord our best today.

45
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,000
 Let's take a moment to pray for ourselves.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
 Prepare our heart.

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,680
 Dear Lord, as we go into your word today,

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,360
 may you bless us and may you lead us by your Holy Spirit.

49
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,120
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

50
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:31,240
 Dear, dear sir, Mr. Lai.

52
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Sam, say it.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,520
 (laughing)

55
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,280
 Elias.

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

58
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,320
 Okay.

59
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,200
 Okay, next slide.

61
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

62
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,960
 Any email?

63
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

64
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,480
 60AD, (speaking in foreign language)

65
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:28,600
 Message in a--

66
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

67
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,280
 Oh, card.

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,880
 Oh, I'm looking forward to your card.

69
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,640
 (laughing)

70
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,480
 Very good, man.

71
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,160
 Okay, very good.

72
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

73
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,920
 No Snapchat?

74
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,160
 Oh, here, I'm Paul, I'm in Rome.

75
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,000
 (laughing)

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,080
 Let me take next slide.

78
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,160
 Dear Church of Philippi.

79
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,640
 Okay, (speaking in foreign language)

80
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,520
 The Church of Philippi, the leaders and deacons.

81
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

82
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,360
 Oh, I hope you're doing well.

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

84
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,400
 May God's grace and peace with you.

85
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

86
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

87
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,640
 Without God's grace.

88
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,480
 We need grace, God's grace in our life.

89
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,480
 God's grace is having his love that we don't deserve,

90
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,880
 his presence, his blessings that we don't deserve,

91
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,360
 and then we can experience his peace.

92
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

93
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,760
 I am servants of God.

94
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,360
 I am servants of God.

95
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

96
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
 Not end the letter, end the email.

97
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

98
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,840
 Introduce the email.

99
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,240
 Okay, (speaking in foreign language)

100
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

101
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,920
 Where is Philippi?

102
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

103
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,200
 Modern day Philippi (speaking in foreign language)

104
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

105
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,920
 It is in Greece.

106
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,880
 Let's look at the next slide.

107
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,960
 It is in modern day Greece.

108
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

109
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,480
 Yeah, good.

110
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

111
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,480
 Athens, Athens is nice.

112
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
 It can be very hot though in the summer.

113
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,520
 Modern day Greece.

114
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

115
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:23,160
 He was like, oh, I wanna go to modern day Turkey,

116
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,280
 share the gospel.

117
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

118
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,560
 Modern day Turkey.

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

120
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,080
 Turkey is beautiful, you should go to Turkey.

121
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:56,400
 Anybody remember their dream?

123
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

124
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,160
 He had a vision of a man from Macedonia,

125
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,120
 which is from Greek, okay?

126
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

127
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:15,800
 And so he went to Macedonia to modern day Philippi.

128
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

129
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,080
 I had a dream.

130
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,280
 I had a dream that I was selling some of my shoes

131
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,400
 and I had a nightmare.

132
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,240
 (laughing)

133
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

134
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,200
 I want my shoe back, I don't care about the money.

135
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,440
 (laughing)

136
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

137
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:45,800
 Like the thunder, he followed the thunder

138
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,680
 to go to Macedonia, to Philippi.

139
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

140
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,000
 Gold mines, anybody invest in gold?

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,200
 Yeah, invest in gold.

142
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

143
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,880
 I'm joking.

144
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,720
 (laughing)

145
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
 You should invest in gold.

146
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,120
 When, okay, you invest in gold.

147
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,040
 It was known for its gold mines.

148
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,000
 Also, it was known for the battle of Philippi.

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

150
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,480
 So Caesar, do you know Caesar was assassinated?

151
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,320
 By who?

152
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

153
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,080
 It was his own cabinet, his own Senate, okay?

154
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,160
 And then they escaped to Philippi

155
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,040
 and then I think it was Octavian and Mark Anthony

156
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

157
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,960
 who defeat them and that was in the battle of Philippi

158
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,680
 and so that is what Philippi was known for.

159
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,640
 It was also known for the birthplace of Christianity.

160
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

161
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,840
 And then it was also a popular place

162
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,080
 for people to stay for the trade route.

163
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

164
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,800
 The Silk Road towards Rome, okay?

165
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,080
 So imagine, you would stay here to bring the goods to Rome

166
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,520
 and then it was known for a Roman colony.

167
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,160
 It was a Roman colony.

168
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

169
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,760
 People in Philippian church.

170
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

171
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,120
 Nathan.

172
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

173
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

174
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

175
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

176
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,560
 Okay, the first thing that Paul says

177
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,640
 is that he is thanking God for them.

178
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

179
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,720
 It's filled with joy.

180
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,240
 His prayer is filled with joy.

181
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

182
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,840
 He's in Rome.

183
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

184
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:43,880
 On the same chains.

185
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,520
 You know who he's chained with?

186
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,640
 He's chained with a Roman guard.

187
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

188
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,120
 A Roman guard.

189
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

190
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:12,000
 He's awaiting his trial and possible execution.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

192
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

193
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,600
 No, it's in a dark, next slide.

194
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,000
 It's in a dark, rocky pit.

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,160
 Next slide, next slide.

196
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,960
 Yes, like this, dark, rocky pit.

197
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

198
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,720
 There's probably mold growing in it, right?

199
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,080
 Like your room.

200
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,920
 And.

201
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,720
 (laughing)

202
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

203
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,240
 Chained to a Roman guard.

204
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,680
 Why is he joyful?

205
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,760
 Because of the partnership of this church in Philippi.

206
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,280
 Of this church in Philippi.

207
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,760
 And he says that they have been partnering with him

208
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,120
 from the first day of the gospel.

209
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,600
 Let's look at the next slide.

210
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,200
 The joy of community.

211
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,000
 The joy of community.

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,360
 The one before, the one before.

213
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,360
 The joy of community.

214
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,400
 The one with the girl.

215
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,000
 The joy of community.

216
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

217
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:40,920
 The seller of purple cloth.

218
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

219
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,520
 Yes, the rulers or the kings.

220
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

221
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,480
 'Cause it is the symbol of wealth and prosperity.

222
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

223
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,000
 (laughing)

224
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

225
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:48,760
 Imagine.

226
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

227
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,440
 Victoria Harper, TST.

228
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,960
 Meet the owner or the head of LV or something.

229
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,760
 Gucci, Cartier, I don't know.

230
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

231
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,520
 That is what it was like.

232
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

233
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
 The seller of purple cloth.

234
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,200
 From that first day, she and her family

235
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,360
 partnered with him to help start the church.

236
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

237
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:40,560
 It's like the sound of thunder.

238
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

239
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,240
 There were two jail prison guard.

240
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

241
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,080
 The prisoners will leave.

242
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,000
 And then the jailer wanted to kill himself

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,680
 because he would face the death punishment

244
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,760
 if anything happened and the prisoners left.

245
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,640
 So he was ready to kill himself.

246
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

247
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,520
 Him and his household believed in Jesus

248
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,520
 and they joined the church together.

249
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

250
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:34,120
 It was very hard, very difficult.

251
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

252
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,880
 Very difficult.

253
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,960
 Same situation, same same.

254
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,200
 (laughing)

255
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

256
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:56,320
 Jailer, Lydia partnered with them in the gospel.

257
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

258
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,880
 It says in 2 Corinthians,

259
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,920
 when I was present with you and in need,

260
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,280
 I was a burden to no one for what I lacked,

261
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,160
 the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied.

262
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

263
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,280
 And it says in the next verse, 2 Corinthians 8,

264
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,200
 for I bear witness that according to their ability,

265
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,120
 yes, beyond their ability,

266
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,520
 they were willing to freely give,

267
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,240
 imploring us with much urgency

268
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,680
 that we would receive the gift and fellowship

269
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,960
 of ministering to the saints.

270
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,960
 The church in Philippi sent money to Paul and Timothy

271
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,720
 to support his ministry.

272
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

273
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:04,960
 Congratulations.

274
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,320
 Wow, very good partnership.

275
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,840
 And my support, encouragement.

276
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

277
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,360
 Encouragement from the church of Philippi.

278
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,200
 Philippi.

279
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

280
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,000
 What is joy?

281
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

282
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:32,560
 Joy comes from the fruit of the spirit.

283
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,240
 Right, the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace,

284
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,520
 patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness,

285
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,360
 and self-control.

286
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

287
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,080
 It is a gift and a fruit of the Holy Spirit.

288
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

289
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,400
 Joy is despite our circumstances.

290
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

291
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,800
 Filled with joy because we trust

292
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,200
 that God has the best plan.

293
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,240
 And our focus, because we have joy, is not on us.

294
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,640
 It is on God.

295
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,560
 God is the one that will provide.

296
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,880
 God will get us, lead us according to his will.

297
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,280
 Whether I'm in jail or I'm sharing the gospel elsewhere,

298
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,680
 I am joyful.

299
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

300
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,120
 Before Caesar, it doesn't matter.

301
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

302
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,800
 Stone Stephen to death.

303
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:13,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:24,600
 No, he was full of anger.

305
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,680
 He was full of anger.

306
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

307
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,680
 He thought he was doing something for God.

308
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,120
 He wasn't full of joy.

309
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,560
 Now he's full of joy.

310
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,400
 Why?

311
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,960
 Because God changed him.

312
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,120
 Jesus changed him.

313
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,080
 On the road of Damascus,

314
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,160
 Jesus said, "Why are you persecuting me?

315
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,360
 "Why are you persecuting me?"

316
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

317
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,760
 From Saul to Paul, joy is having a state of security,

318
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,320
 being secure, a state of being.

319
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,240
 I'm joyful because I believe God has called me

320
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
 to be his son and his daughter.

321
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,320
 I am saved.

322
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,680
 I am joyful.

323
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

324
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:24,000
 But it's temporary.

325
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

326
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,280
 That is happiness.

327
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,000
 But joy is knowing who we are in Jesus Christ.

328
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And lastly, joy comes from a place of gratitude and prayer.

329
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

330
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,200
 I am praying for you.

331
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,240
 I'm so thankful for you.

332
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,880
 So that is joy versus happiness.

333
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

334
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,120
 He's gonna share some of his own story.

335
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,440
 (audience applauding)

336
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,400
 Okay.

337
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

338
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,320
 Ready, okay, all right.

339
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

340
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

341
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,840
 Final year.

342
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,760

343

357
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,400
 Achievement.

 (audience applauding)

423
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
 Wow, great sharing.

424
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 Great sharing.

425
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

426
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:45,960
 Do you think you are more happy or joyful?

427
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,840
 Do you think you are more happy or joyful?

428
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

429
00:26:51,760 --> 00:27:01,200
 More happiness in their life, happiness.

430
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

431
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,800
 Who thinks they experience more joy in their life?

432
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,640
 More joy, okay.

433
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,480
 Okay.

434
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

435
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,560
 Who thinks they experience more happiness in their life?

436
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,240
 It's okay, no judgment, no judgment.

437
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,080
 Okay.

438
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

439
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,520
 Okay, we're gonna learn two more things.

440
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,400
 The first thing that we learned is the joy of partnership.

441
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,240
 Okay, the joy of partnership in the gospel.

442
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

443
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,120
 When I was in University of Toronto,

444
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,640
 I joined a Christian group,

445
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,800
 and we held events to help people know Jesus.

446
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,360
 We held a does God exist debate,

447
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
 and there was like 1,000 people,

448
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,320
 1,000 university students to join this debate,

449
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,520
 and it was so happy 'cause we saw students

450
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,800
 come to know Jesus through these events.

451
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,520
 We were working together.

452
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,360
 There was partnership.

453
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

454
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,880
 Confidence in the faithful work of God.

455
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,680
 And the third thing is praying

456
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,400
 for the spiritual growth of others.

457
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,240
 Okay.

458
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

459
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,760
 Confidence in the faithful work of God.

460
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,320
 Paul says here, and I am sure of this,

461
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,640
 that he who began a good work in you

462
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,640
 will bring it into completion at the day of Jesus Christ.

463
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

464
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,640
 Yes, so that God will continue to work

465
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,200
 in the lives of the people in the church of Philippi.

466
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,200
 From them, even though he may die,

467
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,160
 God will continue to do its work,

468
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,240
 and that is his joy, right?

469
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,320
 'Cause Paul says, I have fought the good fight.

470
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,120
 I've finished the race, and I have kept the faith.

471
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:56,120
 His joy is that he has done the best he can

472
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,680
 to help these people to know Jesus.

473
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,120
 There's this word called discipleship.

474
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

475
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,800
 Discipleship.

476
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,160
 And it says here that the things you've heard me say

477
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,080
 in the presence of many witnesses,

478
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,000
 entrust them to people who are qualified

479
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,920
 to also teach others.

480
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

481
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,680
 Timothy.

482
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:23,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

483
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,840
 Disciple who?

484
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,240
 Faithful men and women who can also do what?

485
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,960
 Disciple others who are also reliable people.

486
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,200
 So why is Paul filled with joy?

487
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,800
 Because he has started the discipleship process.

488
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,760
 He's built into people in the church of Philippi

489
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:44,280
 like the jailer, like Lydia, and he's built into Timothy,

490
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,560
 and he believes that even though he may die,

491
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,120
 God will continue the work of discipleship

492
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,640
 in the church of Philippi and towards the ends of the earth.

493
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,480
 What he started in Timothy,

494
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,920
 he will carry it into faithful people

495
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,720
 who will also carry it into others.

496
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

497
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:12,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

498
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,240
 I was a student intern.

499
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,400
 No, no, no, not 1916.

500
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

501
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:35,760
 Okay, I was here since 2016, all right?

502
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,080
 2017, all right?

503
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,440
 Who was here in 2016?

504
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

505
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,120
 Who was here?

506
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,280
 Vian was here, yeah, all right?

507
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,840
 It's been a joy to see you grow

508
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,960
 in your relationship with God.

509
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,680
 Next slide, we went to Cambodia together, okay?

510
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

511
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,400
 Before all the kidnapping, right?

512
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,720
 (laughing)

513
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,120
 Before all the kidnappings,

514
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,560
 the parents wouldn't let us go now.

515
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,080
 Before all the kidnappings, we went to Cambodia.

516
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,160
 We were sharing in the schools.

517
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,520
 Sorry, I'm gonna speak English 'cause I can speak faster.

518
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,160
 We have to end soon.

519
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,080
 And we were sharing the gospel,

520
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,440
 and Vian was leading them in singing songs,

521
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,000
 and also Nathan was leading them

522
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,400
 in terms of the Bible story, right?

523
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,840
 It was a joy to see them grow.

524
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,360
 Before, they were very shy,

525
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,480
 and they were like, "Oh, I don't know what to do.

526
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,720
 "I'm in a foreign nation," right?

527
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,640
 But they stepped up.

528
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,640
 It was the joy of seeing people grow and serve God.

529
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,720
 And then, you know, one month ago, where were we at?

530
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

531
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,240
 We were in camp, or July in camp, right?

532
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,360
 And it was a joy to see you guys counseling.

533
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,760
 The older guys were helping mentor the younger ones.

534
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,880
 It was a joy.

535
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

536
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,080
 Next year, you gotta come.

537
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,240
 The joy of seeing you guys as college people

538
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,800
 start to mentor others, and that is the joy.

539
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,840
 The same joy Paul had,

540
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,360
 that he saw those who he was discipling

541
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,440
 start to mentor others.

542
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,880
 How can we have joy in Explorer?

543
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,800
 That we start to build into others.

544
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,960
 The pastors and mentors will build into the student leaders,

545
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,240
 and the student leaders build into the older ones,

546
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,120
 and the older ones build into the younger ones.

547
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,360
 That is the joy of community,

548
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,760
 and that's what we want to see.

549
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,160
 The last thing that Paul had joy in

550
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:45,160
 was the joy of praying for the spiritual growth of others.

551
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:50,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

552
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,760
 Are you praying for them?

553
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,800
 And that is what Paul is praying for.

554
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,160
 And this is my prayer,

555
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,840
 that your love may abound more and more

556
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,240
 with knowledge and discernment,

557
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,320
 so that you may approve what is excellent,

558
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,880
 to be pure and blameless for the day of Christ.

559
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,520
 Pure and blameless.

560
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,440
 Paul's prayer is that these Philippians

561
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,680
 would have love that abounds.

562
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

563
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,000
 Overflowing, abound, overflowing.

564
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

565
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,960
 That is what Paul wants of them,

566
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,200
 to have love that abounds, overflowing.

567
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

568
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,400
 That's what Paul wants, that we pray for each other,

569
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,920
 that our love may abound.

570
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,480
 If we love one another,

571
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,600
 we're gonna have joy automatically, automatically.

572
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,600
 Imagine everybody's love is abounding, overflowing.

573
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,480
 How could this explore community not be joyful?

574
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,280
 The next quote says this,

575
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,040
 "Every great movement of God

576
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,160
 "can be traced to a kneeling figure."

577
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,200
 Every great movement can be traced to a kneeling figure.

578
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:20,560
 As we pray for explorer, pray for the people beside us,

579
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,360
 we will start to see a movement,

580
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,280
 a movement of joy in our community.

581
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,640
 Let's pray together for each other.

582
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,240
 So three things.

583
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

584
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,880
 Partnership in the gospel, serving one another.

585
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,160
 Paul and Timothy are bond servants, servants of Jesus Christ.

586
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,000
 We will have joy when we serve together

587
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,380
 and partner together.

588
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,200
 Number two, we will have joy when we have confidence

589
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,360
 that God will continue to build into one another.

590
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,760
 Discipleship, we will have joy

591
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,160
 when we build into one another.

592
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,080
 Number three, we will have joy when we pray for each other,

593
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,780
 that God's love would abound more and more.

594
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:09,200
 Are we an explorer praying for one another,

595
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,080
 that God's love would abound?

596
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,720
 An explorer, are we discipling,

597
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,240
 building into one another?

598
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,720
 We want to disciple you to know Jesus,

599
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,000
 to grow in your love for Jesus

600
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,440
 so that you can also build into others.

601
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,640
 That's what we wanna do here in explorer.

602
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,200
 Are you willing to be stipled?

603
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,820
 And number three, are you willing to serve one another?

604
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:39,760
 Coming to explore is not just,

605
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,520
 oh, I receive, I receive, I receive.

606
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,480
 It is us giving to one another, giving to the Lord.

607
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,840
 That is how we're gonna build a joyful community.

608
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,920
 It's not just sitting here, playing on your phone

609
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,520
 and hoping somebody does something for you.

610
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,240
 We are not your, well, we are here to serve you, yes,

611
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,440
 but we are here to serve one another as Jesus' example,

612
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,080
 to wash one another's feet.

613
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

614
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,080
 No, I'm joking.

615
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,400
 Okay, and so that is our prayer.

616
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,280
 We want to have a joyful community

617
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,240
 in this new season of explorer.

618
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,800
 Let's build one another up.

619
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,280
 Let's pray for one another.

620
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,280
 Let's serve one another so that God will be glorified.

621
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,840
 Let's take a moment to pray.

622
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,480
 Pray for our explorer community.

623
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,480
 And I'm gonna ask Winnie and Rita to come up.

624
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,120
 Let's take a moment to pray.

625
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:55,320
 Let's pray for our community in explorer

626
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,320
 that God would give us joy as we serve together,

627
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,760
 as we pray for one another,

628
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,880
 as we build each other up in community.

629
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,920
 Let's pray to God.

630
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,720
 Let's take one minute to pray,

631
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,720
 and then we will enter into a time of communion.

632
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,400
 Lord, we pray for our community, explorer.

633
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,060
 We want it to be filled with the joy of Jesus Christ.

634
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:25,280
 We thank you for the passage from Philippians today.

635
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,480
 Help us, Lord, to serve one another.

636
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,200
 Help us to pray for one another.

637
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,200
 And help us, Lord, to build each other up in Jesus Christ.

638
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,920
 May you help us, Lord.

639
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,880
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

640
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:50,880
