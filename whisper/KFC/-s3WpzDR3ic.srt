1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,760
 It feels really strange having the whole middle.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,600
 And this is a new prop because of our series,

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,440
 don't give the enemy a seat at your table.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,280
 So I am sitting here at a table without another chair

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,080
 so the enemy can't sit here.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,720
 Good to see you all.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,920
 What a weekend, eh?

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,600
 It's going to be a big one, isn't it, John?

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,280
 There's the Wimbledon final.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,320
 There's the NBA finals.

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,320
 And every sentence that John starts with this week,

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,320
 every phrase he starts with, it's coming home.

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,440
 It's coming home.

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,640
 And it's going to be-- see, maybe this

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,160
 is where John and I are different.

17
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,280
 John is an optimist.

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,760
 So everything-- it's always going to be coming home.

19
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,040
 But maybe it's the football club that I support.

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,400
 It's a club called Arsenal.

21
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,120
 And it's-- wow.

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:52,720
 Wow.

23
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,520
 So it's a learned behavior that we have,

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,880
 is that never expect too much.

25
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,680
 Because we've experienced so much heartache.

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,680
 So I can tell you it's probably coming home.

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,280
 Maybe.

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,560
 It's going to go to a home.

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,680
 But maybe that's just the way I'm wired.

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,200
 Because that-- at least with Arsenal.

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,400
 We have this saying that-- people

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,720
 have this saying against us, is that we're-- the team

33
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
 are a bunch of fair weather men.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,560
 Fair weather men means they only do well

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,360
 when everything is going really well.

36
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,320
 But when it's raining, or when it's stormy,

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,400
 or as they would say in England, on a cold, dark November

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,320
 night in Stoke-on-Trent, Arsenal always

39
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,280
 loses, because we're just not very good when

40
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,800
 the going gets tough.

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,280
 And maybe that's an interesting one that we all can figure out.

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,760
 Maybe I'll ask you a question to start with.

43
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,600
 What are you like when the going gets tough?

44
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,280
 What are you like when things get a little bit hard?

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,720
 When it gets a bit colder?

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,120
 When it gets a bit rainier?

47
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,760
 When the storms are coming?

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,680
 What are you like?

49
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,080
 In some ways, I guess, when the going gets tough

50
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,480
 is where our true self gets exposed, right?

51
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,760
 It gets revealed.

52
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,840
 Because that's when we finally show who we truly are.

53
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,000
 When everything's going well, when the weather is shining

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,720
 on a perfect May afternoon, Arsenal play very well.

55
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,960
 But when it's cold and dark in November

56
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,000
 in this dark, horrible place called Stoke-on-Trent,

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,240
 they struggle.

58
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,160
 When the going gets tough, they struggle.

59
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,760
 And you see, it's interesting for us,

60
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,600
 because as we're going to look through this series,

61
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,640
 don't give the enemy a seat at your table.

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,440
 It's focusing on Psalm 23.

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
 And you all probably know Psalm 23.

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,080
 It's probably the most famous passage of scripture, right?

65
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,760
 But I wanted to ask you another question.

66
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,480
 If I was to boil down what Psalm 23 is really about,

67
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,160
 what would you say it's about?

68
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,200
 The Lord is my shepherd, and I will dwell in the house

69
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,040
 of the Lord forever.

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,120
 What's it really about?

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,440
 This short chapter, the most famous chapter of six verses,

72
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,880
 what's it really about?

73
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,000
 I think it's about how you face challenges,

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,360
 how you respond.

75
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,720
 They often say, it's not really what happens to you

76
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,320
 that matters, it's how you respond, right?

77
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,440
 In some ways, Psalm 23, which I'm trying to find here,

78
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,560
 is about that.

79
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,080
 It's about how we respond to challenges.

80
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,760
 It's about how much we trust in God,

81
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,560
 and how much we trust in the truth.

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,720
 That's why truth and trust are so similar.

83
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,120
 How much do we trust in God is what Psalm 23 is about.

84
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,280
 And I wanted to go through this

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,680
 because it's very important as we look at

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,520
 how we don't give the enemy a seat at the table.

87
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,640
 It really comes down to how tight

88
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,480
 are we holding on to truth?

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,360
 You see, one thing that is for sure,

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,640
 if we invite the enemy to our table,

91
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,880
 he really wants to bring about our destruction.

92
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,880
 That's his purpose, that's his goal.

93
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,040
 And how does he often do that?

94
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,240
 Through deceit, through lies,

95
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,320
 through the very thing against truth.

96
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,400
 That's how he does it.

97
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,640
 He wants to tell you, he wants you to feel

98
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,080
 that you have no value, that you have no worth,

99
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,640
 that you have no purpose, that no one loves you.

100
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,240
 Nicky Gumbel often shares a story that's been in my head,

101
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,360
 and I'm paraphrasing it 'cause I don't remember all of it,

102
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,480
 but he's telling this imaginary story

103
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,720
 of the devil talking to his demons,

104
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,520
 and they're scheming on how to distract

105
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,360
 the people of earth from God.

106
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,040
 And they're like, "Oh, what about if we feed them the lie

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
 "that all they need is money, sex, and power?"

108
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,120
 And he's like, "No, no, no,

109
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,440
 "because at some point they'll find out.

110
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,920
 "At some point, as they go down this road,

111
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,280
 "they'll realize that that doesn't fulfill."

112
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,960
 And fast forward to the end, he says,

113
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,600
 "The best lie that we can tell them

114
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,400
 "is that there is no hurry,

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,560
 "that there may be a God, that he really may love you,

116
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,920
 "that you really should follow him,

117
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,720
 "but the lie is there's no hurry.

118
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,800
 "Let's feed them the lie that there is no hurry,

119
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
 "that they can put it back to tomorrow.

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,520
 "Maybe that's the most dangerous lie."

121
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,160
 So how are we supposed to face these kinds of lies?

122
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,000
 How are we supposed to face this kind of deceit?

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,440
 By looking at the word of God, by looking at the truth.

124
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
 And I would say in the whole of scripture,

125
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,280
 Psalm 23 is probably the most powerful,

126
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,160
 most potent, most appropriate passage

127
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,760
 for how you respond to challenges,

128
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,640
 how you face the enemy.

129
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,680
 Because in Ephesians chapter six,

130
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,600
 Paul talks about the whole armor of God.

131
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,360
 And what's the sword of the spirit?

132
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,000
 It's the word of God.

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,120
 So the question really is, how well do we know Psalm 23?

134
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,560
 Those of us who have been in the church for a long time

135
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,160
 will have sang songs about Psalm 23, right?

136
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
 How well do we know?

137
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,520
 Do we know it off by heart?

138
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,840
 Do we know it in our hearts?

139
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,520
 And I wanted to read it to you first.

140
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,760
 I want to just recite it to you,

141
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,280
 but I want you to think about this.

142
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,680
 When David is writing this passage, these six verses,

143
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,800
 what is he really saying?

144
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,920
 What does he want us to know?

145
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,760
 When he says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

146
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,880
 He makes me lie in green pastures.

147
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,200
 He leads me beside still waters.

148
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,520
 He restores my soul.

149
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,520
 He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name's sake.

150
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,880
 Even though I walk through the valley

151
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,800
 of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil

152
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,480
 for you are with me, your rod and your staff,

153
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,480
 they comfort me.

154
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,520
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

155
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,720
 You anoint my head with oil and my cup overflows.

156
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,640
 Surely, goodness and mercy will follow me

157
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,280
 all the days of my life, and I shall dwell

158
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,720
 in the house of the Lord forever."

159
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,600
 That is the word of God.

160
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,400
 That is the truth that we should be following.

161
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
 That is the truth that we should be remembering

162
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
 in our hearts, living it.

163
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,120
 Psalm 23 is an interesting one,

164
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,400
 'cause where do you hear about Psalm 23 the most?

165
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,720
 Where do you hear it read the most?

166
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 Funerals, 'cause it's always associated with death, right?

167
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,560
 Dying, it's the encouragement for everyone.

168
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,280
 But what I want to propose to you today,

169
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,600
 what I want to present to you today

170
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,480
 is it isn't really just about death.

171
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,920
 In fact, it's much more about living than you realize.

172
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,240
 Confession to make, John last week when he was sharing,

173
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,440
 he gave you all a preview saying,

174
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,320
 "James is gonna present a Psalm 23 remix."

175
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,840
 And I was listening to that bit, and I was like,

176
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,800
 "Oh, I am," 'cause I hadn't written the sermon at that time,

177
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,360
 and I suddenly was wondering what kind of remix should I do?

178
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
 You definitely don't want to hear me rap.

179
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,480
 That's a definite no-no.

180
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,320
 - Oh, come on.

181
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,840
 (audience laughing)

182
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,440
 - And then I thought, you know what?

183
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,520
 And I was like, "God, please tell me.

184
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,960
 Please tell me how to make this kind of interesting

185
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,080
 for all these brothers and sisters

186
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,440
 who probably know this passage very well."

187
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,520
 And then it occurred to me,

188
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,480
 if we're talking about not giving the enemy

189
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,200
 a seat at the table, what if we did?

190
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,600
 What if we did let the enemy sit here?

191
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,920
 And what if we did believe in his lies?

192
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,080
 What if we let him distort this truth?

193
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,800
 I want to present to you the, well, I just recited

194
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,440
 the Lord is my shepherd in the ESV,

195
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,360
 the English Standard Version,

196
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,560
 but I wanted to present to you a different version today

197
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,520
 in parallel, which is the ERV, the Enemy Remixed Version.

198
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,640
 And this is what it is.

199
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,560
 I want to show you the real scripture, the real truth,

200
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,240
 but when you compare it to what I have imagined.

201
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,160
 Now, disclaimer, I wrote it myself, okay?

202
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,760
 But it was me asking, "James, what would happen

203
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,520
 if I let the enemy have a seat at my table?

204
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,720
 How would he distort this scripture?

205
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,760
 And how would it make me feel?"

206
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,240
 So this is my own interpretation.

207
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,880
 I'm not the most creative kind of person.

208
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,480
 And I welcome you to go back

209
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,920
 and maybe you can rewrite your own one,

210
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,200
 your own Remixed Version,

211
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,400
 because I think it's very important.

212
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,960
 It really helped me.

213
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,040
 So I want to go through each verse.

214
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,560
 There's only six, and I want to really go through them.

215
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,880
 The first verse, of course, is,

216
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,000
 "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."

217
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,520
 John, last week, emphasized the word my.

218
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,400
 The Lord is my shepherd.

219
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,280
 There's this intimacy that comes with it.

220
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,200
 He's mine.

221
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,040
 He knows me.

222
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,880
 He cares for me.

223
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,840
 It's actually a really interesting way,

224
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,720
 a good way to meditate, if those of you who are learning

225
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,720
 and struggling, is taking a sentence such as that,

226
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,160
 "The Lord is my shepherd," and emphasizing different words,

227
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,040
 and spending time emphasizing different words.

228
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
 So the Lord is my shepherd.

229
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,280
 Jesus is my shepherd.

230
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,440
 The Lord is my shepherd.

231
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,960
 The Lord is my shepherd.

232
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,400
 Actually, David would have very well known

233
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
 what a shepherd had to do.

234
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
 He was a shepherd boy himself.

235
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,720
 But actually, back in those days,

236
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,120
 for someone who was reading that,

237
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,480
 shepherd actually had an even stronger connotation,

238
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,800
 which was king.

239
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,400
 Someone who had authority over something.

240
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,600
 Someone who cared for something, a leader.

241
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
 So what David is saying here is,

242
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
 "The Lord is my shepherd.

243
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,440
 "He is my king.

244
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,400
 "He knows me.

245
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,080
 "He cares for me.

246
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,240
 "And he looks after me.

247
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,200
 "And I shall not want.

248
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,560
 "And I shall not want."

249
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,440
 But what if you imagined if this was done

250
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,040
 in a remixed version, and it comes up here?

251
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,880
 If I was to flip it and translate it,

252
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,160
 if I was to invite the enemy to come and distort this truth,

253
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,520
 it would sound something like this.

254
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,640
 I have no one to lead me.

255
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,680
 No one who cares.

256
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,360
 Nothing ever seems enough.

257
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,200
 And as I present these parallels to you,

258
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,840
 I want you to think, which one do you resonate more with?

259
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,000
 Which one do you believe more with?

260
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,080
 Now, maybe in your head, you should believe the real one,

261
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,240
 but what about your actions?

262
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,680
 What about your actual thinking,

263
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,760
 your feeling, your emotions?

264
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,080
 Which one resonates with you more?

265
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,200
 See, when he says, "The Lord is my shepherd,"

266
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,240
 he's saying, "I have someone to lead me.

267
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,280
 "I have someone who cares.

268
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,960
 "I have a king.

269
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,040
 "And because I have him, there is nothing that I need."

270
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,800
 Jesus himself introduces himself as the good shepherd.

271
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,800
 In John chapter 10, John chapter 10, he says this.

272
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,640
 Verse 11, "I am the good shepherd."

273
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,800
 This is just after the famous verse 10,

274
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,640
 which is, "The thief comes only to steal

275
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,760
 "and kill and destroy.

276
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,120
 "I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."

277
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,040
 So Jesus talks about being the good shepherd.

278
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
 And what does he mean by that?

279
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,320
 If you study John chapter 10,

280
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
 you will see he's talking about he gives food,

281
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,680
 he protects, he sustains life.

282
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,800
 So Jesus is saying, "I am the good shepherd."

283
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,760
 You see, this is what he's saying.

284
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,000
 This is what David is saying here.

285
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,800
 He's saying, "If you let Jesus lead you,

286
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,960
 "you will find contentment.

287
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,400
 "You won't need anything else.

288
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,280
 "But if you don't let Jesus lead you,

289
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,520
 "you will find disappointment.

290
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,200
 "If you let Jesus lead you, you will find contentment.

291
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,560
 "There will be nothing else that you need.

292
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,920
 "But if you don't let him lead you,

293
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,280
 "you will find disappointment."

294
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,120
 Our job as a church, I strongly believe this,

295
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,440
 as Kongfolk Church, my organisation, Young Life,

296
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,160
 the whole point, why we exist,

297
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,520
 why all of us should be here,

298
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,360
 is to point people to Jesus

299
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,920
 and to tell them that Jesus is their shepherd.

300
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,160
 He can be the one to lead them.

301
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,840
 They should follow him.

302
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,480
 You see, there's something interesting here.

303
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,840
 Because if we don't tell them that,

304
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,840
 if we don't tell them that Jesus should be the one

305
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,760
 that you should be following,

306
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,640
 they will follow someone else.

307
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,160
 They will follow something else.

308
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,760
 They will follow the world.

309
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,680
 They will follow the role models of the world.

310
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,560
 It's our job as his body to point them to the good shepherd,

311
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,200
 the one who can lead them.

312
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,000
 Jesus says something fascinating here

313
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,040
 in John chapter 10, verse 12.

314
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,400
 He says this.

315
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,240
 He says, "I am the good shepherd.

316
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,040
 "He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd

317
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,080
 "who does not own the sheep,

318
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,400
 "sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees.

319
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,880
 "And the wolf snatches them.

320
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,680
 "He flees because he is a hired hand

321
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,480
 "and cares nothing for the sheep."

322
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,120
 He's saying, "Hey, if you don't follow me,

323
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,160
 "and if you follow other things,

324
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,960
 "if you follow the world,

325
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,680
 "as soon as there's trouble, they will leave you

326
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,640
 "because they don't really care for you.

327
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,480
 "They are not here to protect you.

328
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,280
 "So follow me.

329
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,480
 "And if you follow me,

330
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,920
 "you won't have anything that you need.

331
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,840
 "If you don't follow me, you will always be in need

332
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,840
 "and nothing, nothing will ever seem enough."

333
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,720
 Are we okay?

334
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,560
 Are we with me?

335
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,880
 So verse one, "The Lord is my shepherd.

336
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,440
 "I shall not want."

337
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,080
 So the question is, who's your shepherd?

338
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,240
 Who's been leading you as you navigate the path of life?

339
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,400
 Is it yourself?

340
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,560
 Is it someone else in the world who doesn't follow Jesus?

341
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,920
 Is it the blind leading the blind?

342
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,240
 Can you say from the bottom of your heart

343
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,520
 that the Lord is your shepherd?

344
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,840
 Because if you can, then you shall not want.

345
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,560
 Verse two says this, "He makes me lie in green pastures.

346
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,560
 "He leads me beside still waters.

347
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,400
 "He restores my soul."

348
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,480
 He paints this picture that God knows what you need.

349
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,040
 He'll lead you to a place where there's green pastures.

350
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,640
 He'll lead you to a place where there's still waters.

351
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,200
 What are the significances of those?

352
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,920
 Okay, if you're sheep, you need to eat.

353
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,520
 So then you go to these green pastures

354
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,920
 to the point where it's plentiful, it's everywhere.

355
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,120
 So you actually get to lie down.

356
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,920
 So a sheep can actually lie down

357
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,280
 and know that they have everything that they need.

358
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,680
 Why still waters?

359
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,640
 Sheep would have to go to the riverside to drink water.

360
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,280
 But if the water was running too fast,

361
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,720
 if the current was too fast,

362
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,440
 then they would get their wool wet, they would get heavy,

363
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,280
 and then they would run the risk of being swept away,

364
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,600
 whisked away, and be in danger.

365
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,240
 So David is saying here, if the Lord is your shepherd,

366
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,480
 he will lead you, he will take you to places

367
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,240
 where you can lie down, where you can stop,

368
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,960
 where you will have everything that you need,

369
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,040
 that you don't have to keep chasing and chasing and chasing,

370
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,760
 because in him, there will be enough.

371
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:44,600
 This is in direct contrast with a city like Hong Kong.

372
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,480
 I've said this before, right?

373
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,720
 Hong Kong is probably one of the hardest places

374
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,880
 to find peace, to stop.

375
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,240
 Christina and I, we took our kids this week on a holiday.

376
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,160
 We went all the way, we went really far,

377
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,080
 all the way to Lantau, and we went to Disneyland.

378
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
 And it was a great time.

379
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,640
 Disneyland is always a fun place to be.

380
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,280
 It's the happiest place on earth.

381
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,320
 But you know what I found something really interesting is?

382
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,600
 We couldn't switch off either,

383
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,280
 because when you're at Disneyland,

384
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,440
 you've got so many things that you need to get to.

385
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,280
 You need to make the most of everything.

386
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,480
 And as hotel guests, we were given these fast passes,

387
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,680
 which it didn't feel right if we let them go to waste.

388
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
 So we have to go through everything.

389
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,520
 And in the hotel, there's tons of things that you can do.

390
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,800
 You can go go-karting.

391
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,040
 You can do Tai Chi with Donald Duck.

392
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,840
 (audience laughing)

393
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,000
 No, no, no, that wasn't a joke.

394
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,200
 You actually can do Tai Chi with Donald Duck.

395
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,120
 Small plug there.

396
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,440
 And I found myself getting caught up in this,

397
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,040
 'cause I need to make the most of it.

398
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,120
 I need to go to all these different things.

399
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,320
 But what Jesus is saying here,

400
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,800
 what Davies is saying is about Jesus,

401
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,520
 if you follow him, you will get to a point

402
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,400
 where you can lie down,

403
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,160
 where you will be surrounded by everything that you need

404
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,880
 that you won't even need to move that far.

405
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,360
 And you'll be beside still waters

406
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,240
 where you don't feel as though

407
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,920
 you have to go and fight for everything yourself.

408
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,440
 Now, there's two, generalizing,

409
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,480
 there's two schools of thought that you probably buy into.

410
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,800
 You probably have a Western mindset

411
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,720
 where it's kind of like,

412
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,000
 I need to grasp everything myself.

413
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,760
 I need to take hold of my destiny.

414
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,400
 I need to chase my dreams and my ambitions.

415
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,360
 Everything is me.

416
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,400
 Take up, look after number one first.

417
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,800
 Well, you've got the other side, the Eastern side,

418
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,880
 which is you need to work very hard

419
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,160
 to gain any kind of approval.

420
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,600
 You need to prove and justify your existence.

421
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,320
 You won't receive any love

422
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,840
 unless you work very, very, very hard.

423
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,440
 You see, the problem with both of these mindsets

424
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,800
 is that they both will leave you wanting more.

425
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,960
 They both will get you to a point

426
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,280
 where actually it's not enough.

427
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,920
 Nothing ever seems enough.

428
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,040
 And what David is saying here is stop.

429
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,000
 He says it later in Psalm 46,

430
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,120
 be still and know that I am God.

431
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,600
 If you actually look at the context of Psalm 46,

432
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,920
 they're actually talking about nations raging

433
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,480
 and fighting against each other.

434
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,280
 So that be still isn't be still and just chill.

435
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,200
 It's drop your weapons, kind of stop.

436
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,680
 It's stop what you're doing right now.

437
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,200
 And I feel as though we need to hear that.

438
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,880
 For those of us in Hong Kong,

439
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,320
 that we need to hear stop, drop whatever you're doing

440
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,680
 and be still and know that I am God.

441
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,680
 Because hurry, because busyness is directly against

442
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,440
 how the kingdom of God works.

443
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,440
 And you see it time and time again in scripture

444
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,680
 that Jesus never seems rushed.

445
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,280
 And he invites you in to be still,

446
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,920
 to lie down in the green pastures,

447
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,080
 to be beside the still waters.

448
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,800
 Third verse is this, he leads me,

449
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,040
 oh, sorry, the remix version is this.

450
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,000
 It's like I'm stranded in the desert,

451
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,200
 desperate for something to quench my thirst,

452
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,960
 but no matter how hard I try, I always feel empty.

453
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,760
 Which of these versions describes you more?

454
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,600
 Which of these versions describes you?

455
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,440
 Because it will give you a hint as to who is your shepherd,

456
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,560
 who's actually leading you.

457
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,440
 Are you stranded in the desperate desert?

458
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,040
 Are you desperately finding something

459
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,480
 to quench this thirst?

460
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,800
 Do you think there's something inside you

461
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,280
 that seems to need to be fulfilled,

462
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,520
 but you just keep finding it?

463
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,120
 You're trying to find it, but you never seem to succeed.

464
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,760
 You find all these other things that fill it temporarily,

465
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,360
 but then you always get to that point

466
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,160
 where again, it's not enough.

467
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,680
 Have a think, who is your shepherd?

468
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,440
 Now, verse three, he leads me in paths of righteousness

469
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,040
 for his name's sake.

470
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,960
 The paths of righteousness isn't something too mysterious.

471
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,680
 It simply means he leads you down the right path

472
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,840
 so you won't get lost.

473
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,960
 He's taking you down the right route.

474
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,200
 He leads you there for his name's sake,

475
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
 which basically means it's in his nature.

476
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,480
 It's who he is.

477
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,200
 That's what we were singing, that God is good.

478
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,080
 God, you're so good.

479
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,760
 I'm so glad we sang that song.

480
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,440
 Actually, both of them, "The Goodness of God."

481
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,560
 Because I think very often we don't associate good with God.

482
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,440
 I think most of the time we think about him

483
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,280
 as this just distant being,

484
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,840
 this one that we should be afraid of,

485
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,920
 who's gonna send lightning down to destroy us

486
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
 if we misbehave.

487
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,560
 But do you understand that he's a good God?

488
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,440
 Do you let that permeate your soul?

489
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,240
 Do you recognise, do you realise that he is actually good?

490
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,080
 What does that mean?

491
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,240
 It means that he knows what's best for you

492
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,160
 and that he cares for you, that he is faithful.

493
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,080
 So for his name's sake, what is his character?

494
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,120
 He is good and he is faithful.

495
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,360
 I'm reminded again of Mr. Beaver telling Lucy,

496
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,280
 describing Aslan.

497
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,560
 This is the Chronicles of Narnia,

498
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,160
 for those of you who don't know,

499
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,080
 where Aslan is this lion that basically represents God.

500
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,400
 And this little girl is asking, "Who is this Aslan?"

501
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,760
 And she's asking a talking beaver, of course, as you would.

502
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,520
 And Mr. Beaver says, "Oh, he's not safe.

503
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
 "In fact, he's pretty dangerous.

504
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,920
 "He's pretty powerful, but he's good."

505
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:03,920
 Do you believe that, that God truly is good,

506
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,280
 that he knows what's best for you?

507
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,560
 So during this time, as you walk this path,

508
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,400
 sometimes it feels like a detour.

509
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,760
 If you truly follow God,

510
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,200
 there will be paths that you take,

511
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,920
 they will be like, "Hmm, are we sure?

512
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,520
 "Is this the way to be going?"

513
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,880
 But if you are truly following God,

514
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,320
 if Jesus truly is your shepherd and your eyes are on him,

515
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,280
 then you can trust in him and your job

516
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,120
 is to stay close to him.

517
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,160
 It's to stay close to him and remember that he is good,

518
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,680
 that he cares for you and he knows what's best for you

519
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,120
 and he is faithful.

520
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,760
 God, you're so good.

521
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,600
 Because you need to know that

522
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,000
 and you need to remember that because of the next verse.

523
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,040
 So you just etch that into your minds that God is good

524
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,280
 because the next verse puts that to the test.

525
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,200
 Next verse is probably the most famous part of Psalm 23,

526
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,840
 maybe the most popular part, definitely for sure,

527
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,160
 to the point where Coolio in "Gangster's Paradise"

528
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,200
 steals it and copies it as well, uses it.

529
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,720
 "Even though I walk through the valley

530
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,000
 "of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil,

531
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,960
 "for you are with me, your rod and your staff,

532
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,920
 "they comfort me."

533
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,480
 Wait a minute, verse three just said

534
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,800
 that you will lead me down the right path.

535
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,800
 And now you're saying you're gonna lead me down a path

536
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,760
 of the valley of the shadow of death.

537
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,360
 What's going on here?

538
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,440
 Why is he doing this?

539
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,120
 See, that's the problem, right?

540
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,080
 You see, for us believers, often we think

541
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,480
 that as soon as we believe in God,

542
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,240
 our life should be completely blissful and blessed.

543
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,800
 We should be like the poem, "Footprints in the Sand,"

544
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,080
 just strolling along the beach, enjoying time with God.

545
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,760
 But then we look at Jesus and we think,

546
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,400
 "Oh, actually, no, his life didn't seem

547
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,480
 "that blissful and blessed."

548
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,120
 But then why?

549
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,320
 Why does he lead us down this right path

550
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,840
 that ends up being the valley of the shadow of death?

551
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,760
 See, David knew.

552
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,360
 David, as a shepherd, knew that when he was looking

553
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,880
 after sheep, he would take them to the green pastures,

554
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,600
 he would take them to the still waters,

555
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,680
 but to get there, you need to go through the valleys.

556
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,640
 To get there, you need to lead the sheep to the valleys

557
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,520
 over avalanches, over raging rivers, over rock slides.

558
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,560
 To get there, to get to the places where they could feed,

559
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,520
 they have to take this treacherous road.

560
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,360
 That is why we need those valleys.

561
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,720
 And sometimes you think, "Oh, that shouldn't be the case.

562
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,360
 "I wanna stay on the mountaintop.

563
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,520
 "I wanna stay and enjoy the view here forever."

564
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
 But you see, here's the problem.

565
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
 Oswald Chambers says this,

566
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,320
 that mountaintops are only there for inspiration.

567
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,440
 If there's a mountain, that means there has to be a valley.

568
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,800
 Now, we're not there yet at the end

569
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
 where we can enjoy all of that forever,

570
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,680
 so we need to keep going.

571
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,000
 And to keep going, we have to go back down,

572
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,160
 and we have to go to these valleys.

573
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,400
 And this is why we need to remember

574
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,680
 the truth of this chapter,

575
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,440
 because we need to know that challenges and suffering

576
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,240
 are a part of the human experience,

577
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,760
 not apart from the human experience.

578
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,520
 To be human means at some point you have to suffer.

579
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,040
 No one here is immortal.

580
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,680
 At some point, we will have to suffer.

581
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,520
 We will have to die.

582
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:17,000
 And so for us, we would do well to remember

583
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,200
 that as we go through the challenges of life,

584
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,400
 that actually our eyes just need to remain on Him,

585
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,960
 because He will lead us.

586
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,800
 Something else here.

587
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,560
 This valley of the shadow of death, He walks through it.

588
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,840
 This tells me two things.

589
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,320
 Number one, it means we're not trapped there.

590
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,160
 Do you get it?

591
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,520
 Sometimes when you're in a troublesome situation

592
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,240
 or when you're in a challenge,

593
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,160
 you feel as though, "Oh my goodness, I'm gonna die.

594
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,760
 "This is gonna be forever."

595
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,640
 Do we feel like that?

596
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,160
 Sometimes whenever we face these things,

597
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,560
 we're just wondering, "When is it gonna end?"

598
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,600
 But we have to remember that these valleys,

599
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,760
 we will walk through, that it is not the end.

600
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,400
 You have to believe in that cheesy saying,

601
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,040
 and I'm a kind of cheesy kind of guy,

602
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,040
 is everything will be okay in the end,

603
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,720
 and if it's not okay, then it's not the end.

604
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,560
 So therefore you keep walking.

605
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,880
 So you're not trapped there.

606
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,800
 We have to walk through this valley.

607
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,400
 But you also, second point, you also can't run.

608
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,000
 Sometimes when we face challenges,

609
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,480
 the first thing we wanna do is get away from it

610
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,320
 as quick as possible,

611
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,040
 to get through it as quick as possible.

612
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,600
 I do this when I go to the gym.

613
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,960
 Christina can go to the gym for two, three hours straight,

614
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,400
 just constantly going.

615
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,480
 That's why she is like abnormally strong.

616
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,000
 (audience laughing)

617
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,240
 But I like to go to the gym

618
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
 and make sure I've ticked the boxes off as fast as I can,

619
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,320
 and anything more than 20 minutes is too long.

620
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,600
 And then I spend the rest of the time in the jacuzzi,

621
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,960
 where I wait for Christina.

622
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,440
 But sometimes I feel like that.

623
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,800
 Any challenges, actually I'm a guy

624
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,720
 that's like the path of least resistance.

625
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,600
 So if I'm walking in shops, or walking along the streets,

626
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,280
 and I see that I can pass through this shop

627
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,400
 to get some air conditioning, I will go through it.

628
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,720
 I will enjoy the air con,

629
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,560
 and I will do whatever it takes

630
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,960
 to make my life as easy as possible.

631
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,320
 That's me.

632
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,000
 But you see, but I'm reminded here

633
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,400
 that the Christian life is not like that.

634
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,240
 That's not what scripture tells us.

635
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,520
 That's not the truth.

636
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,760
 There are challenges that we constantly have to face.

637
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,800
 So we're not trapped in them,

638
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,880
 but we also can't run through them.

639
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,600
 We have to walk through this valley.

640
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,480
 See, the word for death here means extreme danger, peril.

641
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,360
 But it's also just a shadow.

642
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,280
 I walked through the valley of the shadow of death.

643
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,400
 Someone once said, "I'd much rather be hit

644
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,320
 "by the shadow of a bus than by a bus itself."

645
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,240
 Shadows are not things that are gonna destroy you.

646
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,960
 It was Ruth Renkel that said, "Never fear shadows,

647
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,880
 "because it only means that there is a light nearby."

648
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,640
 So we walk through this valley of the shadow of death

649
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,480
 with confidence because we know that He is with us.

650
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,240
 Jesus is saying, John 16, 33,

651
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,760
 "In this world, you will have trouble,

652
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,640
 "but take heart, I have overcome the world, and follow me.

653
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,520
 "You are with me."

654
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,440
 Now it's interesting here because David here

655
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,720
 goes from the third person, the Lord is my shepherd.

656
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,440
 He makes me, He leads me, He restores, He leads.

657
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,760
 To now changing in verse four to, "You are with me."

658
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,840
 He heightens the level of intimacy.

659
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,080
 He's saying that Jesus really is with me.

660
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,040
 "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

661
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,840
 Your rod and the staff are two tools

662
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,760
 that a shepherd would have whilst looking after the sheep

663
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,040
 to protect them, to count them, to guide them,

664
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,120
 to tell them off, to rebuke them, to rescue them.

665
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,560
 But both tools require close proximity.

666
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,240
 So he's saying, "I won't have to fear

667
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,560
 "as I walk through this because Jesus, you,

668
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,560
 "my good shepherd, you are with me.

669
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,640
 "And your rod and your staff, they deliver me."

670
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,920
 No, they help me escape.

671
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,160
 No, "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."

672
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,480
 So we see here, no promise of immunity,

673
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,880
 no promise of deliverance.

674
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,520
 He's saying that in your trials, in your suffering,

675
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,400
 whatever you're going through right now,

676
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,400
 Jesus is with you to comfort you, to get through this.

677
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,720
 And Romans talks about this because it's in the suffering

678
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,000
 that you will then persevere,

679
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,960
 and then you'll gain character, and then you'll have hope.

680
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,880
 So he is with you.

681
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,240
 And really the crux of this,

682
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,880
 the key point of this verse is this.

683
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,680
 "Even though I will, even though I walk

684
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,400
 "through the valley of the shadow of death,

685
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,360
 "I will fear no evil."

686
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,040
 That's it.

687
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,880
 If you're gonna, this is my favorite part of sermons

688
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,720
 that I'm listening to,

689
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,680
 'cause it's the way the preacher goes.

690
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,560
 If you forget everything else in the sermon, remember this.

691
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,760
 And now you're all paying attention

692
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,480
 just for another five seconds.

693
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,400
 "Even though I will."

694
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,360
 I want you to hold onto that.

695
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,280
 I want you to think about your situation.

696
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,600
 Even though I'm going through this problem at work,

697
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,160
 even though I'm going through this problem with my marriage,

698
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,200
 even though my kids are struggling with this,

699
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,040
 even though the world seems to be falling apart

700
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,840
 because of a pandemic and politics,

701
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,480
 even though, even though, even though I'm in a chemo ward,

702
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,640
 even though I will trust in the Lord.

703
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,040
 I will.

704
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,160
 You have to will yourself to do it.

705
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,680
 You have to remind yourself to do it.

706
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,720
 What is your even though?

707
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,960
 What is your even though I will?

708
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,560
 Because as I said at the beginning,

709
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,480
 it's not what happens to you that matters,

710
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,960
 it's how you respond.

711
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,920
 So even though you are going through this,

712
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:52,320
 the reminder is, but you will do this.

713
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,160
 You will praise the Lord.

714
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,600
 You will trust in God.

715
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,080
 Reminded of in the book of Daniel in the Old Testament,

716
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,760
 Daniel's friends, they were under threat.

717
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,120
 They refused to worship this king as their God.

718
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,360
 And so they were getting threatened

719
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,640
 to being thrown into a blazing furnace.

720
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,480
 And what do they say here?

721
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,240
 Daniel three, I think it's on the slides, verse 17.

722
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,360
 They say this, "If we are thrown in the blazing furnace,

723
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,240
 "the God we serve is able to deliver us from it.

724
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,760
 "And he will deliver us from your majesty's hand."

725
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:23,920
 But here's the key.

726
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,040
 But even if he does not, we want you to know your majesty,

727
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,080
 that we will not serve your gods

728
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,400
 or worship the image of God you have set up.

729
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,360
 Even if God doesn't deliver me from this thing,

730
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,160
 even if, even though I'm still struggling with this,

731
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,040
 I will still trust him.

732
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,400
 I will still worship him.

733
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,280
 Again, in the Old Testament, Habakkuk, a minor prophet,

734
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,720
 during the time where the Israelites

735
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,080
 were being ruled over by the Babylonians.

736
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,880
 He had this passage that says this,

737
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,680
 "Though the fig tree should not blossom,

738
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,840
 "nor fruit beyond the vines,

739
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,640
 "the produce of the olive fail,

740
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,240
 "and the fields yield no flock."

741
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,960
 Basically, if everything goes wrong,

742
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,160
 "The flock be cut off from the fold,

743
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,400
 "and there be no herd in the stalls.

744
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,480
 "Yet I will rejoice."

745
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,360
 Brothers and sisters, that's it.

746
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,680
 If you are able to latch on and understand

747
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,000
 and believe that mindset of, "Even though I will,"

748
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,640
 then you can stick to the truth.

749
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,600
 You can remember what the truth is,

750
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,880
 and you can fight off, you can fend off the enemy's lies.

751
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,280
 I'm reminded of Acts 16, Paul and Silas,

752
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,840
 they're arrested for spreading the gospel.

753
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,440
 They're beaten.

754
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,600
 They are put in prison.

755
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,040
 Acts 16, and what happens?

756
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,040
 They're no doubt lying on the floor in prison.

757
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,920
 No doubt, at that point,

758
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,360
 they could feel sorry for themselves, but they don't.

759
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,880
 What does scripture say they do?

760
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
 They're singing praises.

761
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,760
 Can you imagine just lying on a prison cell floor,

762
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,600
 completely just bleeding?

763
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,280
 Even though, yet I will.

764
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,320
 Even though I will.

765
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,560
 What's your even though?

766
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,600
 Verse five, "You prepare a table before me

767
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,480
 "in the presence of my enemies.

768
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,000
 "You anoint my head with oil, and my cup overflows."

769
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,200
 The translation of this would be,

770
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,680
 "And now the challenges I face

771
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,120
 "are threatening to destroy me and expose me.

772
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,560
 "I have nothing left to give,

773
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,800
 "and no one coming to my rescue."

774
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,640
 No one coming to my rescue.

775
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,560
 These enemies, these attackers,

776
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,160
 no one is gonna be protecting me.

777
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,520
 See, he moves now.

778
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,320
 He's stopped talking about shepherding,

779
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,280
 and he moves on to hosting.

780
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,760
 And he talks about God inviting him to this table.

781
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
 And you see, this is the interesting thing here.

782
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,160
 David's facing all these troubles,

783
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,320
 and yet what he sees God doing is this.

784
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,640
 In the midst of those challenges,

785
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,000
 in the midst of those challenges,

786
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,600
 whatever, however hard life is sucking right now,

787
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,960
 he sees God telling him, "Sit down."

788
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,000
 He knows the enemies are right there.

789
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,640
 He knows all the challenges are right there,

790
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,200
 and yet God is saying, "Take a seat."

791
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,400
 Let me translate that to maybe modern day language,

792
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,280
 young people language.

793
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,680
 It's God telling all of us, "Hey, eyes on me.

794
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,000
 "Hey, eyes on me.

795
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,800
 "Don't worry about them.

796
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,320
 "They'll still be there, but you, eyes on me.

797
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,560
 "Don't be afraid because I am here,

798
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,360
 "because I have invited you to my table."

799
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:21,160
 And in that culture, if you invite someone to your table,

800
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,360
 that is an honoured guest.

801
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,480
 That is someone who is very, very special.

802
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,680
 And if they're extra special,

803
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,280
 they get anointed with oil on their head,

804
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,240
 which is exactly how David describes it.

805
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,560
 So God's looking at you.

806
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,840
 He's looking at me saying, "Hey, sit down.

807
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,960
 "Drop your weapon.

808
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
 "Be still.

809
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,520
 "Know who I am.

810
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,240
 "It doesn't matter who they are.

811
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,720
 "In the midst of your challenge at work,

812
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,040
 "in the midst of your challenge in your family,

813
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,280
 "in the midst of the chemo ward, sit down.

814
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,240
 "Hey, eyes on me."

815
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,480
 And this cup that overflows symbolises God's provision.

816
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,280
 He's saying, "If I'm with God, if he's my shepherd,

817
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,040
 "I shall not want.

818
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,680
 "I will be in the green pastures.

819
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,040
 "I will be beside the still waters."

820
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,320
 So the question here is, again,

821
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,600
 whatever challenges you're facing,

822
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,240
 whatever enemies you have,

823
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,880
 God is telling you, "Hey, eyes on me.

824
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,280
 "Take a seat.

825
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,400
 "You don't have to be afraid."

826
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,400
 Instead of believing the challenges

827
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,800
 that are threatening you will destroy and expose you,

828
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,880
 know that I have prepared a table for you

829
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,280
 in the presence of your enemies

830
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,640
 because they don't face me at all.

831
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,400
 The goal is for you to keep your eyes on me

832
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,320
 and your cup will overflow.

833
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,520
 And the final verse,

834
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,040
 "Surely goodness and mercy will follow me

835
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,080
 "all the days of my life

836
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,400
 "and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

837
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,160
 The word follow there is redap,

838
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,960
 which actually is stronger than just follow.

839
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,560
 It's pursue, which is why the song that we sang was so good

840
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,200
 because it's, at the end, goodness of God.

841
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,680
 At the end, it's surely your goodness is running after me.

842
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,440
 That's what it actually means.

843
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,240
 God is running after you.

844
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,960
 You see, the flip, the remixed version of this is,

845
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,880
 "I can see no end to the sorrow

846
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,200
 "and grief as my name has only a lifetime of wandering

847
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,480
 "as it's called.

848
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,960
 "I will die alone and with no peace forgotten."

849
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,240
 God's saying, "Hey, look at me.

850
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,040
 "My goodness and mercy will follow you."

851
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,280
 It's chasing after you.

852
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,400
 See, David knew about enemies pursuing him.

853
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,040
 He had King Saul chasing him down.

854
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,680
 He had his son chasing him down.

855
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,760
 But he's saying, "None of those matter

856
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,520
 "if God is chasing me, because God will outrun them.

857
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,320
 "God will overpower them,

858
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,000
 "because those enemies will be rendered harmless

859
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,520
 "if God is in pursuit."

860
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:47,280
 So let us remember that truth.

861
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,360
 Surely goodness and mercy will follow us

862
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,640
 all the days of our lives,

863
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,760
 instead of thinking that we will die alone,

864
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,640
 that we will have no peace,

865
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,760
 that we will be wandering here forever.

866
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,440
 You see, the interesting thing about here,

867
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,520
 and then I'm gonna go into the conclusion, is this.

868
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,080
 We need to remember that God is pursuing us,

869
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,040
 that God is chasing after us,

870
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,160
 because often we think we're chasing after God, don't you?

871
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,200
 Sometimes I do.

872
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,520
 Sometimes I think I'm not a good enough person.

873
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,080
 I need to work harder at being a good person.

874
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,520
 I need to chase after God.

875
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,560
 He's just so far, he's just so distant.

876
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,520
 But that's not the gospel.

877
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,720
 So, and if you believe that,

878
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,760
 I can tell you that is the enemy speaking.

879
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,960
 That means the enemy has got a seat at the table,

880
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,200
 because the gospel is this,

881
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,760
 that God pursues you,

882
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,840
 that he chases after you.

883
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,680
 How?

884
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,120
 He left heaven's throne to come to be with you

885
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,240
 in the form of Jesus, to rescue you.

886
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,240
 He is the one who is pursuing you.

887
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,480
 And the gospel needs us to remember

888
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,880
 that we don't need to chase after the approval of man,

889
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,600
 that we don't need to fear evil,

890
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,800
 because God himself is following us, is pursuing us.

891
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,800
 So that's it.

892
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,720
 We can put the whole Psalm on there now.

893
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,720
 Psalm 23.

894
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,840
 This passage we find is not about funerals.

895
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,000
 It's not about dying.

896
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,800
 It's about living.

897
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,280
 It's about the daily activities that we do,

898
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,000
 but in a radically transformed, God-centered perspective.

899
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,680
 It changes your approach to how you live.

900
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,480
 It doesn't, of course, it should change your approach

901
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,360
 about what death is as well.

902
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,000
 But we can see here, this passage, this chapter,

903
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,840
 tells us that in God, we will find peace, not escape.

904
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,920
 In God, we will find contentment, not complacency.

905
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,280
 In God, we find the answers to everything,

906
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,040
 but the Lord needs to be our shepherd.

907
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,720
 We need to be following Jesus himself,

908
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,960
 that we shouldn't have to worry,

909
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,120
 that God himself will protect us.

910
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,000
 He will provide for us.

911
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,680
 How do we know that?

912
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,040
 Because Jesus is the good shepherd,

913
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,520
 but he also is the sacrificial lamb.

914
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:04,400
 We can trust that he is with us because he's been there,

915
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,760
 because he himself walked through the valley of death,

916
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:12,800
 and he destroyed death so that they are just shadows now.

917
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,000
 So he has put death to death,

918
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,440
 and he's shown us there is something beyond the grave,

919
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,200
 so we don't need to fear evil.

920
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,280
 And as Chinese people fear death, like no other culture,

921
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,560
 everything is about death.

922
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

923
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,120
 Everything is about death.

924
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:39,680
 And Jesus is saying, "Hey, I defeated death.

925
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,920
 "I walked through the valley of death,

926
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,720
 "so to you, they are simply shadows,

927
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,800
 "so you won't have to fear."

928
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,040
 That he resisted the deceiver himself

929
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,640
 with the word of God, with the truth,

930
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,880
 and now he becomes our truth.

931
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,080
 And now he can show you the way.

932
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,360
 Now he can give you the abundant life

933
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,360
 because now he is your way.

934
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,280
 He is the way, the truth, and the life.

935
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,040
 Jesus is saying, "Hey, eyes on me, whatever is happening."

936
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,440
 And he will rescue you from your valley.

937
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,400
 Brothers and sisters, I don't know

938
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,560
 what you're going through.

939
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,160
 I don't know what challenges that you have.

940
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,040
 Everyone has different kinds of challenges.

941
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,800
 But the message I want you to receive and to believe

942
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,080
 is that God is with you, that Jesus is with you,

943
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,040
 whatever it is that you're going through,

944
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,280
 however bad it is, even to the point

945
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,040
 of a tortuous death that may await you,

946
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,760
 Jesus is saying, "I've been there.

947
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,800
 "I have been there and I am with you now.

948
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,920
 "So take heart because I have overcome the world.

949
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,840
 "Hey, eyes on me."

950
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,480
 D.L. Moody has this great quote which says,

951
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,440
 "Death may be the king of terrors,

952
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,440
 "but Jesus is the king of kings."

953
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,680
 Death may be the king of terrors,

954
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,120
 but Jesus is the king of kings.

955
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:08,040
 So as I show you this "Enemy" remixed version,

956
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,360
 how many of those verses have you actually let

957
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,560
 seep into your mind to deceive you?

958
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,160
 Now, once you've seen the "Enemy" remixed version,

959
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,640
 something amazing happens.

960
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:20,240
 When you look back at the real version,

961
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,440
 there is such beauty and encouragement and power in it

962
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,440
 so that you can now say, "Wow, the Lord is my shepherd.

963
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,800
 "I shall not want."

964
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,920
 And you can say that, "He leads me beside

965
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,520
 "its green pastures to still waters.

966
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,640
 "He restores your soul.

967
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,200
 "He leads you in paths of righteousness for his namesake

968
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,880
 "because that is who he is."

969
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,000
 And even though you walk through the valley

970
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,920
 of the shadow of death, you will fear no evil

971
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,000
 for he is with you because his rod and his staff,

972
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,840
 they comfort you.

973
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,040
 And he prepares a table before you

974
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,160
 in the presence of your enemies.

975
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,400
 And he anoints your head with oil and your cup overflows.

976
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,880
 So surely goodness and mercy shall follow you

977
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,120
 all the days of your life.

978
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,760
 Do we get that?

979
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,640
 When you're faced with this "Enemy" version,

980
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,440
 this deceitful version, and then you compare it

981
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,120
 to the glorious truth of what he really is,

982
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,240
 I hope that lifts you.

983
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,000
 I hope that lifts you.

984
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
 And I hope that encourages you to keep your eyes up,

985
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,880
 to look to the shepherd.

986
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,720
 I started with a football conversation

987
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,040
 at the beginning of this.

988
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,960
 And as it's a very special weekend,

989
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,400
 I wanted to finish with a football conversation.

990
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,320
 As I was walking here to church,

991
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,640
 I was somehow, I don't know how,

992
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,040
 I was reminded of the anthem

993
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,440
 that Liverpool Football Club fans sing.

994
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,520
 And I don't really pay much attention

995
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,960
 because I'm a bitter, disappointed,

996
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,160
 frustrated football fan.

997
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,440
 But I was like, man, what such gospel truth

998
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,560
 in that song, "You'll Never Walk Alone."

999
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,080
 Such gospel truth.

1000
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,720
 That whatever you face right now,

1001
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,520
 that you know that you will never walk alone.

1002
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,160
 Not because of the drunk football fans

1003
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,120
 standing next to you singing this song,

1004
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,360
 but because of Jesus.

1005
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,360
 Do you get that?

1006
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,560
 That you'll never walk alone because of Jesus.

1007
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,000
 And I wanted to just to finish

1008
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,080
 with reading the lyrics to that song.

1009
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,240
 I won't sing it to you.

1010
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,520
 John, you probably know this, right?

1011
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,720
 No, you know this, right?

1012
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,200
 When you walk through a storm,

1013
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,200
 hold your head up high

1014
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,000
 and don't be afraid of the dark.

1015
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,600
 At the end of a storm, there's a golden sky

1016
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,160
 and the sweet silver song of a lark.

1017
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,800
 Walk on through the wind, walk on through the rain.

1018
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,720
 Though your dreams be tossed and blown,

1019
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,560
 walk on, walk on.

1020
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,360
 With hope in your heart and you'll never walk alone.

1021
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,440
 You'll never walk alone.

1022
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,240
 Walk on, walk on.

1023
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,880
 With hope in your heart, you'll never walk alone.

1024
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:16,120
 That is a Psalm 23 remixed in a beautiful way.

1025
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,840
 Let's pray.

1026
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:27,440
 Jesus, we believe that you are the good shepherd,

1027
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,400
 that you truly do love us,

1028
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,880
 that you truly do care for us,

1029
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,960
 and that in you, we will have nothing that we need.

1030
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,240
 So give us the strength to follow you

1031
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,120
 to these green pastures and to these still waters.

1032
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,480
 Restore our souls,

1033
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,880
 'cause nothing from this world seems enough, ever.

1034
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,880
 Lead us on the right path.

1035
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,160
 Stop us from getting lost.

1036
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,560
 And even though we walk through the valley

1037
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,720
 of the shadow of death,

1038
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,480
 keep our eyes fixed on you.

1039
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,400
 Give us the strength to lift up our weary heads.

1040
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:11,440
 And let us see your loving eyes.

1041
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,400
 And let us see and feel your goodness.

1042
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,440
 In the presence of our enemies,

1043
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:17,840
 remind us that you are here.

1044
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:22,040
 In the midst of the challenges that we face,

1045
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,040
 give us a peace that allows us to drop our weapons,

1046
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,800
 to be still and know that you are God.

1047
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
 And fill us up, Lord,

1048
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,680
 to the point that our cups overflow.

1049
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:40,040
 And may your goodness and mercy follow us

1050
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,120
 all the days of our lives.

1051
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,080
 And we thank you.

1052
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:51,120
 That we will never walk alone,

1053
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,360
 because you never let go.

1054
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,280
 Amen.

1055
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:05,280
