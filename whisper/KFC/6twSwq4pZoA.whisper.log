[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.580]   Okay, all right, let's get right to it.
[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.240]   So today we're going to be talking about 2 Timothy chapter 2.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.660]   The title is "Charged to Work."
[00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.360]   I didn't get to pick it.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.200]   James did.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:31.720]   But chapter 2 is a letter from 1,956 years ago.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.760]   So it's dated at year 65.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.240]   And it's written from Paul, I drew him, that's how I think Paul looks like.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:49.520]   Paul who is an apostle awaiting execution in Rome to his young protege Timothy, who
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.600]   is a young pastor in Ephesus.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.400]   And he's struggling a bit because partially there's a lot of false teachers in Ephesus.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.720]   And I also think he has some stomach problems and he's timid as mentioned in earlier chapters.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:18.300]   And so this chapter, chapter 2, is a culmination of what Paul has learned from his entire life
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.120]   and has learned throughout his years as an apostle.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.840]   And he's passing it on to Timothy because he's about to die.
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.600]   2 Timothy is the last letter that Paul has written.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.280]   And he's literally awaiting execution in Rome by Emperor Nero, who's a bit of a crazy
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.280]   goon.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.280]   But let me, oh, hello.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.280]   What?
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.280]   Sorry.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.960]   So I'm going to read the passage out to you.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   He says, oh, what?
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.960]   The order of my slides.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   Okay, no slides, no slides.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:02:01.200]   "You then, my child," he says, "be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus and what
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.440]   you've heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust to faithful men who will
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.560]   be also able to teach.
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.760]   Share in suffering as a soldier of Christ.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.240]   No soldier gets entangled with civilian pursuits since his aim is to serve the one who enlisted
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.040]   him.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.280]   An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules, and it is the hardworking
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.920]   farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.020]   Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.520]   Remember Jesus Christ risen from the dead, the offspring of David, David, David, sorry,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.600]   a speech to my gospel for which I'm suffering, bound in chains as a criminal.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.840]   But the word of God is not bound.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.240]   Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.720]   salvation in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.760]   The saying is trustworthy, for if we die with him, we will also live with him.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.720]   If we endure, we will also reign with him.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.360]   If we deny him, he will also deny us.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.560]   And if we are faithless, he remains faithful because he can't deny himself.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.800]   Remind them of these things and charge them before God not to quarrel about words which
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.480]   does no good but only ruins the hearers.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.360]   Yikes, my mom's asleep.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.120]   Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.940]   be ashamed of the word, rightly handling the truth.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.080]   But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness, and
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.640]   their talk will spread like gangrene.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.200]   Among them are Hymenaeus and Philistines who have swerved from the truth.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.120]   They have claimed that the resurrection has already happened, and they're upsetting the
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.200]   faith of some.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.600]   But God's firm foundation stands bearing the seal, the Lord knows those who are his, and
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.360]   let those, let everybody who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.640]   And gave his check, if I'm saying the right thing.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.360]   Now in the great house, there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also clay
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:24.100]   and wood, some for honorable uses and some for dishonorable.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.640]   So if anybody cleanses themselves from what is dishonorable, there will be a vessel for
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.520]   honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.720]   work.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.960]   So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.800]   call on the Lord with a pure heart.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.080]   Have nothing to do with foolish and ignorant controversies.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.280]   You know that they only breed quarrels.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.800]   And let the Lord's servant not be quarrelsome, but kind to everybody.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.440]   Will to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.480]   So that God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of truth, and they
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.160]   may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.040]   him to do his will.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.480]   So that's the passage, and so let's pray.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.320]   Heavenly Father God, thank you so much for this time that we can gather, Lord.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.080]   You're the God of the universe.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.860]   You've created the world, and it's your canvas, your people is your masterpiece, Lord.
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.960]   Thank you for this opportunity that I get to preach, Lord.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.440]   There are so many loved ones in front of me, and because I love them so much, I really
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.340]   want to impress them, but Lord, deliver me from this temptation.
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.220]   Let this not be a showcase of intellectual gymnastics.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.760]   Let this be a mighty display of how your word is alive and active, a double-edged sword
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.900]   pierces through hearts, Lord.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.900]   Lord, I especially lift up those who have fallen away from you, or don't know you yet.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.020]   Lord, I just pray for them that they may experience your goodness through your word, Lord.
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.380]   That instead of choosing themselves to be their own gods, that they will choose you.
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.580]   I pray all these things in your precious name, amen.
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.580]   Liddy, let's get to it.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.020]   All right, what's it?
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.460]   Okay, cool.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:35.100]   So this is what sin looks like, and this is the consequences of sin.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:42.780]   And I love memes, and what I'm trying to say is that sin often looks really attractive,
[00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:52.340]   and it's very hard for us to sort of differentiate what culture is and what truth is.
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:58.860]   And so before we go through a section by section deep dive of the passage, I want us to go
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.340]   through, I want us to play a little game, and I want you to play this game as if your
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.100]   life depends on it, and it's not the squid game, but nobody's gonna die.
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.660]   But I just want you guys to play it seriously.
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.180]   So let us begin.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.540]   This is Joseph Albert's interaction of color.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:26.260]   All right, so all who thinks that the Xs are the same color, raise your hand.
[00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.780]   The Xs with the same color, one, two, three, four, five.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:34.500]   And all who think it's a different color, raise your hand.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.600]   Hold your hand up here.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.820]   You can't tell culture from truth, because ladies and gentlemen, if you can see the bottom,
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.820]   they're connected.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.820]   Color is relative.
[00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.220]   All right, let's play this again.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.780]   All the people who got it wrong, actually, you know what?
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.460]   You guys can still participate.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.900]   Let's continue.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.420]   Raise your hand if you think it's the same color.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.980]   All right, JP, two of them.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.660]   Three, four, five.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:02.700]   All right.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.840]   Raise your hand if you think it's a different color.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.320]   Oh, praise the Lord.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.120]   Do you still think it's the same color?
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.840]   You still think it's the same color?
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   Nah.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.520]   They can't be more different.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.800]   All right, last one, last one, last one.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.320]   Raise your hand if you think it's the same color.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.720]   All right, Clinton, JP, there's one at the back.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.800]   Uncle Vincent, Anshan.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.080]   You think it's the same color?
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.080]   Oh, bless the Lord.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.960]   They're the same color.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:47.000]   So I don't teach art, but I love art, and I'm an artist, so hence this little exercise.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.560]   So much of our definition of things like happiness and work comes from our culture and not from
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.960]   the truth, which is scripture.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.200]   And we often conflate the truth with culture, as we just saw.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.720]   And so I hope this exercise illustrated to you that we must walk by faith and not by
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.920]   sight, because sight is very confusing.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:17.400]   And then I want to talk about sort of confusing God's view of work and man's view of work
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.440]   before we dive into the passage.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.560]   So the pinnacle of God's view of work is actually suffering.
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.360]   And Jesus is the best example.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.120]   He died for our sins.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.560]   And God can really turn nothing into something.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.280]   And really what we're doing on earth right now is just rearranging the atoms that he's
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.840]   created.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.160]   Nothing more than that.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:49.640]   And so one of the signature moves that I think God has done is like he's able to make, what
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:50.720]   is he able to make?
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.280]   He's able to turn betrayal into redemption.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.560]   And in Genesis, Joseph tells his brothers, "What you meant evil against me, God used
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.040]   it for good."
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.160]   And so you can think of suffering as a kind of boot camp, training, heaven prep.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.840]   And then of course, in contrast to the kingdom of God, man's view of work, and the man's
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.400]   view of work, the pinnacle is earning, not suffering.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:19.520]   Where time is not relationship, time is territory, time is money.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.400]   Culture says man needs to succeed at work when they earn the most amount of money in
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.240]   the least amount of time.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.880]   The rich deserves everything, right?
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.560]   From prostitutes to private jets, they deserve everything except suffering.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:41.040]   And I think there's something seriously wrong with our world today because Hong Kong just
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.720]   came out of a report that says there's about 1.65 million people living in poverty in our
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.720]   city.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.840]   That's about one in four of us.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.880]   And then at the same time, in the US, the ultra rich just got richer.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.000]   COVID made the rich 60% richer.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   That's about $1.2 trillion.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.560]   And I don't even know what that number is.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:09.680]   And so I don't understand the economics of it, but just the way culture and work functions
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.320]   in real life is not good.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.720]   Because God intended work for us to provide for his people.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.960]   And we are obviously falling short of that command.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:30.920]   So I've organized the passage into seven habits of godly workers.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:38.280]   And there's this really fun little plug that's plugged into itself to illustrate to you that
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:45.080]   trying to do these things on our own is like plugging a plug into the plug outlet.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:52.240]   It's obviously so stupid and so useless, yet so much of us, Christians or not, that we
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.160]   just try to earn our salvation and it's so terrible.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.600]   So without further ado, let's get into it.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.360]   The first thing is, Paul says to Timothy, "You then, my child, be strengthened by the
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.000]   grace that is in Christ Jesus.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.200]   And what you've heard from me in the presence of many witnesses and trusted faithful men
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.120]   who will be able to teach also."
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.640]   So we got to train the trainers.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.280]   And why do we need to train trainers?
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.280]   What?
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.280]   Sorry.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:28.480]   I thought I lost the page.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.160]   Thank the Lord.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.080]   So he's basically saying, "Hey, kid, look, times are tough.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.760]   He's about to get killed.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.400]   Like Paul's getting killed.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.600]   And then Christians are getting persecuted."
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.160]   So he said, "You got to be strong.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.920]   You got to be strong, but don't rely on yourself like that outlet we just saw.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.640]   Draw strength from Christ, strength that you don't deserve, but it's a gift from God."
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.840]   Another thing, don't make up stuff.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.600]   Stick to what you've heard.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.600]   Don't make up stuff.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.480]   And then go make disciples.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:04.600]   Find faithful men, not fruitful men, not like the type A high-functioning people.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:12.400]   I mean, they can be faithful too, but faithful men who will be able to teach also.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.080]   That's what he's saying.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:21.120]   And why this is important is because we're at church today because it was started by
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.000]   a man named Jesus.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.040]   He made 12 disciples.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.580]   And then 14 years later, there was a guy called Paul on his way to Damascus.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.780]   He got converted.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:41.000]   And then he met with James, who's Jesus' brother and the apostle, not an apostle.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.080]   Hold up.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.080]   Hold up.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.080]   Hold up.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.360]   And then Paul, and then met up with Peter as well, one of the disciples.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.520]   And then the rest was history.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.960]   Fun fact, did you know that in 1929, there was an, I came across this Times article that's
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:04.080]   titled "China," capital letters, colon, "Christian Majority," which reads, "Released by the National
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.120]   Information Bureau in Manhattan was the striking information that seven out of 10 members of
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:14.920]   the new Nationalist Cabinet of the Republic of China are Christians."
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:21.560]   And fast forward 100 years, I read an Economist article that showed a chart that Protestant
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:27.760]   Christians are growing exponentially in China, and by 2030, China may have more Christians
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.400]   than the US.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.560]   And why do we have that?
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.080]   It's because people keep on making disciples.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.680]   They teach the teachers.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.000]   Teachers don't come from a factory.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.440]   You teach them to be teachers.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:45.200]   So the first thing that we ought to do is train the trainers and make disciples.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.200]   Great.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   Boop.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.480]   Oh, this picture.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.000]   I don't think we have time to talk about this picture, but sorry.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   It's a cool pic, though.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   All right.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   Dope.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.080]   The second thing is that it's so comforting.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:10.080]   Thank God that we're not called to be popular, because it's so hard, and I'm not.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.120]   And we're called to be soldiers.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.400]   We're called to be soldiers to wage war against the currents of culture, the seduction of
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   society.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:21.240]   He says, "Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.520]   No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuit since its aim is to serve the one who enlisted
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.400]   him."
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.840]   So basically, God is our commander.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840]   Yes.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.840]   And soldiers are part of a larger army.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.880]   There is no one-person soldier.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.960]   So you can't be a celebrity soldier.
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.480]   I can give you a hundred bucks if you can name a famous soldier.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.680]   Okay, actually, no, never mind.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.920]   There might be some famous soldiers.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:54.920]   But what I'm trying to say is that we should follow the example of this king, King Jehoshaphat,
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:59.740]   which he said, "For we are powerless against this great horde that is coming against us.
[00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.440]   We do not know what to do, but our eyes are set on you."
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.240]   2 Chronicles 20, verse 12.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.680]   And King of Judah was in face of battle.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.440]   And what he chooses to do is to pray to God and set his eyes on God.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:22.520]   And so, oh, nope, not about this slide.
[00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.520]   Cool.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:30.080]   And so, right, in this passage, he talks about, he mentions the soldier, he mentions the farmer,
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.820]   he mentions the athlete.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:37.860]   What I think the three of them have in common is that they're all focused on a prize, having
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.920]   faith that there's going to be a reward.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.940]   And they are all pretty self-disciplined and hardworking because they require patience
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.120]   to do the same thing.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.640]   Soldiers sit in the trenches to wait for the commander.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:56.120]   Runners, I guess they just run back and forth all the time.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.880]   And then farmers are obviously like, you know, weeding out the weeds.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.760]   It's just like, it's just labor.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.180]   And the work is not glamorous.
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.320]   And finally, they're obedient.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:13.760]   So the soldier to the commander, the farmer to the laws of nature, and the runner to the
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.640]   rules, right?
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:23.520]   And God takes obedience, or rather disobedience, very seriously.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.440]   If anybody remembers, when I was studying abroad, I was just so striked by how close
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.880]   the Red Sea or Egypt was to Jerusalem.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:39.760]   And I looked on Google Maps, and it's about six days to walk from Egypt to Jerusalem.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.720]   It's about a nine hour, five minute drive.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.040]   Yet Moses spent 40 years there, just walking around.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.360]   And of the Israelites that spent 40 years there, Joshua and Caleb were the only ones
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.980]   who were able to make it to the promised land from their generation, because they were the
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.320]   only two spies who believed that God was good enough to take them there.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.040]   Not even after splitting the Red Sea.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.040]   Crazy.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.120]   Okay, the third thing is to endure.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.600]   In order to enjoy, you have to endure.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.160]   I think suffering is guaranteed in the Christian life.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:24.160]   In 2 Timothy 3.12, it says, "All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.000]   be persecuted."
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.560]   Suffering brings us closer to God through this kind of redemptive participation in the
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.480]   mystery of Jesus' own suffering.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:40.000]   Yet many of us feel like suffering robs us of human value.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.800]   And that's culture right there.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   You missed it.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.960]   Suffering is a good test, and it reveals what our deepest values and what we've set our
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.120]   hopes on.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:56.320]   So God invites us to work so that we can provide for his people that he loves, which is everyone.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.640]   And I certainly don't love everyone.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.840]   And so loving everyone is like suffering.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.400]   But of course, what God is calling us is to a higher suffering.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:10.160]   It's not like when your mom doesn't do the thing you want her to do, and then you're
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.160]   suffering.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.160]   That's not the suffering that we're talking about.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160]   We're talking about martyrdom.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.760]   We're talking about being persecuted.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:25.760]   And so one thing I really like to sort of remind myself is that, like, I love the saying
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.400]   no pressure, no diamonds.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   I heard it when I was in college.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.400]   Oh, nope.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.400]   Sorry.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.720]   No pressure, no diamonds.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.320]   And so anybody know how diamonds are formed?
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   No?
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.320]   Yes?
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   Yes.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.320]   All right.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.320]   I'll tell it from...
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:50.960]   For those who don't know, it is formed in the ground, and it heats up about to 1,000
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.960]   degrees.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:58.840]   You need about 725,000 pounds per inch of pressure to make diamonds.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.880]   And so in this passage, what is the pressure?
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.840]   The pressure is persecution.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.880]   It's suffering.
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.640]   And what are the diamonds?
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.600]   The diamonds are obviously the rewards that God has promised.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:15.080]   Glory, honor, crowns, inheritance.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:20.560]   If the earth was a first draft, and heaven is the real deal, I don't know about you,
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.080]   but I'm sure it would be lit.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.160]   I don't know what inheritance and crowns look like, but I'm sure God would make it so cool,
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.160]   because on earth he made nudibranchs.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.000]   Oh, I love these sea slugs.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   But just if you think about it, just bottom of the ocean, super ugly things, he made so
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   glorious.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.560]   How much more would the inheritance and glory and crowns be?
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.440]   I bet it would be so lit.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:47.640]   Oh, I have other illustrations.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.560]   Let me check for some basil in my pocket.
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.320]   Let's go back to this side.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.320]   Sorry.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:02.880]   Yeah, and I wanted to quickly just show you how on earth we find all these things that
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.400]   point to this principle that we must endure to enjoy.
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.200]   Olive oil doesn't get made unless it's crushed.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.440]   Wine, similarly, unless it's pressed.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.280]   Basil, if you're gonna make pesto, you gotta pound it.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.280]   If I wanna make you smell this, I'm not gonna just like, "Here, smell this."
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:24.920]   I would like, "Now smell this."
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.920]   Oopsies.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:28.560]   And it smells really great.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.000]   And then I love the saying in Chinese.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   There's a tea egg up here.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.840]   They say, "Yan sang zheng cha yi dan, yu duo li han yu yap mei."
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.840]   And I totally agree.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.440]   It says, "Life is like a tea egg.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.540]   The more cracks you have, the more delicious it becomes."
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:49.960]   Because of course, the soy sauce stuff doesn't get marinated if there's no cracks.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.280]   And so I think we need to endure to enjoy.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:02.200]   And I just wanna quickly point out in this poem is that the implications of our work
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.520]   really matter.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.800]   There's like a cause and effect.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.440]   If we endure, we'll also reign with him.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:12.320]   But if we deny him, he will also deny us.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:19.480]   And earlier on, I mentioned the verse that Jesus says, "Lord, Lord, not everybody who
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.540]   calls on my name will enter the kingdom of God."
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:30.160]   And so I think it's really important that in the lightness of contemporary Christianity,
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:35.480]   I would like to remind us all to suffer a little bit more for the glory of God, such
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:43.600]   as helping out with childcare or joining, supporting SCP and whatnot.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.720]   The fourth thing is to study scriptures.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.080]   Let me see what these slides are.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.760]   Oh, all right, cool.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.320]   Give me one hot second.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:05.760]   So here in this passage, Paul is like, "Bro, you gotta study the word.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.200]   You need to rightly handle the word of truth.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.440]   Avoid irreverent babble.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.360]   Don't be like this guy, Philistus and Hymenaeus, who swore from the truth.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.520]   And you need to study the truth in order to not swear from it."
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.760]   I could tell all the elders the colors from whether they're the same or not, not because
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.940]   I'm smart, and it's not about getting it right for the first time.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.960]   It's about getting it right eventually.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.680]   And so the more you study something, then for sure you'll know it.
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.560]   And I think it's the same with the truth and the scripture.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:44.000]   And so as a teacher, I sometimes support students in preparing portfolios for boarding schools
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.600]   and college, and they study so hard for standardized testing.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:56.840]   They study as if their future depends on it, because we all know that our education attainment
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:02.920]   correlates with lifetime earnings, and this is still true for many of us.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:07.160]   And so I myself took the SATs six times, and I was terrible at it.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.000]   And God doesn't care how much you make.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.500]   He cares about our hearts.
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.700]   So we should study the Bible with the same amount rigor, if not more, than if we study
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:22.720]   the GMATs, the MCATs, the DSCs, the IGCSEs, the ACTs, the SATs, as if our lives depend
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.760]   on it, because our future actually does.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.580]   How we approach God's work, word, helps us determine how we spend eternity.
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.080]   And so we definitely should study it.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.940]   And I love this guy.
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.380]   I'm sure moms would be crazy about this guy.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.360]   Good looking guy, went to Oxford and Tsinghua.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.640]   Chan man right there, but who's in my clan?
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.640]   This is, this is, this is Tian Zhongshu.
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.400]   He writes this book, "Wei Xing," called "The Fortress."
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.640]   And there's this quote that just struck me so hard.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.400]   All my life, I've been wanting to give my parents bragging rights.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.440]   So getting into a good school was really important to me.
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.040]   But he says, oh, am I supposed to read it?
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.040]   Oh, shoot, it's English Congregation.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:24.920]   Jk. Basically, it says, "(speaking Chinese)." Thank you. "(speaking Chinese)" Clearly my Chinese is not very good.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   "(speaking Chinese)" Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.920]   We are, okay, for those who don't understand, I've Google translated it.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:47.520]   This diploma seems to have the function of the leaf of Adam and Eve's lower body,
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.820]   which can hide shame, ugliness, a small piece of paper can cover up a person's emptiness, ignorance, and stupidity.
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.620]   This comes from a guy who went to Oxford and Tsinghua.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:01.220]   And he says, yo, the academic diploma in Chinese society,
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:05.220]   we see it as that little leaf that covers Adam and Eve's loins.
[00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.420]   And I think it's so true.
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:18.220]   Harvard started in 1636 with the intention of establishing a school to train Christian ministers.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:23.220]   And I want to read you what the rules and precepts were in 1646.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.920]   Before I do, I'll tell you that this used to be the seal.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:32.320]   And it says, "Et Christos Ecclesia," which means "In Christ in the Church."
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.020]   And I think this is the Widener Library, maybe.
[00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.020]   And there used to be one book flipped down,
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:47.420]   which is trying to show you that symbolizes the limit of reason and the need for God's revelation.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:52.920]   But they've since changed the seal to like three books up and "Veritas."
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.320]   And it's like the most secular place you could ever be in.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.220]   And Harvard is now home to the marriage-wrecking MBA,
[00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:07.720]   according to the Financial Times, with the highest divorce rates amongst graduate school people.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.020]   But I'm going to read you what Harvard's rules and precepts are.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:17.120]   "Let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed to consider well.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.620]   The main end of his life and studies is to know God and Jesus Christ, which is eternal life."
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.820]   John 17, 3.
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:29.720]   "And therefore to lay Christ in the bottom as the only foundation of all sound knowledge and learning.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.220]   And seeing that the Lord only giveth wisdom,
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:37.120]   let everyone seriously set himself by prayer in secret to seek it of him."
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.220]   Proverbs 2, 3.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:43.520]   "Everyone shall so exercise himself in reading the scripture twice a day,
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:47.220]   and he shall be ready to give such an account of his proficiency therein,
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:50.320]   both in theoretical observations and language and logic,
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:55.120]   and in practical spiritual truth, as his tutor shall require according to his ability.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:00.720]   Seeing the entrance of the word giveth light, it giveth understanding to the simple."
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:10.320]   So that used to be, um, bummer, because I think they could have done more better or whatnot.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.820]   So for those who are like, "Oh, I wish God would speak to me.
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.520]   I don't know what God's will is for me.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.420]   Oh, man, I'm so lost.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.920]   I got to find myself."
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.820]   There's the Bible.
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:26.220]   I can buy you a copy if you don't have one.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:29.120]   Lit, we're at number five.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   Keep it clean.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:38.120]   He says, yeah, Paul gives this illustration of like these vessels, right?
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.320]   And vessels are super important back in the day, and it still is, right?
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.820]   You wouldn't drink from something that has a cockroach in it.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:46.020]   That would be nasty.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:50.820]   And so same with our bodies, same with our bodies.
[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:59.120]   We are, our bodies are our temples, for those who are familiar, right?
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:03.220]   That our bodies should be a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God,
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.520]   which is a place for worship, Romans chapter 12.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:11.120]   "Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's spirit dwells on you, in you?
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:17.520]   If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy you, for God's temple is holy and you are the temple."
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.820]   It's 1 Corinthians chapter 3.
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.720]   And so, oh, lit.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:32.020]   So C.S. Lewis gives this like incredible, it's like a quote that I'm about to butcher,
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.820]   but it's about like if you had glasses, do you have some glasses?
[00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.020]   Glasses, glasses, right?
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.620]   I usually wear glasses.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.420]   For your approval, I wore contacts, right?
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:51.620]   If we put, if we put lipstick on glasses, she's gonna do it, she's gonna do it, she's gonna do it.
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:30:00.720]   And, but, like, how are you, everything, everything you see through this is gonna be like so blurred.
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.420]   I can't work wearing these glasses.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:05.920]   And let me read you his quote.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.320]   Oh, I lost the quote, but basically, our bodies are like eyeglasses.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:12.820]   If we're not clean, then our vision of God would be blurred.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.320]   Amen, amen.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.020]   All right, let me put this away.
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.620]   Cool.
[00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:24.720]   Yeah, and then, of course, the other illustration is that I'm wearing like a white T-shirt, right?
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.020]   Like, we gotta keep things clean.
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:33.120]   And God gives us this like incredible strategy, right?
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.420]   He's like, bro, you gotta flee, don't fight.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.920]   Like, if I, let's say, Moe versus, T-shirt versus Sharpie, who's gonna win?
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.020]   Who's gonna win?
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.220]   Who's gonna win?
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.220]   We know this.
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:45.820]   We know this.
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:46.420]   Is she gonna do it?
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.020]   Is she gonna do it?
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:47.820]   Is she gonna do it?
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.520]   No, she's not.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.520]   'Cause I'm cheap.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:02.420]   And so, it's so important because when we get defiled, we are not ready for every good work.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.720]   We are a dishonorable vessel, and we can't be used by God.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.620]   God will not use you.
[00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.720]   God, in fact, will destroy you.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:18.620]   And so, yeah, don't put lipstick on your glasses and don't put Sharpies in your shirt.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:23.620]   And so, I love how God knows us so well.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.520]   He gives us two strategies, right?
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.120]   He knows that we are weak.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.120]   So, he's like, dude, don't even bother fighting it.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.520]   Just flee.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.620]   Just leave.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.720]   And then, the second thing is that he calls.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:40.020]   He asks us to be in community with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart, right?
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:43.220]   So, you gotta be in community with wholesome people.
[00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:45.720]   Like, first row are like my buddies, right?
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.320]   If I struggle, I'm just like calling on them, and they're wholesome people.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:56.420]   But if I just hang out with like weirdos who are like doing drugs all the time, then that ain't good.
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:01.720]   I'm just gonna be a weirdo who does drugs all the time, and that's not good.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.520]   And so, yes.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.720]   So, do that.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.520]   Flee, don't fight.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.520]   We don't have time for this slide.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.820]   Yeah, and you want to set yourself up for success.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:24.120]   Precisely when I was studying abroad in Jerusalem, there were a bunch of weirdos who like to do drugs at night and like whatever.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:29.020]   And study abroad, you know, it's a pretty few kids, right?
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:34.520]   You get like what, 10, 12 people in your class, and it's hard to like have wholesome people.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:39.120]   I don't think anybody was Christian in the group.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:43.720]   And so, it was really hard because people were like, "Oh my gosh, let's go to Tel Aviv."
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:50.220]   And Tel Aviv is like very liberal.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.520]   Let's just put it that way.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.720]   And it's the most liberal place you can find in the Middle East.
[00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:05.120]   And my friend Chris told me about this place, which is called Sakat Halal, and it's on number five, Ain Rogel Street.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.020]   And it's lit.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.120]   It's a 24-hour prayer house.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:13.520]   And every time that I'm just tempted to go to Tel Aviv and party with these people, I go here.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:18.620]   And it's great because it's open 24 hours, and it's beautiful, and there's always people praying.
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:22.120]   And so, you really want to set yourself up for success, right?
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:27.420]   If, I don't know, I used to love reading Murakami novels, Haruki Murakami.
[00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.520]   He's great.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:34.520]   And then he started writing something about like some super sexual weird thing, and I was like, "Bro, I can't read anymore."
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:35.920]   So, just don't read.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.220]   I switched to nonfiction.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.320]   It's fine.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.720]   Like, so, I think you need to set yourself up for success.
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:48.920]   Don't, like, I think Jesus summarizes it really well.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.920]   He says, "If your hand or foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you.
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:34:01.020]   It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than have two hands or feet and be casted into eternal fire."
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.120]   Matthew 18.8.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.520]   So, yeah, flee.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.420]   Don't fight.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.720]   Find some good buddies.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.520]   Finally, oh, we're doing great on time.
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.520]   Choose kind.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.520]   Choose kind.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.620]   I love being right for those who know me.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.420]   Like, I'm the most competitive person in games.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.620]   I get so salty when I lose.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:30.820]   I literally just can't handle, because I'm just so, like, my identity is so much tied up to, like, surpassing other people.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:36.620]   And so, that when I don't surpass people, like, I lost to my mom in arm wrestling and ping pong.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:38.720]   She's the blue person right there.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:40.320]   And it wounds my pride.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.420]   So, I call up my friend Chris.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.020]   I'm like, "Hey, do you know how to play ping pong?"
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.120]   And he's like, "No."
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.620]   And I'm like, "Great, let's play."
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.620]   And then I won.
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:51.920]   And that's how I sort of fill my self-esteem.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:55.520]   And, yeah.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:00.120]   So, right, this is super hard, right?
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.020]   I'm the most quarrelsome person I know.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.620]   And he's saying, like, the Lord's servant is not quarrelsome.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.220]   You must be kind to everyone.
[00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.420]   And that's so hard.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.820]   I can't even be kind to the people who are kind to me.
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.120]   It's just the hardest.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:20.320]   Able to teach, I do not accept constructive criticism.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.320]   Thank you.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   And, yeah.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.820]   And in face of evil, I just rage.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:33.120]   And on the chance that I get to correct opponents, I'm like, "It's payback time, baby."
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.420]   So, it's just, like, straight-up vengeance.
[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:40.120]   And my helper came today to support me.
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:45.120]   And she could testify how terrible of a person I am, just in my rage.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.920]   She's the receiver of most of my rage.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:55.120]   And so, if God can use a person like me, he definitely can use a people like you.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:03.520]   And so, just in closing, none of us, none of us, all right, just be nice.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.520]   Let's go back to this.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.720]   Sorry.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.020]   Sorry, I'm almost there.
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:19.220]   In closing, I want to say that none of us are able to achieve any of this apart from the Father,
[00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.820]   apart from constant prayer.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:27.220]   And I hope you see this chapter not necessarily as an instruction manual or a Christianized self-help theory,
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.920]   to-do list, BuzzFeed, blah, blah, blah.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:38.820]   But it's actually a wonderful gift of wisdom from God on how we ought to approach work in life.
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:45.520]   And so, yeah, so when you think about working for God, many of us think, go straight to, like, missionaries.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.520]   James, I don't know, John Snowgrove.
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.020]   But that's not biblical.
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.720]   The author of Timothy was a, Paul was a tentmaker.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.720]   Joseph, Jesus' father, was a carpenter.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.520]   Luke was a doctor.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.820]   Matthew was a tax collector.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.920]   Boaz was a farmer.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:02.020]   Uriah was a soldier.
[00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:03.420]   David was a shepherd musician.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.920]   And King Deborah is the only female judge in the Old Testament.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.320]   And then there's this guy called Truett Cathy, who's the founder of Chick-fil-A.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.520]   Anybody know the vision of Chick-fil-A?
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.520]   It's so lit.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.720]   I'm going to read it to you.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:16.720]   It's so lit.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:20.920]   The vision statement for Chick-fil-A, which is on their website right now, reads,
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:25.720]   "To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us,
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:31.120]   to have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A."
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.320]   So for those who are like, "I can't do this.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.020]   I work in a large corporate.
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.020]   Everybody's so pagan."
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.620]   Yo, you got no excuses because Chick-fil-A did it.
[00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:46.620]   So in closing, I want to rap for you guys if we have time.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:47.620]   Do we have time?
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.420]   Yes?
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.320]   Possibly?
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.520]   Okay, lit.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.420]   All right.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.420]   First, I need...
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.120]   Barbie, can you pass me that water?
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.720]   Oh, so lit.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.820]   Okay, okay.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:00.920]   This is going to be dope.
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:09.520]   And also to illustrate just the greatness of the one-finger bottle twist.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.120]   No, not.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.520]   The greatness of the collective.
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:19.220]   Why there is no such thing as a one-person church.
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.020]   I want to show you.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.620]   This is an app that I use to teach my students.
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.320]   But now I'm going to use it to teach you why the collective is great.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.620]   Oh my, I closed the...
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.120]   I closed it.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.620]   Barbie, I closed it.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.120]   Where is it?
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.320]   Screenshots.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.120]   Screenshots.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:39.920]   I got you.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.620]   I got you.
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:42.220]   Desktop.
[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.620]   Desktop.
[00:38:43.620 --> 00:38:45.220]   I'm so nervous.
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:46.920]   My heart's pounding.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.020]   It ain't working.
[00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:54.520]   Desktop.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.420]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.520]   Litty.
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:57.920]   Hell yeah.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.420]   Cool.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:04.020]   It's the devil.
[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.720]   I know, I know, I know.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.920]   Dude, I teach technology.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:10.220]   You're making me look so bad.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:14.920]   Some of my students are right here.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.920]   Sorry.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.720]   All right, we good, we good.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.220]   Okay.
[00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.220]   So, right.
[00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.420]   So, this is like the church.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.320]   So, we're going to throw on some beats.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.920]   Is there sound?
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.020]   Oh, there's no sound yet.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.520]   I'm going to make it sound.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.920]   Please, please have sound.
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.420]   Right, it's kind of boring.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.420]   But let's get this.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.220]   What?
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.220]   Right.
[00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:44.320]   Let me pick some.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.120]   Right.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.320]   So, this is like the church.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.320]   They all like, if we're just like alone, it's not going to be very good.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   So, I'm going to pick some folks.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.020]   All right, I'm going to get to it.
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.320]   Hold up, hold up.
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.320]   Hold up, hold up.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:03.820]   Ooh, look at that bass.
[00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.420]   Oh.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.320]   Hey.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.020]   Right.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.020]   Okay.
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:10.420]   Okay, it's happening.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.620]   It's happening.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:13.320]   Oh, man.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:14.520]   It's moving.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.920]   Okay.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:20.520]   So, it's a remix of 2 Timothy 2 that I wrote.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.920]   Hope you remember it.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.320]   And I wrote it to the, anybody know what these chords are to?
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.520]   It's actually to Tones and I's Dance Monkey.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.820]   So, I wrote it to that.
[00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:33.020]   All right, great.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.220]   Oh, lit.
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:41.120]   Wait, wait for it.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.920]   Hey.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:50.720]   Oh, my God, the world can't satisfy.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:58.120]   Take my life, my Lord, and make it multiply.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:04.520]   You know my heart, my passion, my desires.
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:11.520]   Now I beg you take the plank out of my eyes.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:18.320]   Oh, I know you love me, love me all the time.
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:25.620]   And oh my, you even call me your child.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:32.020]   You make me, make me, make me want to be holier.
[00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:39.720]   Now I try, now I try to make you proud.
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:45.520]   Timothy, Timothy, Timothy, don't you forget.
[00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:53.520]   You gotta fight like a soldier and run like a victor for the sake of the elect.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:59.820]   Timothy, Timothy, Timothy, don't you sweat.
[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:07.120]   I might die in this prison, but Jesus is risen from the dead.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.420]   To live, you gotta die. To live, you gotta die.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:14.120]   Seek first and find. Suffer and rise.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:21.020]   Flee desires and focus on the prize 'cause the prize is rooted in Jesus Christ.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.520]   Soak up his grace. It's okay to lose faith, to lose the right race.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.720]   It ain't about how much you make, the cars you chase, the wine you taste,
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.020]   or what's on your birthday cake.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.820]   It's about our holy father and his faith.
[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:34.320]   When we turned him away, he remained faithful and gave his only son to repay our godless days.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.120]   Instead of peace, love, and faith, we're filled with lust, lies, and shame,
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.520]   obsessing over ourselves instead of spending time to pray.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.420]   It could have been game over, but he gave us a chance to be holy forever
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:45.520]   and literally became the lamb that was slain.
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:49.120]   Hey, real talk. Jesus is the only way.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:54.820]   Oh, oh, hold up. Hold up.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.720]   Oh, we need this guy. Yeah.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.120]   What?
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:08.020]   Oh my god, the world can't satisfy.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:14.520]   Take my life, my lord, for it is yours, not mine.
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.120]   Let us pray, brothers.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:23.920]   Oh, oh, oh. Let us pray. Let's pray. Let us pray.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.920]   You wanna pray? I pray? I pray.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.720]   Okay, lit. I get to pray. That's great.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.420]   All right, clap for Jesus.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:36.520]   Lord, thank you so much for this time that I got to share to Timothy 2.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:42.420]   Thank you that you are a God, a boss that does have clear expectations.
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.620]   You've given us the word that you don't get mad
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.920]   because we don't understand your expectations,
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.720]   but you've clearly outlined it for us, Lord,
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:55.220]   that you've called us to make disciples, to train the trainers, Lord,
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:44:01.620]   that you've called us to study scripture, to endure, to enjoy, to suffer, Lord,
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:05.520]   to flee from desires and to be nice to everybody.
[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:08.320]   Father God, we love you. We thank you.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:14.820]   I just pray that just tonight that we would not only be hearers of the word, Lord,
[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:18.420]   that we would be doers of the word.
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.220]   For faith without works is dead.
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:27.920]   And so, Lord, I just pray that our works would make our faith perfect,
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:33.220]   as James, the real James, Bible James says.
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:37.120]   And we thank you, we love you in your precious name. Amen.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.620]   Litty.
