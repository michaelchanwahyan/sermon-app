[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.840]   Pastor Johnny is on his way back from Canada.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.960]   And with no flights from Canada to Hong Kong
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.000]   until at least March the 4th,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.920]   he has had to route via Abu Dhabi and now Thailand.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.120]   At least we have him in the same time zone.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.440]   Please pray for him.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.520]   But today's topic is Sabbath.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.640]   And you know, Hong Kong does not do this well.
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.560]   And I'll be honest, I do not do it well.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.200]   That's why I need to preach this message
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.480]   because I am the one who needs to hear it.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.960]   Pastor James touched on the gift of limits last week.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.440]   And I wanna talk about the one thing
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   that we all have a limitation on, which is time.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:16.480]   Time is the one thing we cannot make any more of.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.960]   You can't buy it, you can't sell it,
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.400]   you can't steal it, you can't trade it.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.240]   There are 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day,
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.160]   seven days in a week.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.400]   There will never be any more
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.360]   and there will never be any less.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.520]   Because of that, we all have a tenuous relationship
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.120]   with time.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.560]   I've mentioned already in this series,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.400]   you go up to someone in Hong Kong and you say,
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.440]   "How are you?"
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.960]   What do they say?
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.520]   "I'm busy."
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.400]   And we are busy at work.
[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   And technology has only made it worse.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.000]   We carry our office with us.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.880]   Oh man, I hate these WhatsApps, I get 1145 at night.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.520]   But also we're busy at play.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.120]   Do you remember dinners?
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.120]   Yeah, Hong Kong apparently has 15,000 plus restaurants
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.320]   and many of us seem keen or working to try them all out.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.640]   We can be so busy
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.680]   that we can lose our grip on life.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.160]   We can lose our grip on joy, on peace.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.040]   I don't know about you, I've actually appreciated
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.520]   this current quieter season.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   But you know, busyness does not equate
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.040]   to emotional health.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.120]   Busyness gets past our schedule
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.000]   and into our personal state.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Tonight, I'm gonna start a rebellion.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Yeah, a rebellion against the prevailing Hong Kong culture.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.480]   As Rafiki in "The Lion King" says,
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.480]   "It is time, enough is enough."
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.240]   And it all starts for us.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.160]   In Genesis one, in the story of creation,
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.360]   Bonnie read it for us beautifully, I might add.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.960]   She read this, "In the beginning,
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.280]   God created the heavens and the earth."
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   And then 30 verses later, "And God saw everything he'd made
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.960]   and behold, it was very good.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.960]   And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day."
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.000]   So there we have it, right?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.320]   God has worked hard for six days
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.160]   to create the heavens and the earth,
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.760]   light and dark, sun, moon, stars, land, plant, seas,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.600]   fish and birds, animals,
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.440]   and finally the pinnacle of his creation, humans.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.360]   But look at what comes next.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   Chapter two, "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.880]   and all the host of them.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.800]   And on the seventh day,
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.000]   God finished his work that he had done.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.440]   And he rested on the seventh day
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.520]   from all his work that he had done.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.640]   So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   because on it, God rested from all his work
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.840]   that he had done in creation."
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.120]   God rested.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.520]   Let that sink in.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.640]   God himself rested.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.560]   After six days of universe making work,
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.760]   God said, "That's enough."
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.160]   Now was God tired and needed a rest?
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.000]   Not at all.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   Actually, the Hebrew word for rested is Shabbat.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.040]   From where we get Sabbath from.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.240]   It means to rest, to cease, to be done.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.960]   It almost conjures a picture of kicking back
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.960]   and looking at what's been done and saying,
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.320]   "Hey, hey, that's not a bad job."
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.200]   I mean, that moon was pretty neat.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.960]   An alternative translation for Shabbat
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.000]   is to celebrate a day in the week that is set aside
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.400]   just to enjoy and to delight.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.800]   And that's the same for us.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   You see, God worked for six days and rested for one.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.960]   And in doing so,
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.960]   he built a rhythm into the fabric of creation.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.960]   As human beings who are created in God's image,
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.440]   remember that from Genesis 1,
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.680]   we work for six days like God
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:51.200]   and we rest for the seventh, just like God did.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.640]   Now notice two things in the story before we moved on.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.040]   I've put verse three on the screen.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.040]   Firstly, it says God blessed the seventh day.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.860]   God blessed the seventh day.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.860]   In Genesis 1 and 2, God blesses three things.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:18.440]   He blesses animals, humans, and the Sabbath.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:26.880]   Now he blessed animals and humans
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.320]   with a life-giving ability to procreate.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   Didn't he say, "Be fruitful, multiply and fill the earth."
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.840]   God blessed Adam and Eve.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.040]   Then a few verses later, we read,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.040]   "So God blessed the seventh day."
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.800]   What does that mean?
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.800]   It means that the Sabbath has a life-giving ability
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.560]   to fill the earth with more life.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.140]   Let's be honest, life is tiring.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:12.680]   Work no matter how much you love it, depletes your energy.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.360]   Rest on the other hand, refills you with life.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.200]   So yes, firstly, God blessed the seventh day.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.920]   And then we read, "And then he made it holy."
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:35.080]   Now you might've heard about the law of first mention.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.440]   It simply means that the very first time
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.920]   an important word or phrase is mentioned in Scripture
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.800]   is significant because the meaning behind
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   that first mention often establishes a precedent
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.800]   or a pattern that could be seen
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.720]   throughout the rest of the Bible.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.800]   The first mention almost always contains
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   the most complete and accurate meaning of the word.
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:05.280]   This not only serves as a key to understanding
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.480]   the word's biblical concept,
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   but it also provides a foundation for its fuller development
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.240]   in later parts of the Bible.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.080]   And the first time, the first time in Scripture
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.080]   you read the word holy is right here.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.000]   So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.400]   At the end of creating, God didn't build, make, inhabit
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.320]   a temple or a prayer mountain or a church or a cathedral.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   He made a day and he called it holy.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:57.240]   I love this quote by Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:04.360]   He said this, "The Sabbaths are our great cathedrals."
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:11.380]   The Sabbath stands as an invitation
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.660]   from the creator to creation to work for six days
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.220]   just like God did and to rest for the seventh
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.180]   just like God did.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:28.740]   When we don't do it, it can only lead
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.860]   to emotional unhealthiness, fatigue, lethargy,
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.660]   shutting down of our systems, feeling empty, disconnected.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.860]   These are the results of life without Sabbath,
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:48.820]   which is why God goes on to command the Sabbath.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:56.140]   If you could turn to Exodus 16,
[00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.900]   I'm gonna give you a picture.
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.740]   The Israelites are out in the desert.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.100]   They're grumbling against God.
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.580]   They were anything but emotionally healthy.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:10.620]   Let's read it.
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.380]   Then Moses said to Aaron,
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.260]   "Say to the whole congregation of the people of Israel,
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.100]   "come near before the Lord for he has heard your grumbling."
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.140]   And as soon as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.820]   of the people of Israel, they looked towards the wilderness
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:30.660]   and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.500]   And the Lord said to Moses,
[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.980]   "I've heard the grumbling of the people of Israel.
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.740]   "Say to them, at twilight, you shall eat meat.
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.420]   "And in the morning, you shall be filled with bread.
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:48.980]   "Then shall you know that I am the Lord your God."
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:54.020]   In the evening, quail come up, very nice, eh?
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:57.020]   You get it these days in Michelin star restaurants.
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.580]   In the evening, quail came up and covered the camp.
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:06.220]   And in the morning, dew lay around the camp.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.220]   And when the dew had gone up,
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.660]   there was on the face of the wilderness,
[00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:15.660]   a fine flake like thing, fine as the frost on the ground.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.340]   When the people of Israel saw it, they said to another,
[00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.460]   what is it?
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.180]   Now the word in Hebrew for what is it is actually manna.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.500]   So it's where they turned to each other and said, manna.
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.780]   For they did not know what it was.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.380]   And Moses said to them,
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.580]   "It is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat."
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:41.340]   Yes, the manna was the bread that God had given to eat.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.020]   And then we read from verse 21.
[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.300]   Morning by morning, they gathered it,
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.900]   ate as much as he could eat.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.260]   And when the sun grew hot, it melted.
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:57.380]   On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much bread,
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.100]   two omens each.
[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.500]   And when all the leaders of the congregation
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.500]   came and told Moses, he said to them,
[00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.700]   this is what the Lord commanded.
[00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:10.860]   Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest,
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.260]   a holy Sabbath to the Lord.
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:20.460]   Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest,
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.100]   a day of Sabbath to the Lord.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.020]   Now notice these words.
[00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.620]   Sabbath and holy.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:36.180]   Sabbath is 100% linked with worship.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:41.340]   Sabbath is more than just a day off.
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:48.180]   The questions we should ask ourselves
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.300]   of our Sabbath are these.
[00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.780]   Do I rest?
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.700]   And do I worship?
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:58.860]   Let's look at the next verse.
[00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.580]   This is getting quite interesting.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.180]   He said, "Bake what you will bake
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:03.980]   and boil what you will boil,
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.740]   and all that is left over,
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.860]   lay aside to be kept to the morning."
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:13.300]   Now what this speaks about is preparing for a Sabbath.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:17.180]   And with it for us, a challenge
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.140]   to actually get ready to rest
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.660]   and to get ready for worship.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.140]   The apostle John called it a preparation day.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.340]   Let's read on.
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:32.340]   I'm enjoying this.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.580]   So they laid it aside till morning
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:36.580]   as Moses commanded them,
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.380]   and it did not stink for there were no worms in it.
[00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.420]   Praise God for that.
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.020]   And Moses said, "Eat it today,
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:47.460]   for today is a Sabbath to the Lord.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.900]   Today you will not find it in the field.
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.220]   Six days you shall gather it,
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.300]   but on the seventh day, which is a Sabbath,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:57.300]   there will be none."
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.620]   On the seventh day, some of the people,
[00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.780]   they didn't take notice.
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.740]   They went out to gather some, but they found none.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.300]   And the Lord said to Moses,
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.620]   "How long?
[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:12.700]   How long will you refuse to keep my commandments
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:14.060]   and my laws?
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.100]   See, the Lord has given you the Sabbath.
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.180]   Therefore, on the sixth day,
[00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.340]   he gives you bread for two days.
[00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.180]   Remain each of you in his place."
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.060]   Old Testament lockdown.
[00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.620]   Let no one go out of his place on the seventh day.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:39.700]   So the people rested on the seventh day.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.580]   I wanna just highlight here this expression.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.860]   And the Lord said to Moses,
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.540]   "How long will you refuse to keep my commandments
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.580]   and my laws?
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:54.980]   See, the Lord has given you the Sabbath."
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:16:00.260]   Yes, the Sabbath is a command,
[00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:05.700]   but it is also a gift.
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:09.060]   Now I know what you're thinking.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.100]   Pastor John, that's the Old Testament.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.780]   Yeah, I know it's in the 10 commandments
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.020]   in Exodus 20,
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.700]   but I don't read very much about the commandment
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.860]   to Sabbath in the New Testament.
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:28.900]   It is indeed one of the 10 commandments.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.260]   Interestingly, the one that has the most words
[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.420]   than the other nine.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:37.820]   But you would be right.
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:42.780]   There is no command to Sabbath in the New Testament.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.620]   Listen carefully.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.620]   You don't have to Sabbath,
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:59.300]   but it still stands as a gift from God.
[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.940]   Look, there's no commandment to sleep eight hours a night,
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.460]   but if you wanna be emotionally healthy,
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.300]   burning the candles at both ends
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.420]   will not lead to emotional health.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.260]   The point I'm trying to make is this.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.460]   The Sabbath is a gift from God.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:22.540]   But as mankind, we have repeatedly spurned this gift
[00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.300]   over the past thousand years ago.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.820]   We think we know best.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.100]   We know how to work.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.620]   We know how to play,
[00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:39.780]   but we do not know how to worship.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.420]   We do not know how to Sabbath,
[00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:51.700]   even, or should I say, especially in the church.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:57.900]   And the reason for this is partially down to a misread
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.940]   of something that Jesus said in his life.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.140]   It's found in Mark chapter two.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.100]   Now in the gospels, the Sabbath seems to be a day
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.980]   for Jesus to get himself into trouble.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.860]   Just read the gospels.
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.660]   You can see this time and time again.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.060]   There was a reason for this.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.260]   Mark 2, 23, "One Sabbath,
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.140]   he was going through the grain fields.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.460]   And as they made their way,
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.020]   his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:25.740]   And the Pharisees were saying to him,
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.740]   'Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?'"
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.900]   You see what happened?
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.260]   The Pharisees had added so much to the law
[00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.060]   so that something that started out as good
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:41.860]   and the law was good,
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.740]   became a rod because of a hundreds of rules.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:49.260]   The law had said, "You shall not work on the Sabbath."
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:50.820]   The Pharisees had taken it
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.500]   to mean you should not snack on a sweet corn.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.820]   So Jesus replied, this verse is important.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:04.940]   "And he said to him, 'The Sabbath was made for man,
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.940]   not man for the Sabbath.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:12.940]   So the Son of Man is Lord, even of the Sabbath.'"
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.140]   This is an important verse.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:21.140]   Jesus said, "Man wasn't created for the Sabbath."
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:25.980]   And the Pharisees needed to hear the second part of the verse.
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:30.180]   "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for Sabbath."
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:35.380]   But we are not Pharisees.
[00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:37.780]   I hope.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:44.180]   But as I look at that verse again, in the light of 2022,
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:52.020]   21st century society needs to hear clearly
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.740]   these words again.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.580]   "The Sabbath was made for man."
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:04.820]   "The Sabbath was made for man."
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:08.140]   We have the opposite problem to the Pharisees.
[00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:11.180]   It's not that we have a hundreds of rules about the Sabbath,
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.020]   we have none.
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:18.460]   To be honest, most of us don't even take a Sabbath.
[00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:25.260]   Now let's read over the page into chapter three.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.500]   And as I said earlier, Sabbath seemed to be the time
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.820]   for Jesus to get himself into trouble
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.220]   with the religious authorities.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.460]   Look at this.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.100]   Again, he entered the synagogue
[00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.940]   and a man was there with a withered hand.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.860]   And they watched Jesus to see whether he would heal
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.140]   on the Sabbath so they might accuse him.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:48.380]   And he said to the man with the withered hand, "Come here."
[00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.420]   And he said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath
[00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:58.420]   to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?"
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.300]   But they were silent.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.060]   As he looked around at them with anger,
[00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:11.260]   grieved at their hardness of heart,
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.620]   he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:18.780]   And his hand was restored.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:24.220]   The Pharisees, true to form, went out
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:29.220]   and immediately held council with the Herodians against him,
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.220]   how to destroy him.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.460]   Look again at the Gospels, read the Gospels.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.580]   When do most of Jesus' healings take place?
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:44.140]   Yes, the Sabbath.
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.500]   Is that a coincidence?
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.340]   I don't think so.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:54.460]   I believe that Jesus saw the Sabbath as a day for healing.
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.940]   We would do well to bear that in mind.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.500]   Look, all I'm saying at this point is this.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.460]   My friends, take a Sabbath.
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:16.580]   When, where, how, whatever works for you.
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:25.500]   But take a Sabbath.
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.220]   I'm gonna spend the rest of my time on a personal testimony.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.260]   I said at the beginning,
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.700]   "I'm not there yet, this sermon is for me."
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:39.500]   And I certainly wasn't there 20 years ago.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.300]   I was a general manager of an insurance company
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:46.060]   and helping to run a small but growing church
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:48.020]   as an elder and a preacher.
[00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.420]   Pretty flat out, I'm afraid.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:55.420]   If I would say, "I'm busy," it was a reply,
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.020]   if you asked me how I was.
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.380]   Then I became a full-time pastor.
[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:06.060]   This was my opportunity.
[00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.860]   Mondays became my Sabbaths.
[00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.540]   To be honest, I was often so worn out
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.380]   after ministering on Sundays.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.660]   And I was really quite good.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.540]   Mondays, I was uncontactable.
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:24.140]   I would even turn down lunches
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.460]   from famous speakers who'd come to Hong Kong
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.780]   'cause quite often they'd minister in Hong Kong
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.380]   on the weekend and then do a lunch on Monday.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.940]   I still get calls from people who would say,
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.100]   "I know it's your day off, but."
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.180]   So I started first by muting the phone
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.020]   and then turning it off.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:49.860]   I thought I was doing well
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.540]   until the 7th of June, 2019,
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.860]   the day that changed my life.
[00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:07.900]   I was in Israel in a place called Haifa
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.100]   as part of the team from KFCI.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:16.020]   It was our first Friday, our first Shabbat.
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:18.740]   We knew things were gonna be slightly different
[00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.620]   when instead of pressing the button on the elevator,
[00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.900]   which apparently is classified as work,
[00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.180]   the elevator stops at every floor.
[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.980]   The dining room at the Leonardo Plaza Hotel
[00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.180]   was set out differently that night.
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.700]   It was organised just for family groups
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:38.980]   and we were one of them.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.860]   Then I met this wonderful guy in the picture.
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.700]   Sorry about my shirt, by the way. (laughs)
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.260]   He invited me to meet his family
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.460]   and they invited our group to join them
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:57.300]   and be part of their family for the Shabbat celebrations.
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:02.940]   Here he is with his son and part of our group.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:06.340]   It's hard to describe the warmth, the love,
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:11.340]   the acceptance we received as we celebrated Shabbat together.
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:15.740]   We prayed blessings over each other
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.260]   and we took unleavened bread and wine together.
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:24.860]   We were so filled that when the family went,
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.820]   we took communion together, there's a picture here,
[00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.980]   to celebrate what we had experienced.
[00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.300]   And we did it again the following week,
[00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.700]   this time in Jerusalem.
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.740]   But what did I learn from Israel?
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.340]   It seemed to me a little bit like what we experience here
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.140]   with families during Chinese New Year, but every week.
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:51.020]   It's like doing Chinese New Year every Friday.
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:57.140]   I learned in Haifa that my Mondays, good as they were,
[00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:02.980]   had in reality been a day off rather than a Sabbath.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:11.940]   I learned in Haifa that Sabbath was more than a day off.
[00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.500]   I found out in Haifa four elements
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:23.180]   that go up to making a Sabbath, Sabbath.
[00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.980]   I've put them on the screen.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:31.940]   Sabbath equals stopping and resting
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:37.460]   and delighting and worship.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.620]   I'll say that again, this is important.
[00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.620]   Sabbath is stopping and resting and delighting and worship.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:53.300]   As I finish, may I just look briefly at each one.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.380]   Firstly, stopping.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:00.540]   We're invited to stop working,
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.700]   to stop thinking about working,
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.100]   to stop worrying, to stop wanting.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.900]   The act of stopping means we trust in God.
[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:18.940]   Resting, we're invited to both physical
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.700]   and emotional rest on the Sabbath.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:27.540]   On this day, we release the illusion of control to God
[00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.860]   and know that he will keep us
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:34.740]   in the midst of the unfinished work.
[00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.100]   Rather like those Israels with the bread.
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:43.580]   Delighting, we are invited to a kind of resting
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.620]   that is a feast, a party and our celebration.
[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.620]   Sabbath is all about creating space for delight.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:53.780]   John Mark Comer says,
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:57.700]   "Sabbath is a day to feed our soul with beauty,
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.580]   "to rewire the pathways of our brain,
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.140]   "to rejoice in the Lord always."
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.780]   And lastly, worshipping.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.460]   When we stop to rest and delight,
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.100]   it leads us to worship God.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.580]   We find ourselves thanking God.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:23.940]   Sabbath gives us a chance to be human again,
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:29.260]   to get our souls back again,
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.460]   to become emotionally healthy.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.180]   I've no idea what it looks like for you.
[00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.460]   What constitutes rest and worship for you
[00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:44.020]   may be very different for what constitutes rest
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.340]   and worship for me.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:52.060]   But what I do want to do is to encourage you to Sabbath.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:56.620]   Reshape your life from top to bottom.
[00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:02.660]   And together, we can reshape our church
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.180]   and indeed our city.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.900]   It is a pathway to emotional health,
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.700]   a pathway to life in God's present,
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.580]   a relief from busy, busy, busy, busy.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:22.540]   And at the same time, discover life.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.580]   Discover a God who made the universe
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.900]   as a place to be with these people
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.460]   and a place for us to be without God.
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.500]   As Brother Lawrence says,
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.220]   to practise the presence of God.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.300]   Walter Brueggemann, widely considered
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:44.100]   one of the most influential scholars
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.500]   of the last several decades said this,
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:52.460]   "People who keep Sabbath live all seven days differently."
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:56.060]   Can I say it again?
[00:29:57.260 --> 00:30:02.260]   People who keep Sabbath live all seven days differently.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:13.140]   My friend, it is not just 24 hours at the end of a week.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:18.220]   It is a way of life.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.980]   It is a way to live in God's presence all week long.
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:30.180]   When we Sabbath well, we stay in that spirit all week long.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.620]   Even as we work, as we labour, we toil, we contend.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:40.220]   That is what I want for you.
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:45.780]   My church family, my friends.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:51.660]   Make a decision today
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.020]   to make this part of your life.
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:04.700]   My friends, there is a day that is blessed and holy.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.940]   There is rhythm in your body and soul.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.540]   There's rhythm in the universe.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.300]   They're into place, work and rest.
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.940]   Maybe you are being called today, I know I am,
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:23.620]   to slow your life down,
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.140]   to tune into that rhythm.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:32.100]   Maybe you have to change your lifestyle.
[00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.900]   I have a word of comfort for you.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:43.860]   God is waiting for you there.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:49.100]   I'm gonna ask James to come back
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.900]   and we're gonna sing a rather special song.
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.660]   We're gonna sing this song, Still.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:57.660]   I wanna invite you wherever you are,
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.340]   if you're a computer at home
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.620]   and you're looking on the other screen
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:05.340]   or you're checking emails or sports results or anything,
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:08.660]   to put down everything you're doing.
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:13.900]   I'm gonna pray and we're gonna sing that song together.
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:20.020]   I will be still and know that you are God.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.100]   You are God.
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:26.540]   That's our prayer as a church, surely,
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:33.380]   that we will be still and know that he is God.
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.500]   Let's pray.
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:41.260]   Father, I pray that you would calm the raging storm.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:49.500]   Lord, when we read the newspaper headlines daily,
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.460]   there's so much going on in our world, in our city.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:33:01.260]   I pray you'll give us time now just to focus on you.
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.620]   And Lord, that your spirit would speak to our spirit
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.660]   about the changes we need to make in our lives,
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.540]   in our church, in our city,
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:17.020]   to learn to do Sabbath.
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.860]   We thank you, Lord, you have a plan
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.300]   and a purpose for each one of us.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.380]   You have a plan and a purpose for this church.
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:29.380]   Your hand is upon Hong Kong.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.980]   Use this time tonight
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:40.020]   where the storms of life are raging
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:45.140]   to give us that peace in our heart tonight.
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.540]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.040]   (piano music)
