00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,720
 Last week I shared from the book of Ecclesiastes chapter 7, this preacher, this Kohelet, gatherer

2
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:21,360
 of wisdom, maybe Solomon himself, he starts dropping some wisdom, applications on how

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,760
 to live in this complicated world.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,560
 He says there's so many things that he's seen.

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,120
 There is nothing new under the sun, everything is meaningless, but ultimately this is what

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,120
 you should do.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,960
 Have a right perspective on life and death.

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,080
 Have a right perspective on prosperity and adversity.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,360
 And one of the bits in this chapter 7 is him talking about, hey, look, I've seen that righteous

10
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,960
 people and wicked people, their lives in terms of what they end up having to experience is

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,920
 really not all that different.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,480
 The wicked people, the unrighteous ones, they seem to get goodies too.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,400
 The sun seems to shine on them and the righteous people who are trying everything to be as

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,280
 best as they can, they still have rain fall on them.

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,220
 And so he's talking about this and in chapter 8 he moves into really attacking or addressing

16
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,640
 this issue even more.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,080
 And the title of this evening's topic is, What About the Wicked?

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,180
 As we look around at the world right now, as we see the news, there is no shortage of

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,180
 bad news.

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,640
 There is no shortage of hearing about bad people.

21
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:31,920
 Even this last week we heard, of course, from the country where I came from, Her Majesty

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,400
 the Queen passes away and there's so much that's flooding in terms of all the good things

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,920
 about her, everything that she stood for, everything that she stood for that was to

24
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,360
 be admired, but yet there's always this other side that there are people who talk about

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,600
 different things when it comes to the British Empire and everything that's happened in history

26
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,360
 and you can't ignore that.

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,540
 And there's all these different pieces of news as we look on the channels and we see

28
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,920
 just bad things after bad things and we see people killing each other, people hurting

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,320
 each other, people being selfish, people being greedy.

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,160
 And then you might ask yourself, God, what about those people?

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,200
 What about those people who are simply out to hurt others?

32
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,440
 Why don't you stop them?

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,960
 That's what Kohala, that's what the preacher here is saying.

34
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,040
 He's looking around at everything and he's going, why are these people still around?

35
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,520
 Chapter 8, verse 8 to 9 has this, "No man has power to retain the spirit or power over

36
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
 the day of death.

37
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,440
 There is no discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it.

38
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,800
 All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun when man

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,600
 had power over man to his hurt."

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,840
 Now it's not easy to read, it's not easy to understand, but what he's saying here is,

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,980
 I've seen so much.

42
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:52,720
 We don't have any control over the wind, we don't have any control over death, and actually

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,160
 people seem so intent on hurting each other.

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,200
 And it is just the way it is, is what he's saying.

45
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,000
 And then he goes on further, and we're only going to focus on a few verses here from 10

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,600
 to 15, and he carries on.

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
 Then he says this, "Then I saw the wicked buried."

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
 Those bad people.

49
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,820
 Those bad people.

50
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,780
 "I started seeing them die.

51
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,460
 They used to go in and out of the holy place and were praised in the city where they had

52
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,620
 done such things.

53
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,680
 This also is vanity, because the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily,

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,060
 the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil."

55
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,860
 He's saying, I've seen wicked people, I've seen them die, and I've seen them get away

56
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
 with it.

57
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,620
 And when they get away with it, they keep going.

58
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,620
 That's what he's saying.

59
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,500
 "Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life, yeah, I know that it

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,240
 will be well with those who fear God, because they fear before him.

61
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,860
 But it will not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like a shadow, because

62
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,660
 he does not fear before God."

63
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,100
 He's saying he's seen evil, he's seen sinners do evil things, and yet it prolongs their

64
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,100
 life.

65
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
 They've been able to live long lives.

66
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,260
 "But ultimately I know, ultimately I know that it will not be well for them, or at the

67
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,340
 very least it will be well for those who fear God.

68
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,100
 And finally, there is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people

69
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,220
 to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people

70
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,500
 to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous.

71
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,260
 I said that this is also vanity.

72
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,060
 And I commend joy, for man has nothing better under the sun, but to eat and drink and be

73
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,780
 joyful, for this will go with him in his tour through the days of his life that God has

74
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,220
 given him under the sun."

75
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,700
 This is the word of the Lord, albeit hard to understand.

76
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:38,540
 I shared with you last week that I found Ecclesiastes so complex, so confusing often.

77
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,900
 You've got this preacher who's filled with wisdom, he's gathered all this wisdom, and

78
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,900
 yet he seems just as confused as us.

79
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,580
 And of course, some people really do love this book.

80
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,940
 Actually, as I was looking at it, as I was preparing the sermons, I was like, "Man, Ecclesiastes

81
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,460
 is so tricky, so challenging, so hard to understand."

82
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,620
 And then I turn over and talk to my wife, and she's like, "It's my favourite book."

83
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,980
 And then I realise, "Oh, so that's why I've struggled to understand you, because this

84
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,540
 is what it looks like."

85
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,580
 And you see there's no difference.

86
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,500
 And yet, I think the preacher is trying to say something to us.

87
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,420
 Kohele is trying to explain something to us, which is this.

88
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,580
 Your knowledge and your understanding of this world is limited.

89
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,820
 As much as you want to be wise, you're still not going to truly get it.

90
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,020
 And this passage here, he's venting, actually.

91
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,660
 He's talking about the wicked.

92
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,660
 One, they exist, not good.

93
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,720
 Two, they don't get punished, bad.

94
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,380
 When they don't get punished, they keep going.

95
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,540
 Not good at all, not fair.

96
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,540
 And so what do we do?

97
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,500
 This is essentially what he's saying.

98
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,420
 Someone kind of brings this a little bit down to earth and writes this quote about this

99
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,660
 passage that may relate to us.

100
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,740
 He says, "Cruel dictators drive out free governments.

101
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,260
 The man who robs investors of their inheritance gets a huge bonus, while hardworking people

102
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,100
 lose their jobs and their homes.

103
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,260
 Suffering pastors are put in prison, while the persecutors of the church grow strong

104
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,700
 in their cruel power.

105
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,660
 To bring things down to the personal level, the student who gets cheated on a difficult

106
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,820
 exam gets an A, but all you get is a C-.

107
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,220
 The worker who stabbed you in the back gets the promotion, while you remain stuck at the

108
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,220
 same pay grade.

109
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,160
 Or you make a commitment to chastity, and although you are still single, the girl who

110
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,460
 throws herself at men gets a ring on her finger and a long white dress.

111
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,100
 Something doesn't seem right.

112
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,820
 Something is off.

113
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,220
 It just isn't fair.

114
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,960
 God, where are you?

115
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,060
 What are you doing?"

116
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,540
 Have we asked those questions before?

117
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,220
 Have we looked at the news and seen people who are in charge of big, big countries, who

118
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:46,180
 are maybe not looking after their own people well, or maybe attacking other people, hurting

119
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,700
 other people, and we think, "God, why don't you come and just zap them?

120
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,740
 Zap them, just lightning.

121
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,580
 Just remove them from the earth so they can stop hurting people."

122
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,900
 Have you ever thought that?

123
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,760
 I think Kohelet has been thinking that.

124
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,440
 He's going, "What do we do?

125
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,960
 The wickedness surrounding us, what do we do?"

126
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,440
 As I was thinking that, and I was joining him in the venting, and I was like, "Yeah!

127
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,800
 These people should be killed.

128
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,800
 They shouldn't have a chance.

129
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
 They shouldn't have a second chance.

130
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
 They should be wiped out.

131
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,720
 Wouldn't the world be so much better with him, him, him, her, her, or be disappeared,

132
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
 removed from the earth?

133
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,000
 Wouldn't that be better?

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,680
 God, where are you?

135
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
 What are you doing?"

136
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,400
 As I was reflecting on that, I think I was really challenged by a few things.

137
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,640
 There were some things about my perspective that was wrong when it comes to the wicked.

138
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,160
 When I asked that question, "God, what about those guys?

139
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,800
 God, what about them?

140
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,320
 Why aren't you dealing with them?"

141
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,800
 It really challenged me on a couple of things.

142
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,160
 There are three questions that came up in my mind that I'd love to share with you today.

143
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,160
 The first question is this, "Who do we actually see as wicked?

144
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
 What is wicked?"

145
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,360
 Of course, how many have seen the theater show Wicked?

146
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,680
 It's really good.

147
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,640
 It is incredibly good.

148
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
 It's interesting.

149
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,680
 It tells a very powerful story that I won't spoil it for those who, please, do go see

150
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
 it.

151
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,440
 The question is, "What is wicked to you?

152
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,400
 What's your definition as wicked?"

153
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,220
 As you look at someone, what threshold do you have?

154
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,760
 What ticks do you need to go through before you go, "Okay, that person is wicked."

155
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
 What is wicked?

156
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,120
 What is evil to you?

157
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,760
 When I just said that word, "evil," what comes up in your mind?

158
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,000
 What's evil?

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 What are the things that are evil to you?

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,280
 Did God create evil?

161
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,280
 Did God create evil?

162
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,440
 The truth is, no, because God created everything.

163
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,280
 What did He call everything when He created it?

164
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,400
 He said, "It is good."

165
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,960
 So evil really isn't a thing.

166
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,600
 It's just like darkness and light.

167
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,720
 Darkness isn't really anything.

168
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,840
 Darkness is simply the absence of light.

169
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
 Darkness itself isn't a thing.

170
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,560
 It's simply that there is no light around there.

171
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,760
 So evil, in the same way, isn't really a thing.

172
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,400
 It is simply just something that has been corrupted, something that has been twisted.

173
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,480
 Augustine and C.S. Lewis, Clive Staple Lewis, both say this.

174
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,320
 Evil, wickedness, is basically the corruption of a good thing.

175
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
 That's what it is.

176
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,280
 God created this world and He called it good, yet for us, we have corrupted it.

177
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
 That's what we did.

178
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,880
 There's this famous book by C.S. Lewis, a couple that I'm going to quote today, because

179
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,000
 actually this topic, "God, why is there suffering if you are really that powerful, if you are

180
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 really that loving?"

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,080
 C.S. Lewis, being a very intelligent man, before he was a Christian, would go to all

182
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,320
 his academic friends in Oxford and Cambridge and challenge them on this.

183
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,920
 If your God is all loving and if your God is all knowing, then why is there still such

184
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
 suffering and evil in the world?

185
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,240
 It's the Epicurean paradox.

186
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,000
 It's a Greek philosophy paradox, which is, wait, if He is God and He is all loving and

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,800
 He is all knowing, then why is there still so much rubbish that is happening?

188
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,600
 Surely that means He is incompetent or disinterested, right?

189
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,600
 That's the paradox.

190
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,160
 And C.S. Lewis would keep asking his Christian friends this until he finally found the answer.

191
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,320
 And I'll let him explain it more to you, but before that, he writes this book called "The

192
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
 Screwtape Letters."

193
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,440
 It's a very interesting book and it's a satirical novel, okay?

194
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,880
 So it's not actually happening.

195
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,200
 He doesn't have any specific divine revelation on this is happening, but "The Screwtape Letters"

196
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,480
 is about Screwtape, who is a senior demon.

197
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,520
 He's a senior demon and he's writing letters to one of his young demons, trying to train

198
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
 his young demon.

199
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,120
 What's he trying to train him to do?

200
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,360
 He's trying to train him how to distract humans from God.

201
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,560
 So that's the book, that's what it's all about.

202
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,400
 So Screwtape writes him these letters.

203
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,040
 And there's this one passage which I thought I must read to you because it is really interesting.

204
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,880
 So Screwtape here is the senior demon and he's writing to his understudy and he says

205
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
 this.

206
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
 He said, "You know what?

207
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,960
 God is a hedonist at heart.

208
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,540
 He makes no secret of it.

209
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,160
 At his right hand are pleasures forevermore.

210
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
 He's vulgar, Wormwood."

211
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,400
 Wormwood is his understudy.

212
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
 He's vulgar.

213
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,320
 "He has a bourgeois mind.

214
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,880
 He has filled his world full of pleasures.

215
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,000
 There are things for humans to do all day long.

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,680
 Sleeping, and washing, and eating, and drinking, and making love, playing, praying, working.

217
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,180
 Everything has to be twisted before it's any use to us."

218
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,480
 Everything has to be twisted before it's any use to us.

219
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,400
 God did not create evil.

220
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,640
 There is no such thing as evil.

221
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,520
 There is simply good things that have been twisted.

222
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,600
 Good things that have been corrupted.

223
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,560
 It's a good world that's gone wrong.

224
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,320
 Fire is a good thing.

225
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,760
 It keeps us warm.

226
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,960
 It helps us cook our food so we don't have salmonella.

227
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,740
 But if used wrongly, it can be used for explosives to kill people.

228
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,680
 Water is an essential ingredient of life.

229
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
 We need water to survive.

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,920
 And water can also be used to drown someone.

231
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,600
 Evil simply is the corruption of a good thing.

232
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,880
 Evil is the corruption of a good thing.

233
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,040
 And when did it start?

234
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,080
 When did evil enter?

235
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,160
 The moment in the garden with Adam and Eve.

236
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,200
 The fall.

237
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,760
 If good, if everything is good because we choose God, we follow what God is asking us

238
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,960
 to do, we use the things that God has designed them for, then we're good.

239
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,000
 But the moment we choose something else, the moment we choose to use it for our own desires,

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,320
 then it becomes evil, it becomes sin.

241
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,600
 And that's what Adam and Eve did.

242
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,040
 God said, "Here it is.

243
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
 This is the garden.

244
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,040
 This is your creation.

245
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,480
 You can live in my presence for eternity and you can enjoy all of this."

246
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,120
 But then they chose a different way.

247
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,880
 And so at that point, wickedness enters in.

248
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,000
 God had designed the garden, had designed Adam and Eve to live forever.

249
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,820
 But unfortunately, they chose another way.

250
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,840
 Just like we choose another way.

251
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,200
 So the question really is this, as we challenge ourselves to think, "What is really evil?

252
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,840
 What's actually wicked?"

253
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,080
 The first thing we have to realise is actually, we have it within us.

254
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
 We have it in us.

255
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,160
 Before we start labelling, "Oh, that person is wicked.

256
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,600
 That person is evil."

257
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
 There is no such thing.

258
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,120
 If there is no such thing as wicked, then there is only such a thing as a person choosing

259
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,000
 to carry out evil deeds.

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,600
 There is only a person who is choosing to do this, choosing to be wicked.

261
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,040
 But there are no inherently wicked people in that sense.

262
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,120
 Which also means that actually, that has a repercussion for all of us.

263
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,720
 The Apostle Paul in Romans 3 says this.

264
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,280
 He says, "There's no distinction.

265
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,720
 You looking over there, pointing down at that person.

266
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,200
 There is no distinction.

267
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,080
 We all fall short of the glory of God.

268
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
 All of us.

269
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,620
 There is wickedness in all of us."

270
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,000
 So before we point that finger and say, "That person is wicked."

271
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,240
 I mean that cheesy thing is, every time you point a finger out, there's three fingers

272
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,320
 pointing back at you.

273
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,360
 As believers, as we are surrounded by a world that is filled with wickedness, we have to

274
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,760
 remember that we cannot put that wickedness onto these people as that is their whole thing.

275
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,280
 That is their whole being.

276
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,320
 They are simply people that were designed for good, who have chosen otherwise.

277
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,920
 And then we realise, "Oh actually, that's me as well.

278
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,200
 There seems to be different levels of it, but actually there is wickedness in me."

279
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,280
 We first must look at ourselves.

280
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,680
 Be careful that we don't have an inflated view of ourselves.

281
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,040
 Jesus talks about this.

282
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,060
 You keep looking over at your friend and saying, "There's a piece of dust in your eye when

283
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,040
 you ignore the fact that there's a plank in my eye."

284
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,040
 So as I look at the news and I see all these bad, all these wicked people, I realise, "Goodness

285
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,240
 me, I think I need to change the way I look at this."

286
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,680
 Now it's not denying that there are evil acts that are being carried out, that there is

287
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,880
 wickedness in the world, but first I need to check, "Is there wickedness in me?"

288
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,840
 First I must see if there is any evil in me because there is simply no distinction.

289
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:20,360
 We are truly all wicked in the sense that we carry out, we choose to do wicked acts.

290
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,520
 Then the second question is this.

291
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,400
 If I've decided that, okay, what wicked is, the second question I ask myself is, "Well,

292
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,280
 what do I think they deserve?"

293
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:34,280
 Kohelet here is saying they are not getting punished and because of that their behaviour

294
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,360
 is carrying on.

295
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,800
 There is delayed punishment or even worse, there is no punishment at all.

296
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
 What are we going to do with this?

297
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,240
 A commentator summarised this bit and this is one of the trickiest texts in this chapter

298
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
 and in the Bible.

299
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,680
 And he summarises this.

300
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,040
 What the preacher is trying to say here is there is no moral purpose working itself out

301
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
 in human destiny.

302
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,520
 Do you know we always have these things where when we do something good then we will get

303
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,920
 rewarded, we will have a better life.

304
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,680
 When we do something bad, something will happen and we will get punished.

305
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,560
 Ecclesiastes is saying there is no moral purpose working itself out in human destiny.

306
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,360
 Everything just happens.

307
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,160
 And the preacher, the author here, is very frustrated with that because he sees wicked

308
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,800
 people that he is looking down on and he is waiting for them and asking, "Why are they

309
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,280
 not being punished?

310
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,800
 Why does God spare immediate judgement?"

311
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
 The problem here is this.

312
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,360
 Once we have discerned that actually there is no actual wickedness, there is simply just

313
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,360
 good people who are choosing to do wicked acts, we will start to understand why God

314
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,000
 doesn't give out immediate judgement.

315
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,920
 If God did give immediate judgement, none of us would be here.

316
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,680
 Because the moment we would do something small that is wrong, that is still wrong, we would

317
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
 be zapped.

318
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,680
 We would be gone.

319
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,960
 And we wouldn't even have a chance to do that because the moment Eve takes a bite from the

320
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,840
 apple and Adam takes a bite from the apple, Eve would be enough to wipe out the human

321
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,400
 race because then they wouldn't be able to reproduce.

322
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,680
 God zaps her away, then there is only Adam left.

323
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
 He is lonely.

324
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,000
 Man can't look after himself.

325
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,960
 So the human race dies.

326
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,160
 God doesn't spare, God doesn't give out judgement immediately because he has a bigger plan.

327
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,320
 And there is something else that we will talk about this later.

328
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,720
 The question we have to ask ourselves is, as we look at these wicked acts, as we look

329
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,560
 at these people who we think should be punished, the question is, what do we think they should

330
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,700
 be punished with?

331
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,400
 What do we think they deserve?

332
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,800
 But maybe the real question is, why do we think they deserve judgement?

333
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:43,400
 What pride is in us as we look at someone who we deem as wicked and say, "That person

334
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,460
 needs to be judged, God needs to punish that person."

335
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,080
 What pride is there in us when we think that?

336
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,800
 Because as soon as you realise, "Oh, everyone was created for good, we just simply have

337
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,720
 the choice to choose this."

338
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,980
 Then you realise that actually it is a lot more complicated, it is a lot more layered

339
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,600
 than just, "If someone does something wrong, you punish them severely."

340
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,280
 Every person who has had children will know this.

341
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,880
 Because it is not just as simple as the moment a kid does something wrong, that you just

342
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,400
 wipe them from the face of the earth.

343
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,120
 It's not that simple.

344
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,200
 There is the factor of love that we will explore a little bit more.

345
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,280
 But the preacher here, Kohele here, is very annoyed.

346
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,480
 He's saying, "These wicked people, they did all these bad things, but the moment they

347
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,880
 die, everyone forgets and they have the most wonderful funeral.

348
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,160
 And everyone's praising them."

349
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,920
 Have we seen that before?

350
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,360
 When someone dies and suddenly everyone just has great things to say about this person,

351
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,200
 but actually when they were alive, they really were not that great at all.

352
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,400
 And Kohele here is like, "That's not fair.

353
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,800
 That's not good."

354
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,400
 And we look around at people and we see these people who are cheating people out of their

355
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
 money, their pensions.

356
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,480
 You see these people who are just not looking after other people and yet they still get

357
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,800
 all the luxuries of life, they still get all the power, they still get all the fame and

358
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,200
 reputation.

359
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,760
 And we're like, "That's not fair."

360
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,760
 Right?

361
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,560
 They're wicked people.

362
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,440
 I'm the righteous one, yet I'm the one who's starving and I'm the one who's still slaving

363
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,160
 away where they seem to be living the life.

364
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,960
 The question really for us then is, as we think about that, is what do we think they

365
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,520
 actually deserve?

366
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,800
 What high horse are we sitting on?

367
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,080
 But the second question is, actually those things that we see that they're getting praised

368
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,720
 for, Kohele, as he looks at these people who are getting praised at their funeral, getting

369
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,640
 all these earthly praises, actually deep down, is that what we desire?

370
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,960
 These rich people who still get to live all their lives even though they don't care for

371
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,680
 anyone, actually, secretly, is that what we desire?

372
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,800
 Those of us who are lower on the ladder, we keep looking at the top of the ladder going,

373
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,040
 "Oh, if I had that, then I would be better.

374
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,040
 If I had the money that you had, I would be way more generous.

375
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
 If I did that..."

376
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,680
 And then you're like, "Well, actually, how generous are you with what you have?"

377
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:05,400
 Again, before we point that finger, there are three fingers pointing back at us.

378
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,760
 What do we even think is wicked?

379
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,680
 What do we think they actually deserve?

380
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
 Where do you draw the line?

381
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
 Let's talk about this.

382
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,160
 Let's pretend to play God for a second here.

383
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
 Let's wipe out evil in this world.

384
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,640
 Who are the first group of people that you'd wipe out?

385
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
 You're all thinking it.

386
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,240
 You're all thinking, "Well, we'll wipe out the murderers, right?

387
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,240
 The murderers, the tyrants, the dictators, the rapists.

388
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,880
 Let's wipe those out.

389
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,880
 Get rid of those."

390
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,360
 But there's still evil in the world.

391
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
 "Okay, well, okay.

392
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,120
 Well, the top tier are gone now, so let's wipe out the second tier."

393
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,600
 Who are the second tier?

394
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
 The bankers?

395
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,640
 "Let's wipe out the second tier of people, people who harm each other.

396
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,280
 They fight and they...

397
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,720
 Maybe they don't rape people, but maybe they cheat on their wife.

398
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
 Maybe let's wipe those out.

399
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,240
 They're still bad."

400
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,000
 And you're like, "Okay, well, wait, there's still evil in the world.

401
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,400
 Okay, well, actually, let's just wipe out the people who don't do any good for other

402
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
 people.

403
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,680
 They just look after themselves."

404
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,760
 It's a slippery slope, isn't it?

405
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,360
 When we're asking God, "Why are you sparing judgment on them?"

406
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,960
 The real question is, "Why is he still sparing judgment on us?"

407
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,380
 Because we're on that list somewhere.

408
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,400
 We all fall short of the glory of God, the holiness of God.

409
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,240
 We might not be 99% doing bad things all the time, but we're definitely not completely

410
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,840
 perfect.

411
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,880
 So the question then becomes, "What do we think they actually deserve?"

412
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,440
 There is no distinction.

413
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,320
 We all fall short of the glory of God.

414
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,680
 In fact, because we live in a broken world, we know that even the most evil people, the

415
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,040
 people who are doing the most evil acts, often because of the broken world that they grew

416
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,600
 up in, they are victims of the broken society themselves.

417
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,000
 If you watch the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and you watch all the villains that every

418
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,240
 movie has, there's always a backstory, right?

419
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,860
 There's always a backstory of why that person that was created for good became bad.

420
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,700
 Because they themselves were victims of a broken society.

421
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,960
 They themselves were victims of abuse.

422
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,840
 They themselves were victims of failure and deep trauma and hurt.

423
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:31,480
 So before we point the finger, once again, as believers, challenge ourselves, "Wait,

424
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
 wait.

425
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
 What is wicked?

426
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,820
 What is evil?

427
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,820
 What do I think they deserve?

428
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,040
 I don't know, because I know what I deserve, and I didn't get it, so I'm just going to

429
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,320
 stay in my lane."

430
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,400
 Let us think about that.

431
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
 Let us challenge that.

432
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,980
 And you see, Kohala here actually isn't annoyed at the wicked people.

433
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,220
 He's not even annoyed at the people in the city who are praising the wicked people at

434
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
 the funeral.

435
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,400
 Who's he annoyed at?

436
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,080
 He's annoyed at God himself.

437
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,820
 Because he's like, "God, you can do something about this, yet you're not doing anything.

438
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,760
 And because you're not doing anything, they're simply getting worse."

439
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,460
 So the final question that I realized as I was pointing the finger, as I was thinking

440
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,500
 about all these things about why there is such evil in the world, I realized the question

441
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,700
 that I needed to ask was, "How do I actually see God?

442
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,280
 How do you see God?

443
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,580
 When it comes to sin, when it comes to evil, how do I actually see God?"

444
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,020
 You see, Kohala's answer to all of this, he ends up giving up and just saying, "You know

445
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,020
 what?

446
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
 I've seen so much.

447
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,020
 You know what?

448
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,720
 The only thing I can really do is eat, drink, be merry, and fear God."

449
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,900
 That's what I'm going to do.

450
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,820
 The key here is, what does he mean by fearing God?

451
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,780
 When he says, "Okay, you know what?

452
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,740
 Let's just fear God."

453
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:58,060
 Fear God means to fully recognize who God actually is.

454
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,140
 Because we often have a distorted image of who God is.

455
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,860
 We think He's the great punisher.

456
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,340
 Every time we do something wrong, we think He's going to slap us on our hands.

457
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,020
 Every time something bad happens to us, we're like, "What did I do wrong?

458
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,260
 Maybe I bought something and put it into the house that was wrong.

459
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,800
 Maybe I said an unkind word to someone.

460
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,340
 Maybe I didn't do something nice, and so God's punishing me now."

461
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,260
 Don't we have that perspective sometimes?

462
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,760
 And yet, that's because we have a wrong perspective of God Himself.

463
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:34,340
 When we truly fear God, what he's saying is, we truly understand who He actually is, how

464
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:41,460
 wonderfully kind and gracious He is, how loving He is.

465
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,820
 The preacher here is saying, there's two kinds of people, and it's not wicked and righteous.

466
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,660
 It's those who fear God and those who don't.

467
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,380
 Because we all fall short.

468
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,580
 The question really is, are you in the camp that fears God, that knows who He is, that

469
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,020
 reveres Him, that trusts Him and loves Him?

470
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,980
 Or are you in the camp that actually don't fear Him at all?

471
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,360
 Those are the kinds of people that are in this world.

472
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,580
 And there's this passage in the New Testament that really talks about this as well.

473
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:13,980
 To Peter, Peter is hearing the same things, because he's talking about, the passage just

474
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,580
 before this, he's saying, "There are scoffers around you who are saying, 'Where's your God?

475
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,860
 Where's the judgment?

476
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:26,900
 If your God is so big and He's so holy, why isn't He coming to destroy us all now?'"

477
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,360
 Very similar to Noah, back in his day, when he was building that ark.

478
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,740
 The people were like, "Where is your God?

479
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
 What are you doing?

480
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,740
 This is so stupid.

481
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,740
 This is stupid.

482
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,740
 It's not even raining.

483
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
 It's sunny.

484
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,620
 Where is your God?"

485
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,220
 And yet in the day of Noah, the judgment came through flood.

486
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,540
 And soon, one day, there will be a second judgment that will come via fire.

487
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:52,300
 And Peter is talking to the people and saying, "Hey, look, those who are scoffing, ignore

488
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
 them.

489
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,900
 Those who are scoffing, thinking, 'Where is your God?

490
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,900
 Why isn't He giving judgment?'"

491
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,740
 He's saying, "No, do not overlook this one fact.

492
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,980
 Remember this one thing, beloved, that with the Lord one day is a thousand years and a

493
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,820
 thousand years as one day.

494
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,860
 The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward

495
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,260
 you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance."

496
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,460
 Do not overlook this one fact.

497
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,460
 This is the one thing about God that you need to know.

498
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,700
 And for even those of us who believe, we need to know this.

499
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,180
 We need to remember this.

500
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,300
 God is yes.

501
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,300
 He is holy.

502
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,740
 And yes, He will judge.

503
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,060
 And yes, He is fair.

504
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:34,580
 But above all, God is love.

505
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,940
 Jesus said Himself, "I didn't come to judge.

506
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,300
 I came to save."

507
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:46,260
 And until we get that into our minds, until we understand who God truly is, we will look

508
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,540
 at other people in the wrong way.

509
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:54,500
 The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise because a thousand years is like one day to

510
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
 Him.

511
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
 What does that mean?

512
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,720
 He stands above time.

513
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,180
 So we think, "God, why are you still letting that madman run that country?

514
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,060
 Why are you still letting that person do what they're doing?

515
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,720
 It's been five years!"

516
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,900
 And then you look at the book of Judges and you see that the Israelites get ruled over

517
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,980
 by the Babylonians for 80 years at a time.

518
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,900
 And you realize that actually God is working on a different time frame.

519
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,460
 The question here is, do we trust Him?

520
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,440
 That's what it's all about, right?

521
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,820
 So often we talk to God and say, "Look, where are we going with this?

522
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,860
 Where are you going with this project?

523
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,300
 Tell us where your destination is and tell us when you're going to get there.

524
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,120
 Because I need to know the ending of the story.

525
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,180
 I need to know that this bad guy eventually gets punished."

526
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,180
 And God's saying, "No.

527
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,300
 Do you know my heart?

528
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,680
 Do not overlook this.

529
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,580
 If you do, then trust me.

530
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,880
 Oh, I do trust you, God.

531
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
 I do trust you.

532
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,340
 But I just want to know where the ending is."

533
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,540
 Well, if you want to know where the ending is, then you don't really trust me.

534
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:03,260
 So the key here for us is, do we truly trust and believe who God is and do we truly fear Him?

535
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,360
 He is not sparing judgment out of indifference.

536
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,600
 He is not sparing judgment out of incompetence.

537
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,940
 He is sparing judgment out of patience.

538
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:21,660
 And aren't we all so grateful that He is patient to us?

539
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,400
 Aren't we all so grateful that He didn't send a lightning bolt down the first time we made

540
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,580
 a mistake?

541
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:34,060
 Which was actually when we were a baby.

542
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,000
 Aren't we glad that He is patient to us?

543
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,060
 So if He is patient to us, then what's our job when it comes to talking about the wicked?

544
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:50,060
 He is patient to us because He loves us.

545
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,420
 And He doesn't want us to compare.

546
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,740
 He doesn't want us to look across at the other side and go, "What about them?

547
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
 What about the wicked?"

548
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,780
 That's not what He wants.

549
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,860
 And this is where Kohelet is right.

550
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,220
 I've seen all of this.

551
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,220
 It's unfair.

552
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,220
 It's unright.

553
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,220
 It's confusing to me.

554
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,220
 I don't understand it.

555
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,220
 You know what?

556
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,620
 I must just fear God.

557
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,620
 I'll eat.

558
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,620
 I'll drink.

559
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,620
 I'll be merry.

560
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,660
 What is he saying?

561
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,900
 You know what?

562
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,040
 My understanding is limited.

563
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,180
 I don't know why God isn't dealing with that person.

564
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,900
 But my understanding is limited so I will stay in my lane.

565
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,160
 And my lane is to fear Him.

566
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
 Is to love Him.

567
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,960
 Christina and I, we have the honour of counselling couples.

568
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,560
 Couples who are just about to get married, who are just married.

569
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:43,720
 And they're kind of going through the conflicts of early marriage or any years, I guess.

570
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,240
 There's always conflicts in marriage.

571
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,240
 And then there's scripture that says, "Wives, submit to your husbands."

572
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
 And then the wife is like, "Oh."

573
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,400
 And the husband is like, "Oh, she's not submitting to me."

574
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,380
 And then the scripture is like, "Husbands, love your wives."

575
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:04,400
 And then the wife is like, "I can't submit to him because he doesn't love me."

576
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
 And I found it interesting.

577
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,720
 And at one time I was sharing this.

578
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
 It wasn't that long ago.

579
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
 I was like, "You know what?

580
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,560
 There's a reason why it says, 'Wives, submit to your husbands.'"

581
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,040
 Because at that moment, Paul is talking to the wives.

582
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,280
 He's not talking to the husbands and saying, "Husbands, your wives will submit to you."

583
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,280
 Unconditionally.

584
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,160
 That's not what he's saying.

585
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,600
 He's not saying, "Wives, your husbands will love you."

586
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
 That's not what he's saying.

587
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,600
 He's talking to each one and he's saying, "Wives, submit to your husbands.

588
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
 Follow their lead."

589
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,760
 "Husbands, love your wives."

590
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,600
 That doesn't mean that you just get to make all the decisions because she's submitting

591
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
 to you.

592
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,880
 It means you get to die first because love is to die, is to lay yourself down.

593
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,160
 That's the greatest example of love, right?

594
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,040
 So husbands are like, "Oh, I get to leave and my wife gets to submit to you."

595
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
 Yes, yes, yes, yes.

596
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:00,200
 But you also get to die first, which means when you're arguing, you get to be the one

597
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,720
 that says sorry first.

598
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,400
 You get to be the one that lays down your own preferences first.

599
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:12,760
 Wives, you get to submit to your husbands because he loves you, also because you're

600
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,200
 trusting that he will submit to God.

601
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,360
 But we must stay in our lanes.

602
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,800
 We must not look at, "You're not loving me."

603
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,560
 Let's just focus on, "Am I doing the thing that God's?"

604
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,040
 We should avoid the comparison.

605
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,760
 We should avoid looking across and going, "What about them?"

606
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
 God's saying, "Look at me."

607
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,400
 The final story is I'm reminded of Jesus.

608
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,920
 You see, Jesus, I'm sure you've heard of him.

609
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:42,600
 He comes to earth, Prince of Heaven, comes to earth, he dies, and then he resurrects.

610
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,440
 And then he goes to meet Peter, who has just messed up.

611
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,760
 He lied about knowing Jesus.

612
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,120
 And then he restores Peter by the fireplace in this really intimate setting.

613
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,760
 And he's saying, "Peter, do you love me?

614
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
 Do you love me?

615
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
 Do you love me?"

616
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
 And then Peter says, "Yes, I do.

617
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
 Yes, I do.

618
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
 Yes, I do."

619
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,760
 And then he says, "Well, feed my sheep.

620
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
 Feed my sheep.

621
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,760
 Look after my sheep."

622
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,760
 And then he says, "Actually, something bad's going to happen to you.

623
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,680
 You're going to end up giving your life to the gospel."

624
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,640
 And then Peter does the funny thing.

625
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,680
 Well, he's of course humbled because he made some mistakes.

626
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,000
 And then he does this thing and he says, "Well, okay, fine.

627
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,240
 But God, what about him?

628
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,160
 Do you know that bit?"

629
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,120
 He looks across and goes, "What about that guy?

630
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,800
 If I have to die, what about him?"

631
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,280
 And then Jesus says this just brutally honest and direct response.

632
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,040
 He says, "What is that to you?

633
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,260
 If I let him live forever, what is that to you?"

634
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,040
 He's telling Peter, "Stay in your lane.

635
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,520
 You love me.

636
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,320
 You keep your eyes on me.

637
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
 You serve me.

638
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,480
 You feed my sheep.

639
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,800
 You follow me.

640
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,120
 Don't worry about the rest."

641
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,360
 Because there's a danger.

642
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,680
 As soon as we start looking across into another lane, as soon as we start comparing, as soon

643
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,120
 as we start judging, "Oh, that person's wicked.

644
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,200
 Oh, that person's doing this.

645
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,280
 I think that person deserves this," we have lost our bearings once again.

646
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,520
 We've taken our eyes away from God and onto these other people.

647
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:16,480
 Let us not overlook the fact that God transcends time.

648
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,360
 He is not fazed by any evil empire, any institution, any bad person.

649
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,080
 He is not fazed by any of them.

650
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,160
 But he is patient because ultimately he doesn't want anyone to perish.

651
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,760
 That's the heart that we hold onto.

652
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,640
 That's the thing that we benefit from, his grace to us.

653
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:46,480
 Therefore we can fear him, eat, drink, be merry, despite us being surrounded by a wicked

654
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,800
 world.

655
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,440
 We don't need to ask the question, "What is wicked?" because we have a good shepherd who

656
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,760
 will look after us.

657
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,680
 We have a good shepherd who examines us and sees the wickedness in us.

658
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:06,160
 And yet he welcomes us in despite our wickedness.

659
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,200
 That is God.

660
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,520
 So I finish by asking you those same questions again.

661
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,760
 How do you, what do you think is wicked?

662
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:21,440
 What do you think they deserve?

663
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,720
 And before you think about them, let us think about us.

664
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,840
 And let us turn our eyes to the good shepherd who we can ultimately completely trust because

665
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,600
 we know he is in complete control.

666
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:45,840
 That is how a Christian, a follower of Christ, navigates this confusing, dark world.

667
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:54,640
 So let us eat, let us drink, let us be joyful and be merry, and let us fear our God because

668
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:55,640
 of who he is.

669
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
 Let us pray.

670
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:13,700
 So Father, we come before you with confusion sometimes, with frustration.

671
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:20,340
 Because we look around at the world and we see that it's just not what it should be.

672
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:24,620
 And our hearts break because it's fallen.

673
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,020
 People are hurting each other.

674
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:34,460
 And yet Lord, we pray that your Spirit would show us how we should truly live.

675
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:40,780
 That you would show us, you would remind us of your heart.

676
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:50,620
 So as we are face to face with wickedness, as we are face to face with hurt, that we

677
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:56,620
 would not approach it with pride, but we would approach it with the same love that you had

678
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,020
 for us.

679
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:04,060
 God, we seek your face.

680
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,420
 We want to know who you truly are.

681
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:11,540
 And we do not overlook the fact that you transcend time itself.

682
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:21,820
 And that you are not slow to bring judgment, but that you are patient so that we would

683
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,820
 not perish.

684
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,780
 And for that we are grateful.

685
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
 Thank you, Jesus.

686
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,620
 You are the good shepherd in whom we trust.

687
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,300
 We turn our eyes to you.

688
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
 It's in your name we pray.

689
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:35,800
 Amen.

690
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:45,800
