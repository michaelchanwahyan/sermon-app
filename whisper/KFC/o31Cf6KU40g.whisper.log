[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]  是不是?
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  他們有點混淆
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  主耶穌是誰呢?
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]  祂什麼時候會回來呢?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]  他們都不是很清楚
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]  是不是?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  然後呢

[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  Jesus說
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]  聖靈會來
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  但是祂會來幫我們什麼呢?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]  祂會教我們什麼呢?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]  祂會領我們去做什麼呢?
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  我不是很清楚
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]  是不是?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  然後呢
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]  他們都很害怕
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  那些羅曼斯
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]  是不是?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  那些羅曼斯可能是去
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]  找他們
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  找他們
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  這些是主耶穌的門徒
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]  祂在哪裡?
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]  找他們出來
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  他們有沒有搞事?
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]  是不是?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]  他們跟隨主耶穌
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  他們之前可能跟隨主耶穌去搞事
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]  是不是?
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000]  所以這些門徒
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]  是在受審嗎?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]  還是只是在被審問?
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  是不是?
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]  這些門徒
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  都是很迷茫的
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]  在這個時間
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  那麼
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  這個迷茫
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]  這個受審的時間
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]  這些門徒做了什麼呢?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  他們等候的時候
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  他們做了什麼呢?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]  你猜他們做了什麼?
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]  你猜他們做了什麼?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  你猜啊
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]  什麼?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  上班?
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  是不是回去釣魚?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  我們等候神
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  剛剛主耶穌
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  上了天
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  我回去釣魚
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  是不是?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  可能啊
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  可能啊
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  可能
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  我們看看
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]  第一章第二段
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000]  第二章第一章的第二段
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]  然後聖徒們
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000]  一起讀
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]  英文
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]  1,2,3
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]  然後聖徒們回到耶穌基督的教堂
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]  從山頂的
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  聖母塔
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  在聖誕節時
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]  他們從城裡走來
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  他們到達時
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  他們走到房間
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]  他們住的房間
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  那些人在場的
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]  是彼得
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]  約翰
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]  詹姆斯和安德魯
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  菲利普和托馬斯
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  巴爾多拉米爾和馬丁
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]  詹姆斯
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000]  埃爾維亞斯和塞門德塞勒
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  和朱德斯
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]  詹姆斯的兒子
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]  他們都在祈禱中
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]  不斷地聚在一起
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  與女人在一起
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]  與耶穌的母親
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]  和他的兄弟結婚
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]  我們看到
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]  門徒們在做什麼?
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]  在這個審訊的時間
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]  他們做了什麼?
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]  他們做了什麼?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  答案在這裡
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]  他們在聽
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  主耶穌叫他們做什麼?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]  耶穌叫他們去耶路撒冷
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]  去等什麼?
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]  去等聖靈
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]  等聖靈來到
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  等待耶穌
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  他們在聽耶穌的指令
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]  耶穌的聖靈會來
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  他們在聽
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  他們在聽耶穌的指令
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]  第二
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]  他們做什麼?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]  Samantha剛剛說的
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000]  奉行
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]  然後就是祈禱
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  在第14:13說
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000]  他們在祈禱中不斷地聚在一起
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]  他們在祈禱
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  等候主耶穌說的聖靈來
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  他們不斷地等待
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]  不斷地在祈禱
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]  第一他們是奉行的
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]  第二是祈禱
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]  第二他們是怎樣?
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]  我們繼續讀
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  Peter stood up among the believers and said
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000]  Brothers and sisters, the scripture has been fulfilled
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000]  in which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]  through David concerning Judas
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]  who served as a guide for those who arrested Jesus
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]  He was one of our number and shared in our ministry
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  Four, Peter said
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]  It is written in the book of Psalms
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]  My place has been deserted
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000]  Let there be no one to dwell in it
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  May another take his place of leadership
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000]  Peter then read the Bible
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  The Old Testament
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  What did he see?
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]  He saw a prophecy
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]  that someone would betray Jesus
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  Who would betray Jesus?
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]  Judas
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  We read it before
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]  Judas son of James
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]  Judas son of James
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]  was not the same Judas who betrayed Jesus
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000]  Do you know what happened after Judas betrayed Jesus?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  What did he do?
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.000]  He committed suicide
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]  He hung himself
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000]  He was so ashamed or embarrassed or suffering
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]  Suffering through what he had done
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]  Judas betrayed Jesus and he hung himself
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]  Peter saw the Old Testament
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]  He said, "OK"
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  The Old Testament predicted
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  The Holy Spirit predicted
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]  that this event would happen
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]  Jesus would be betrayed
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]  But what would happen to us?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  He saw it in Psalms
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]  May his place be deserted
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]  Let no one dwell in his place
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  And may another take the place of leadership
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]  May another take the place of leadership
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]  They saw in the Old Testament
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]  What is the leadership of God?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  Leading them to recruit another person
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]  To take their place
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]  We see in this passage
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]  Peter looked into Scripture as the foundation
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  They waited for God
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]  What did they do?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  They read the Bible
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]  They saw the Old Testament
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000]  The Old Testament predicted that this event would happen
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]  What should we do?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]  We should recruit another person
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]  Another person to take his place
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]  OK
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]  Third, when they waited for the Holy Spirit
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]  What did they do?
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]  They looked for God's leading
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]  They looked for God's leading
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]  Therefore, it says in verse 21
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]  It is necessary to choose one of the men
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000]  Who have been with us the whole time
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]  The Lord Jesus was living among us
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  So they nominated two men
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]  Joseph and another called Matthias
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]  They prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]  Show us which of these two
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:31.000]  You have chosen to take over this ministry"
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]  They cast lots
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]  The lot fell on Matthias
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]  He was added to the eleven apostles
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]  What did they do?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]  They prayed
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]  They waited for God to lead them
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]  They looked for God's leading
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]  They prayed, "Lord, you know everyone's heart
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]  You know our hearts
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]  Show us which of these two men you have chosen"
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]  They looked for God's leading
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]  They looked for God's leading
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]  OK
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]  The disciples
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  Let's recap
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]  The disciples
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]  In the next slide
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  What did the disciples do?
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]  The first is they obeyed and they prayed
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]  They obeyed and they prayed
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  They went to Jerusalem
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]  They waited for the Holy Spirit
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]  Then they were constantly in prayer
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]  Constantly in prayer
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]  Then they read the Bible
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000]  They read the Old Testament
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]  They read the Bible
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]  The prophets predicted this event
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]  The prophets predicted this event
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]  Then what?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000]  They waited for God's leading
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]  They looked for God's leading
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]  God, you lead us
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]  Which disciple to choose
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000]  To take over this ministry
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]  The fourth is we see in this scripture
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]  They have a supportive community
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]  They have a supportive ministry
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]  When they wait for the Holy Spirit
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]  OK
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:17.000]  Now we will invite Lucas to speak his testimony
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000]  OK
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]  Let's give him a round of applause
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]  Lucas, come up and speak your testimony
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]  Hello
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]  I will talk about how I wait for God
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.000]  It was about a year ago
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000]  I was a transfer student
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000]  I was in the 7th grade
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]  I was in the 2nd grade
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  I was bullied all the time
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]  I was beaten
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]  I was thrown away
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]  I was kicked and beaten
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]  It was painful
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]  I was like this every day
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]  I went back to school
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]  I couldn't read
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000]  I walked away
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000]  My books were scattered
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]  I went to the toilet
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.000]  My books were scattered
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]  I was on the floor
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]  It was painful
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000]  I prayed to God
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]  God, I feel so bad
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]  Can you let me go?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]  I feel so bad
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]  Nothing happened
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]  I was beaten
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]  I was kicked and pushed to the wall
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]  I was kicked and kicked on the stairs
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]  I was kicked on the stairs
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]  I was kicked on the stairs
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]  I was scared
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000]  I felt unsafe going back to school
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]  My teacher didn't help me
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]  I didn't care
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]  I was unhappy
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]  I was in the 8th grade
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  It was like this
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]  There was a teacher
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]  She was my teacher
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]  She always targeted me
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000]  She threw my books outside
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]  It was a mountain outside
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]  I couldn't pick them up
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]  I went back to the classroom
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]  I said, "Teacher, my books were thrown away"
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]  She yelled at me
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]  What excuse is that?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]  How dare you to lie to me?
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]  I was punished
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000]  Detention
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]  I was sent to the detention
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]  For 3 or 4 times
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]  Wow!
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000]  You were punished by a classmate
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]  Your teacher treated you like this
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]  Wow!
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]  I cried
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]  I prayed to God
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]  I asked the teacher
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]  I said, "Teacher, I'm in pain
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]  Can you help me?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]  I'm so unhappy"
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]  It was like this
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]  I was punished
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]  I was punished
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]  I didn't change anything
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000]  I had to avoid it
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]  I had to walk away
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]  Even my friends
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]  They didn't dare to play with me
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]  One of my friends told me
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]  She said, "I can't play with you"
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000]  Why?
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]  Because if I play with you
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]  I'll be punished
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]  I can't play with you
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]  If I'm punished, I'll be scolded
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000]  I can't do that
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]  Wow!
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]  I cried
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]  I thought
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]  I was back to school
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]  I was punished
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]  I was scolded
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000]  The teachers criticized me
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]  Once
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]  On the wedding website
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]  Someone wrote my name
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]  They scolded me
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]  They asked me why I went there
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]  Of course, I was punished
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]  I thought
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]  You punished me
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]  The teachers punished me
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]  My classmates punished me
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000]  Even my friends left me
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]  Wow!
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000]  I cried
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000]  I prayed to God
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]  I told God
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000]  Let me go
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]  I don't want to stay here
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]  One year passed
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]  Year 9
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]  I was scolded again
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]  Then, the pandemic came
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]  The pandemic was good
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]  I didn't have to go to school
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]  My grades improved
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]  Everything improved
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]  I went back to school
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]  I told my dad
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]  I couldn't go back
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]  Let me go
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]  He said
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]  Let's wait
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]  Let's wait
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]  I prayed to God
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]  Wow!
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]  God, let me go
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]  I couldn't go back
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000]  I was in school everyday
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]  Then
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]  Something strange happened
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000]  Someone wanted to punish me
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]  Then
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]  I was punished
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000]  Someone found the evidence
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]  He wanted to punish me again
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]  Then he showed it to the principal
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]  The principal scolded me
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]  He said
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]  No evidence
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]  This is only what they said
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]  They didn't do it yet
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000]  So
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]  They shouldn't get anything
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]  You're just thinking too much
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]  He scolded me
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]  I was surprised
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]  I thought
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]  I couldn't go back
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]  Even my classmates didn't help me
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]  Even the teachers didn't help me
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]  Then
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]  Dad scolded him
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]  He was fine
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]  He scolded him
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]  But nothing happened
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]  The people didn't get punished
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]  I was fine
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]  Then
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]  Dad finally said
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]  Son
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]  I'll help you
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]  I finally went to see
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000]  Then
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]  I found a school
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]  EU Chow International School
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]  I applied
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]  I remember that day
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]  I had an interview
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]  I had to do an exam
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]  I went in
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000]  I sat there
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]  I prayed for God
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000]  I said
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]  God
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]  Please protect me
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]  Let me go to school
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]  I really want to go to school
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]  I don't want to be bullied
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]  Beaten
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]  And so on
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]  Then
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]  OK
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]  I did it
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000]  I didn't hear from them for a month
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]  No news for two months
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000]  Then
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]  They sent me an email
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]  They said
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]  I could do a second interview
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]  I could interview the principal
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]  I had two principals
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]  I did the interview
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]  I felt good
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]  But
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]  I didn't hear from them for a while
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000]  Then
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000]  One day
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]  It was strange
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]  The parents
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]  Asked me a question
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]  They said
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]  If I was accepted
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000]  Would you go to school?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000]  I said
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]  I don't know
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]  God said
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]  But I really wanted to go to school
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]  I felt bad
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]  I was bullied
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]  Then
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]  I was accepted
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000]  Wow
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]  I cried
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000]  I thanked God
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]  I thought
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]  This is the time
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]  I finally came
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]  I waited for three years
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.000]  From year 7
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000]  To year 10
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]  Then I left
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]  Now I feel good
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000]  At least I went to school
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000]  I am good with my friends
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]  I don't have to go to school
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]  I don't have to carry anything
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]  If I leave it for two minutes
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]  I will lose everything
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]  I thank God
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000]  I can go to a new school
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000]  Thank you
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000]  Thank you, Lucas
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]  Lucas, welcome back to our
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]  Titus English Team
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]  So it's very good
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]  Thank you for sharing, Lucas
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]  We know
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]  You had a difficult experience
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]  Right?
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]  You were bullied at school
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]  And your teacher didn't help
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]  But we can see that
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]  He is waiting for God
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]  He prayed
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]  He waited for God
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000]  Do you want to give me different opportunities?
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]  New opportunity
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]  To go to different schools
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]  Let's ask ourselves
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]  When we wait
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]  Do we pray?
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]  When we wait for God
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]  Do we have different trials?
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000]  Do we read the Bible?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]  To wait for God
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]  To give us direction from His Word
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000]  When we wait for God
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000]  Do we ask God to lead us?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]  To give us direction
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]  And when we wait for God
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]  Do we have a supportive community
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]  To help us?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000]  Right?
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]  Lucas has his parents to support him
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000]  Right?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.000]  We have different trials
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]  Different times
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]  We have to wait
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]  Do we have a supportive Christian community?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]  Like the doors are together
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000]  We are constantly in prayer
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000]  I remember
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]  I have been in Hong Kong for 3.5 years
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]  I served in Hong Kong
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]  So fast
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]  I have known you guys for 3.5 years
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]  But before I came to Hong Kong
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]  I was a trainee in 2016
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]  In Hong Kong Buddhist Institute
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]  After I was a trainee
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]  I went back to Canada
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]  To study in Catholic University
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]  To finish my seminary
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]  Then the Hong Kong Buddhist Institute invited me
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]  Do you want to come back to serve?
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]  We are full time
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000]  I was thinking in 2017
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000]  The next slide is the picture of Hong Kong
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000]  I was thinking
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]  God, do you really want to bring me back to Hong Kong to serve?
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]  Right?
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]  Back to Hong Kong
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]  It was very hot in the summer
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000]  My friends were in Canada
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]  My family and parents were in Toronto
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]  Back to Hong Kong to serve
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]  There were different trials
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]  Different challenges
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]  I prayed
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000]  God, do you really want to lead me to Hong Kong to serve?
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]  If yes, may you open doors
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000]  Continue to open doors
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]  Right?
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]  Where do you live?
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000]  Do you live with your family?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000]  Or do you have different opportunities to live in different places?
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:05.000]  God provided a temporary stay for two months in Tai Kwun
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]  God provided there
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000]  God provided the opportunity to serve in Hong Kong
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000]  Pastor John, the English service, the lead pastor
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000]  He encouraged me to come back
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.000]  Everything lined up
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000]  I asked God to open doors
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]  He opened all the doors
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000]  I looked into scripture
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]  Scripture says in Isaiah
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000]  You will hear a voice saying to you
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000]  Look to the left or to the right
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000]  You will hear a voice
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]  Go to this direction
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]  I asked God
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000]  God, lead me
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]  Give me a clear sign
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]  When I was reading his word
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]  He gave me this passion for people in Hong Kong
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]  And obviously my parents were also very supportive
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000]  我的爸爸媽媽很鼓勵我
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]  To support me to come back to Hong Kong to serve
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]  And so
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.000]  What are you waiting for?
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]  What are you waiting for?
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000]  Today maybe you are healing
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]  受傷了
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]  Maybe you are physically injured
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]  Maybe you are emotionally injured
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]  And you are waiting for God to heal you
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]  Will you pray?
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000]  Will you read scripture?
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000]  Will you ask God for his leading?
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]  Maybe today you are like Lucas
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]  And you are going through things at school
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]  And it is very hard
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000]  And you are asking God to help you
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]  God is there
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]  He knows your heart
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]  He knows what you are going through
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000]  Will you pray?
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.000]  Will you pray?
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]  What is prayer?
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]  Prayer is us humbling ourselves
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]  謙卑
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]  是不是?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]  神知道我們會pray什麼
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]  但我們pray的時候
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]  我們的attitude是什麼?
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000]  我們的attitude is humbling ourselves before God
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]  As we pray
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]  We humble ourselves before an almighty powerful God
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000]  As we look to scripture
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000]  What is scripture?
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000]  Scripture is our foundation
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]  Scripture is our foundation
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]  And so when we wait
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]  We need foundation
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]  A strong foundation
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]  第三是什麼?
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.000]  As we wait
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000]  We need God's leading
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]  Sometimes we need to wait
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]  我們要等候神
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]  門徒也要等候
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.000]  聖靈主耶穌帶我們
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000]  To choose which disciple
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000]  Sam之前也要choose
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000]  神你帶我去哪個university
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]  Lucas是要等候
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]  你是否帶我去這個新的學校
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000]  這個新的opportunity
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000]  Surrendering ourselves to God
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000]  第四
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]  我們等候神的時候
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000]  我們需要一個支持的社區
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]  一群徒弟
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]  父母支持我們
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]  親朋好友是信徒
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000]  他們會幫助我們
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000]  在等候的時間
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]  我們會謙虛地祈禱嗎?
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]  我們會看著我們的基礎
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]  那就是石矢嗎?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]  我們會看著神
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]  和聖靈帶領我們嗎?
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]  我們會如何發展社區嗎?
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000]  我們請我們的慈悲團隊
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]  一起祈禱
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]  神父
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]  我們感謝您
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000]  對於文書
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000]  這段話在《聖刀》中
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]  我們感謝您
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000]  讓徒弟們等候
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]  祢的聖靈
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]  他們祈禱
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]  他們遵守
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]  他們看著您的文書
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000]  他們等候您的呼喚
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]  他們發展社區
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]  我祈禱在我們的情況
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]  不管我們處於什麼情況
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]  無論我們在牢裡
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000]  還是在牢裡
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000]  無論我們在等什麼
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.000]  祢會幫助我們
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]  做到一樣的事
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]  我們在耶穌的名下祈禱
