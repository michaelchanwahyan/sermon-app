[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   I feel quite emotional about that.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.240]   Michelle was right, Hong Kong is our home.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:19.000]   I do feel we've had words of prophecy over us that actually we're going to go to be ambassadors
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.840]   for Hong Kong.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.000]   A lot of people are talking a lot of nonsense about Hong Kong and everyone sort of saying,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.400]   "When are you leaving?"
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.800]   I feel that God has ordained us for this season to go overseas and really be ambassadors for
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.800]   Hong Kong.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.640]   So please keep us in your prayers and we will keep you in our prayers definitely.
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.440]   Well, we reached the end of our journey today.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:54.480]   Ten weeks of self-examination, ten weeks of practicing not giving the enemy a seat at
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.120]   your table.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.640]   To be honest with you, I'm going to miss it.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.920]   I'm going to give you an LOL moment though.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.360]   Bonnie is not going to miss having to set up the table with Taobao fruit every week.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:15.560]   But I just want to give a great thanks to Bonnie for week after week after week.
[00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.320]   I think she said to me on week two, "We don't need to do the fruit in the table anymore."
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.320]   I said, "Yes, we do."
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.920]   And she's done it faithfully every week.
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.720]   Thank you so much.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.400]   But maybe today is not the end.
[00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.800]   Actually today is the beginning of our journey.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:43.040]   I'm going to focus on some key biblical truths and I'm going to give you some seeds.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.000]   We are going to together, we're going to plant something today.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.420]   And I'm going to share an exercise where every day this week, you will share with yourself
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.220]   and hopefully with others a biblical truth.
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.080]   And I'm going to encourage you to learn some memory verses.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.200]   Do you remember that when you were at Sunday school?
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.480]   Now question, why do kids learn memory verses at Sunday school and we don't as adults, right?
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020]   We've got out the habit of it.
[00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.920]   Maybe we need to restore the habit.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.600]   I used to love doing, send them to song.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.800]   You sang a song and then you actually learned the Bible verse.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.280]   And we had a singer in the UK, James may have heard of him, called Ishmael.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000]   His name was actually Ian Smale, but he called himself Ishmael.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.840]   And all he did was take scripture verses and put them to song.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.480]   And he had one, it just went like this.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.480]   The song went like this.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.840]   Hebrews 11 verse six, "Without faith it's impossible to please God."
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.480]   That was the end of the song.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.120]   But you know, it may not have been a great song, but I've never forgotten since that
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.140]   time what Hebrews 11 verse six.
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.000]   And for those of you who are Sunday school teachers, who are teaching kids memory verses,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   keep on doing it.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.560]   And for us as adults, can we start doing it?
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.680]   Can I have amen to that?
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:21.480]   I believe that my seven seeds for seven days will grow into a beautiful garden.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.360]   It will change our flawed mindset that has enabled the enemy to gain a seat at our table
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.920]   into a mindset that leads to life.
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.200]   Now to enable us to do this, I need to ask us all a telling question.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.240]   And we need to be honest with ourselves with the answer.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.040]   Are you stuck?
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.360]   Are you stuck with a thought or an attitude?
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.200]   Somehow you can't get it out of your mind.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.740]   Are you stuck with a faulty concept of who you are?
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.880]   Are you still stuck with a gripping temptation that you can't seem to break free from?
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.080]   You know what God wants from you, yet you know it's difficult to get your mind off the
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.720]   path that leads to less than God's best plan for your life.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.120]   Now here is the brutal truth.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:27.620]   The battle for your life is fought and won in your mind.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.480]   God wants you to take control of your life in Jesus' name through the power of the Holy
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.400]   Spirit.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.200]   And it's actually down to having a right thinking.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.920]   That's what this series has all been about.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:54.560]   And because God is in the story with us, we are ultimately in a story of victory.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:03.680]   Yet we can still be tripped up and sidetracked along the way.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:13.960]   We can give the enemy a seat at our table, but we don't need to.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.440]   Romans 8 verse 6 gives a great summary of how we don't need to let the enemy sit down.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.480]   I'm reading this one from the NASB.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:40.240]   It says this, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.160]   life and peace."
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.080]   I love the imagery of a mindset.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.920]   We can have a new mindset, a new way of thinking, and I wanna answer the important question
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.360]   how?
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:07.280]   But first, are you ready for a new mindset?
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.440]   I want to show you a mindset that leads to life.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.280]   You can see it on the screen.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.800]   I wanna show you that your mindset can be different.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.400]   Your thoughts can be different, and your life can be different because your mind is set
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.320]   on Christ.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.520]   God is with you.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.680]   He is on your side.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.080]   He has established a beachhead of victory through Christ.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:46.000]   But we have to play our part.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.320]   The way you go about stopping the enemy from sitting at your table is by winning the battle
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.360]   for your mind.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:05.440]   It means replacing old harmful thoughts with new life-giving thoughts, and new life-giving
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.280]   thoughts will lead to changed behavior.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.160]   Victory begins in the mind.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.200]   Now one way of thinking less about the devil or the evil that you are trying to avoid and
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:32.400]   thinking more about God and the truth you're aiming to embrace is by memorizing Scripture.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.400]   Imagine your mind is a garden.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:45.680]   Seeds can be dropped by birds or float in the wind, but you as the gardener are responsible
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.760]   for what grows there.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:56.880]   You have the power to water good seeds, to cultivate the good seeds, and pull out the
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.740]   weeds from the seeds you don't want growing there.
[00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.720]   But how?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:20.080]   Look at Romans 12.2.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.680]   Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is.
[00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:30.400]   His good, pleasing, and perfect will.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:36.720]   Actually what Paul is saying here is you reap what you sow.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:45.240]   If you sow negativity, fear, pride, unclean thoughts, I could go on, that is what you'll
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.480]   reap.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.720]   Everybody, do yourself a favour.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:56.880]   Go home tonight, switch on your computer and check your history.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.800]   I dare you to do that.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.280]   That is what you are sowing into your mind.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:13.360]   Whose websites are you trusting your spiritual growth to?
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:21.540]   Think of who you hang out with, the company you keep, and their conversation.
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.040]   Is it uplifting?
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.860]   Or are they a bunch of complainers, cynics?
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:33.800]   Is their talk wholesome or is it leading you down a slippery slope?
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:42.120]   The way to renew your mind is to wrap your thoughts around Scripture.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.500]   Full stop.
[00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.360]   You can take control of what you think about.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:54.200]   Scripture helps you plant good seeds in your mind.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.440]   As these seeds take root and grow, they will help you remove the destructive weeds that
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:05.000]   the enemy tries to plant on your mind.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.520]   Now we get to the exciting bit.
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.120]   Seven seeds.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.680]   I've called this the mindset that leads to life.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.880]   Seven seeds for seven days.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:25.480]   Number one, tell yourself the truth and number two, memorise the verse.
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:33.140]   And I'm suggesting that you take one thought and one verse per day.
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:38.800]   Or maybe you take one thought and one verse per week for seven weeks.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:46.900]   Either way, plant and begin to cultivate these seven thoughts in your mind right now and
[00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.920]   personalise it for yourself.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.920]   There's good news.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.520]   You're going to be given a card.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.560]   You will never forget this series.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.040]   The yellow, right?
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:04.840]   You will be given a card that you'll be given during the final song at the end of the service.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.020]   Take this with you.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:10.560]   If you're listening online, we will post this online as well.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.560]   And this could be so valuable for you.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.900]   And if you need to take one for someone, if there's one over, take one.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.600]   So what we're going to do is we're going to look at the next week.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.920]   And firstly, we're going to look at Sunday, tomorrow.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.760]   You get up tomorrow morning.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.400]   The first thing I want you to do is to tell yourself a truth.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.580]   And the truth is this, I am in God's story.
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.320]   Not too difficult, right?
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.160]   In fact, let's repeat that together.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.160]   Ready?
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.160]   One, two, three.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.880]   I am in God's story.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.200]   Well, that's five of you.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   That's really good.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.200]   No, it's fantastic.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.840]   No, you did very well.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:58.560]   The story of who you are is part of God's larger story.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.960]   The story is bigger than you.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.160]   Ultimately, the story is not about you.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:14.000]   But you have been invited into the story of God's great glory and grace.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.800]   It's all about Him.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:26.080]   But you have a seat at His table.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.960]   Before you were formed in your mother's womb, God knew you.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.280]   Jesus, the good shepherd, guides you always.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:44.800]   And according to Psalm 37, 23, the Lord makes firm the steps of those who delight in Him.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.240]   So firstly, plant this thought in your mind.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.800]   I am in God's story.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.080]   And memorise this scripture.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.140]   I think you'll be familiar to many of you.
[00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.680]   Let's read it together, shall we?
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.440]   Go to the next slide.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.440]   Got it?
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.440]   The next one.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.440]   That's it.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.440]   Right, ready?
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   Okay, all together.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440]   One, two, three.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.840]   "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.440]   Plans to prosper you and not to harm you.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.080]   Plans to give you a hope and a future.
[00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.120]   Not too difficult to memorise that one, right?
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.960]   I think most of you know it.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.920]   Because you matter to God.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:36.680]   But ultimate meaning will not come from putting the spotlight on you.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:42.240]   Your life will have the greatest significance when you choose to make it about the one who
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.800]   welcomed you into His never-ending story.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.920]   I know Mondays, a lot of us don't fancy getting up Monday morning, workday, right?
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.440]   Monday morning, the alarm goes off.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.320]   Oh, it's too early.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:02.840]   Okay, wake up Monday morning and tell yourself, "I am fearfully and wonderfully made."
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.840]   Can we try that one?
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.360]   One, two, three.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:09.880]   I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:14.000]   Your birth was not a random act.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.800]   God made you with intention and God made you wonderfully.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:28.840]   Isaiah 43, one says, "God has redeemed you and knows your name."
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.120]   So plant this in your mind.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.080]   I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:40.080]   You know, I think I told you a few weeks ago, my younger sister is 18 years older than me.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.720]   And for many years, the family joke was, I was the family mistake, right?
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.720]   But I'm not.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:49.160]   I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.440]   And memorize this scripture together.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.440]   It's found in Psalm 139.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.440]   Let's all read together.
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.440]   Yeah, good.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   One, two, three.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.240]   "For you create my inmost being.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   You knit me together in my mother's womb.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.640]   I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.400]   Your works are wonderful.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:13.640]   I know that full well."
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.320]   You're not the maker.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.640]   You are made.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:24.640]   God is not created in your image, how you think he should be.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.360]   But you are created in his image.
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.720]   He decided that he wanted you in his universe.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.000]   He imagined you and he fashioned you.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.320]   You are not accidental, incidental.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.080]   You are divinely crafted.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:52.240]   Plant this seed every day and in time, you'll have an oak tree providing shade for you and
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.920]   those around you.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:05.160]   You will begin to believe that you are who God says you are, unique, special, valuable.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.080]   Okay, we guess better with Tuesday.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:09.080]   It's getting better, right?
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.080]   So we have Monday out of the way.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.080]   Tell yourself, "My life has purpose."
[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.080]   Very easy, right?
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.080]   Four words.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080]   One, two, three.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   "My life has purpose."
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.080]   You were born for a noble reason.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.080]   God has good things for you to do.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.080]   He has called you to live for what matters.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   So plant this thought in your mind and memorise this scripture from Ephesians 2.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   One, two, three.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:49.080]   "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   us in advance for us to do."
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:17:00.080]   Random things are random, but created things have purpose.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.080]   There is just one you.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.080]   There's just one me.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:09.080]   Thank goodness you say.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:14.080]   You have a unique calling, a reason for being.
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   Something to do in God's story that is important and needed.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:26.080]   You know, we don't have to be 007 James Bond to have a special assignment, right?
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.080]   You have a special assignment.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.080]   Do not buy the lie that you are expendable.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.080]   God put you on earth for a purpose.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:43.080]   Your life matters to Him and to those He is positioning you to serve.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:46.080]   Okay, we come on to Wednesday.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:51.080]   The truth is this, the cross has the final word.
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.080]   Can we say it all together?
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:56.080]   The cross has the final word.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   What Jesus did on the cross defines your life.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   It gives you victory over death.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.080]   We've been singing about it.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.080]   You're identified with Christ.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   You're a brand new creation.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   You are not unwanted, unlovely or worthless.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:19.080]   You are wanted by God, made in the image of God and worthy of Christ's love because He
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.080]   has chosen to place worth upon you.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   Your identity was born in the death, the burial and the resurrection of Christ.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   And wasn't that wonderful last Saturday morning when we celebrated that at the beach.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:48.080]   Do not let anyone try to convince you of anything that wasn't demonstrated to you when Christ gave His life for you.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.080]   You are forgiven.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:52.080]   You're made whole.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.080]   You are holy in Christ.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.080]   You were born into a new family.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:19:00.080]   You are woven into divine plans and purposes.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.080]   Gone.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   Your guilt is gone.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.080]   Free.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   You are free.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   So plant this thought in your mind that the cross has the final word and memorize this
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   scripture from 2 Corinthians.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.080]   Ready?
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:18.080]   1, 2, 3.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.080]   "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   The old has passed away.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:30.080]   Behold, the new has come."
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:36.080]   As we get on to Thursday, talk about us serving.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:42.080]   The truth is I serve at the pleasure of the King.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.080]   Can we say that together?
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.080]   I serve at the pleasure of the King.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   You know the work of Jesus Christ transforms your work.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.080]   You don't merely work at a job.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.080]   Charles, you don't just work at AIA.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.080]   You serve Jesus Christ, the King of Kings.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:09.080]   In the light of this truth, here is a new personal vision for you.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.080]   It's a statement you can remind yourself each day.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.080]   I am dispatched by the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:23.080]   I'm on kingdom assignments to be light in a darkened world so that others can see Jesus.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:29.080]   If you look at your work that way, you'll see it in a completely different light.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:35.080]   So plant this thought in your mind and memorize this scripture together from 1 Peter 2.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   Ready?
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   "But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession,
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:53.080]   that you may declare the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His wonderful light."
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:58.080]   So we're on to Friday.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:05.080]   Jesus is Lord and Jesus is my Lord.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.080]   Can we say that together?
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.080]   Jesus is Lord and Jesus is my Lord.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:18.080]   Our God is stronger than anything, higher than anything and worthy of all praise.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.080]   Your God is the great King.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   His kingdom is forever.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.080]   His plans are unassailable and sure.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.080]   So plant this in your mind.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.080]   Jesus is Lord.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   It's not just Jesus.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.080]   It's not enough.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.080]   Jesus is Lord and Jesus is my Lord.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.080]   And memorize this scripture, Philippians 2.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.080]   Ready?
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.080]   1, 2, 3.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   "Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him the name that is above every name,
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:52.080]   that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:59.080]   and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.080]   Amen.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:07.080]   Okay, next Saturday, just before you come back here again with our new teaching series,
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.080]   the truth is this.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   My God turns evil into good.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   Can we repeat that one?
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.080]   My God turns evil into good.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.080]   Life doesn't always work out the way you hope.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.080]   We are living on a broken planet.
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:26.080]   Just read the news headlines.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:34.080]   But no circumstance can hinder the seeds we've just discussed from being cultivated in your mind.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:43.080]   No hardship or disappointment or disease or divorce or darkness or desert can stunt the growth of godly thoughts
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   from becoming mighty trees in your way of thinking.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   So plant this thought in your mind.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.080]   My God turns evil into good.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.080]   And memorize this scripture from Romans 8.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.080]   I think we all know this one.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.080]   1, 2, 3.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   "And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God,
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:12.080]   to those who accord according to His purpose."
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   KFCI.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:20.080]   God has spoken these truths in His Word.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:27.080]   If we can start here, if we can plant these in our minds,
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:33.080]   if we can keep nurturing them until the Word takes root and grows and produces a crop,
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   it will change your life.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   It will change this church.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:45.080]   And I believe it will transform our city.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.080]   The garden is your mind.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:56.080]   Where you are growing a transformed person by planting God's Word.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   And that person is sitting at the table.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:07.080]   The place of fellowship with the Good Shepherd.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:11.080]   Where you don't want to give the enemy a seat.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:20.080]   Where you want to enjoy a meal with the Lord and it's not plastic fruit from Taobao.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.080]   Don't be scared.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:33.080]   Jesus, the Good Shepherd, guides you all the way.
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:41.080]   I now want to wrap up 10 weeks in less than 10 minutes.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.080]   Scripture is clear.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.080]   Jesus lives in you.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:52.080]   And when Jesus lives in you, your slate is clean.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:55.080]   You are set free from condemnation.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   You're given a new life and you're placed into a new family.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   You have a relationship with God through Jesus.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   Christ's work on the cross got you out of death.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:14.080]   So now your life can be lived, fully surrendered to Him.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:21.080]   You are alive in the Spirit, alive by the Spirit, alive for Christ, alive in Christ,
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.080]   so that He might be glorified.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.080]   This is not a negotiation.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:38.080]   This is a call to completely surrender to Jesus.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:43.080]   You are completely open, completely available to Him.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:47.080]   He has given you a new identity.
[00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:54.080]   Your call is to make Him known to the world.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.080]   I don't know about you.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.080]   I want to set my mind on Jesus.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   [Sobbing]
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   I want to constantly fill my mind with Scripture.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.080]   I don't want to waste my time.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.080]   I don't want to get off track.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:38.080]   I don't want to give the enemy a seat at my table.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   I want to set my mind on the Spirit and daily surrender to Him.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   God has made a way for you and me.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.080]   And it's not by having our own way.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:59.080]   It's by entering into the process of making Christ known in the world.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   I know I want God to move in a supernatural way in my life.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   I don't want average.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.080]   I don't want the easiest path.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.080]   I want to know God intimately, deeply.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:19.080]   I want my life to defy explanation.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:25.080]   And I'm thinking, this is the life that you want too.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.080]   This kind of life can be yours.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   One that is fully dependent on the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.080]   and is activated by you stepping forward in faith.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:45.080]   Too often, we want to see miracles first before we take a step.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.080]   "Okay God, you do something great and then I'll take a step."
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:55.080]   "Give me all the right words first and then I'll take the microphone."
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.080]   "Give me all the money first and then I'll start with what you called me to do."
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:06.080]   "Give me the spouse I need and then I'll step into the unknown."
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:11.080]   But the fullness of the life that Jesus provides becomes evidence to us often
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:17.080]   when we move and we act upon his leading.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:23.080]   When we open our mouth and speak.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:30.080]   The steps we take in faith activate the power of the Spirit.
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:37.080]   Just as I'm speaking now, I've just got a picture of a beach and a seafront.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   Too many Christians are sitting on a beach waiting for the sea to come in.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.080]   "I haven't heard from God yet. I'm just going to sit here."
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.080]   When God is saying, "Put your foot in the water."
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.080]   "See what the water is like and I'll take you."
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   That will activate the power of the Spirit.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.080]   That's your call today.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   You can win the battle for your mind.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.080]   Don't give in to sin, despair or darkness.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   Take every thought captive.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   Bind every thought that doesn't come from God.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   Fill your mind with goodness and the richness of Scripture.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.080]   Memorize with Scripture.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.080]   This is just a start but start with this.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.080]   Memorize the Scripture and become as Michelle told us,
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.080]   the DJ of your mind.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:41.080]   Letting thoughts of God consistently fill your heart and life.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:48.080]   My friends, surrender your life completely to Jesus
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:55.080]   and He will lead you to green pastures and quiet waters.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:01.080]   He will lead you through dark valleys because you don't ever need to fear.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.080]   You will not be in want because Jesus will restore your soul.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:12.080]   Jesus will lead you to a table in the presence of your enemies
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:19.080]   but there's nothing to worry about because your head is dripping with anointing.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.080]   Your cup overflows with abundance
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:32.080]   and goodness and mercy are following you all the days of your life.
