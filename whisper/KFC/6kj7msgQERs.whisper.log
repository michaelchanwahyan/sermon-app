[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.720]   It is delightful to be able to bring to you the Word of God tonight.
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:18.400]   And it's been an amazing series so far, just to be able to look into the Book of Revelation
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.400]   and the seven letters to the seven churches.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.400]   We start off with the book, the letter to the Church of Ephesus.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.760]   Now if we open the PowerPoint, we'll see that Ephesus was the New York of that time.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.000]   It had over 200,000 people, right?
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   It was the New York and the busiest, the most popular city of that time.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.480]   Yet Jesus was saying to them, "You have lost your first love.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.680]   You have lost your first love."
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.400]   We looked into the letter to Smyrna.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.640]   It was the fragrance capital.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.880]   It was like one of the, you know, Southern France fragrance capitals like now, right?
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.160]   Most of the fragrance of the world comes from France.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.280]   But they were a suffering church.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.360]   Jesus said they were poor, but yet they were rich in Christ.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.720]   And Jesus was asking them to stay faithful, stay faithful.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.640]   We looked at Pergamum, right?
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.360]   It was a worldly church and Jesus was telling them to repent and follow God.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.600]   Stop accepting the ways of the world.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.120]   Thyatira, they accepted wrong doctrine.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.760]   And Jesus asked them to repent and follow God's word instead.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.440]   Sardis was the dead church.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.480]   And Jesus says, "Wake up, right?
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.960]   Strengthen what remains."
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.840]   Philadelphia, we looked at that last week.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.920]   And Pastor Michelle did a great job of telling us how this church was spiritually alive.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.720]   And Jesus told them to hold fast.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.240]   And now finally, we arrive at the last church, Laodicea.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.560]   And we're going to see what Jesus says to this church.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.240]   And we'll read Revelations chapter three.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.360]   So the angel of the church in Laodicea write, "These are the words of the Amen, the faithful
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.320]   and the true witness, the ruler of God's creation.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.240]   I know your deeds that you are neither cold nor hot.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.040]   I wish you were either one or the other.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.520]   So because you are lukewarm, neither hot or cold, I'm about to spit you out of my mouth.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.240]   You say, 'I am rich.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.000]   I have acquired wealth.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.600]   And I do not need a thing.'
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:53.720]   But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.360]   I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire so that you can become rich and
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:10.560]   white clothes to wear so that you can cover your shameful nakedness and selves to put
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.840]   on your eyes so that you can see.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.800]   Those whom I love, I rebuke and discipline.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.880]   So be earnest and repent.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.880]   Here I am.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.280]   I stand at the door and knock.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.960]   If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person and
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.000]   they with me.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.600]   To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne just
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.880]   as I was victorious and sat down with my father on his throne.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.800]   Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:58.480]   So we see firstly that Jesus says he introduces himself as the Amen.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.900]   These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and the true witnesses.
[00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.140]   Now obviously we say Amen after every prayer and it means it's true.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:19.040]   And Jesus himself claims that he is the truth, that he is the faithful and true witness.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:25.960]   And we're going to see why Jesus claims that he or emphasizes here that he is the faithful
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.280]   and true.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.760]   Firstly we're going to look into the Church of Laodicea.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   Three things, the criticism of this church, Christ's challenge for this church, and finally
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.320]   the covenant that Jesus makes and the promise that he makes with this church.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.840]   So firstly let me introduce some background about the Church of Laodicea.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.480]   It was the banking center of that region, right?
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.620]   It was the financial center of that world.
[00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.960]   They had huge banks and all the treasuries were there.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.680]   It was, Laodicea was built on major trade routes, all right?
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.620]   So it was known for its beautiful textiles of woolen, of tunics.
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.840]   It was built on the trade routes where people would pass through, all the major trade routes.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.300]   It also had a major breakthrough in eye medicine, special eye medicine, that people came from
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.720]   all over the world, Aesop, to have this cure for eye medicine.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:41.680]   And so we will see how Jesus speaks intentionally into the specific characters, characteristics
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.920]   of this church.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.880]   Well we read in verse 15 that Jesus claims, "I know your works.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:59.320]   You are neither cold nor hot, that if you were either cold or hot, so because you are
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.560]   lukewarm, neither hot or cold, I will spit you out of my mouth."
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.880]   The traditional view is this, right?
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.860]   That you're not hot, you're not fervent, you're not zealous, you're not all in for Jesus,
[00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.640]   you're not cold, you're not uncommitted, you know, just don't care about Jesus.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:26.680]   But Jesus interestingly here says that hot and cold are sort of positive things, right?
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.880]   You're neither cold nor hot.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   And we're going to see why Jesus says cold and hot were sort of good things.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:44.160]   In the nearby cities, Hierapolis, it had hot springs, right?
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.340]   Who's been to the hot springs?
[00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.220]   Who likes hot springs?
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.160]   Hierapolis had these beautiful hot springs.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.200]   They were medical, healing hot springs.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.400]   Nearby there was also the city of Colossae.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.060]   It was near the mountains.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.580]   So they had fresh, life-giving spring water, right?
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.380]   But this city, Laodicea, did not have water.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.660]   It did not have water.
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:23.100]   In fact, they had to build pipes from nearby cities to ship in the water.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:30.020]   And as this water was coming in, the sun would heat it up and it would become sort of lukewarm,
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.280]   tepid.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.180]   And also it was full of minerals, this water.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.820]   And I remember going to the city of Waterloo, the University of Waterloo, which is pretty
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.820]   close to Toronto.
[00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.900]   I know some of our students, you know, go there.
[00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.060]   And when I was staying over there, I looked into the tap water and there was like white
[00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.300]   residue on it.
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.540]   There was minerals on it.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.860]   This was the kind of water that Laodicea had.
[00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.500]   It was full of minerals.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.660]   You know, if you boiled it, it would, you know, sort of sink up the air.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.140]   If you boiled your vegetables, it would change the taste of the vegetables.
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:16.020]   This water, it wasn't refreshing and cold like Colossae, you know, which you could bottle,
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.020]   right?
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.480]   Colossae bottled water.
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.100]   It wasn't the healing hot spring water of Hierapolis.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.460]   This water in Laodicea was tepid, full of minerals.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.260]   You wanted to spit it out of your mouth.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.420]   Have you eaten something and then like, "Ugh, it's rotten."
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.340]   You just want to spit it out of your mouth.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:43.100]   And that is what Jesus says here, that you are like your water.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.620]   I want to spit you out of my mouth.
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:53.500]   I don't want, you know, lukewarm water, mineralized, you know, it just didn't taste good.
[00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.120]   This water was no good.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.700]   And so Christ's criticism against this church was of two things, as we see in the next slide
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:03.700]   here.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.180]   One, it was the wrong work.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.380]   They had the wrong work and they had the wrong evaluation.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.660]   And so we're firstly going to see the wrong work.
[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.540]   We don't know exactly what happened in this church.
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.860]   They either did no work for Jesus.
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.220]   They did not serve Jesus.
[00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:26.420]   They did not have a heart for Jesus or their work was compromised.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:32.020]   Obviously in the Roman situation back then, there was a lot of adulterous worship, just
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.860]   like we saw in all the other cities.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:42.260]   And possibly this church was influenced by the Roman idolatry, right?
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:49.780]   Their church had become so accustomed to the Roman idolatry ways and traditions that they
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.980]   were not effective and unfaithful in their witness for Jesus.
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:59.660]   And secondly, Jesus criticizes them of wrong evaluation.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.500]   He says here, "For you say, I am rich.
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.740]   I have prospered.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:17.660]   I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked."
[00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:26.660]   In fact, they may have equated their economic prosperity with their spiritual health.
[00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:31.800]   Laodicea was the richest city of that time.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.980]   It was so rich.
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.580]   In fact, in AD 17, there was a massive earthquake, right?
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.100]   It hit all the cities, Philadelphia and Laodicea.
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:46.420]   And a lot of these cities were crying out to Rome, "Rome, we need your help.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.060]   Help us restore our buildings.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.060]   It's all collapsed."
[00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.260]   Laodicea was so rich.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.580]   They said, "We don't need your help, Rome.
[00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.620]   We can build back our city ourselves."
[00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.460]   That's how rich Laodicea was.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:01.220]   Laodicea was so rich.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.940]   They had two coliseums.
[00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:08.060]   Ephesus was a population around 200,000.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.860]   They had one coliseum.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.460]   Laodicea had 40,000 people.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.860]   They had two coliseums.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.220]   That's how rich they were.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.700]   They were, in modern city, it would be maybe like Dubai, right?
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:28.780]   With its Dubai Mall, with its huge towers, with its fancy restaurants, with its posh
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.260]   cars and shops.
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:36.540]   Laodicea may have been like Hong Kong, the financial center.
[00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:44.140]   Laodicea was so rich, and yet Jesus said to this church, "You think you're rich, but in
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.820]   fact you are poor."
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.140]   And we learned of a church that was poor, Smyrna, right?
[00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:55.420]   They didn't conform to the idolatry of that time.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:59.340]   They did not conform to the ways of the world.
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.700]   And because of that, they were physically poor.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.980]   They may have not had jobs or could not trade or do business, but yet Jesus said they were
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.620]   spiritually rich.
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:12.860]   And Jesus says that Laodicea is sort of the opposite.
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:22.380]   They are rich physically, but poor spiritually.
[00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:28.860]   And could that be us today, in our situation, as we see in the next slide, that we have
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.860]   conformed to this world?
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:38.700]   Is Jesus accusing us today of the wrong works, that either we've conformed to the patterns
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:45.940]   of this world or that we have the wrong evaluation of ourselves?
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:52.840]   You know, ever since I've been in Hong Kong for three years now, time passes so quickly,
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:59.920]   I've seen that Hong Kong people are just rushing from appointment to appointment, rushing from
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.660]   MTR to MTR.
[00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.540]   They're like zombies, right?
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:15.020]   Rushing from schoolwork to university, from university to their job, trying to climb that
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.580]   corporate ladder.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:24.140]   We have just been chasing after this world, and we've been consumed by the world and conformed
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.600]   to the patterns of this world.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:33.680]   Maybe we have the wrong evaluation of ourselves.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:40.020]   We think we're doing well because, oh, we have a great job, we have a great family,
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.660]   we're attending church every Sunday.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.100]   We look great on the outside.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:50.020]   But could it be that we have the wrong evaluation of ourselves?
[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:56.900]   That we see ourselves as doing so well on the outside, but Jesus says, you are in fact
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:02.900]   are poor, pitiful, blind, and naked.
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.020]   And that can be for myself as well.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:11.780]   I have a lot of energy, I love going from passion to passion, and yet sometimes I forget
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:19.620]   the most important thing, and that is spending time with God, that relationship, real relationship
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:26.020]   with the Father, and then fellowship with each other.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:34.300]   So we firstly, we see Christ's criticism, Christ's criticism that they have the wrong
[00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.340]   work and the wrong evaluation.
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:45.100]   And sometimes not only do we have wrong self-evaluation of ourselves, we have wrong evaluation of
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.540]   others.
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:53.700]   The really popular show that just, a new season that just came out was The Crown.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.620]   People thought Princess Diana, wow, she's so beautiful, she married the perfect guy,
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:06.420]   she's a princess, she has the most fans in the world, but yet, you know, as it reveals
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:13.900]   in documentaries that she married the perfect person, the prince, but yet there was no love
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.340]   in that relationship.
[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:23.260]   And she was seeking after true love, because Charles was going off with somebody else.
[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:28.180]   She had all the fans of the world, and we thought, wow, she's so popular, so loved,
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:36.540]   and yet there's documentation that she was lonely, that she was isolated in the palace.
[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:43.180]   So not only do we have the wrong evaluation of ourselves, sometimes we see the world,
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:48.540]   and we have the wrong evaluation of the world.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:57.820]   And next, and next, we see Christ's challenge to the Church of Laodicea.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:07.660]   Gold refined by fire, white garments, and I said, and firstly, Jesus says, I counsel
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:14.140]   you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:19.540]   Jesus was like, you guys are so rich, you like to shop, you know what, you should come
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.220]   buy from me, you should shop from me, right?
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.940]   And Jesus is challenging the banking institution of that time.
[00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:35.600]   Laodicea, the Church of Laodicea, you're so rich, but in fact, you are poor, you should
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.900]   be buying from me, because you have spiritual poverty.
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:48.740]   And Jesus warns this church against relying on the banking institution of that time.
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.540]   Gold refined by fire, what does it mean?
[00:16:51.540 --> 00:17:01.980]   It means that you put gold into a hot furnace, so that the impurities would come out.
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:07.860]   And how do you know, how did the blacksmith know that this gold was ready?
[00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:13.660]   Because blacksmith knew that the gold was pure, when he looked into the gold, and he
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.140]   could see his own reflection.
[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:21.340]   He could see his own reflection.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:22.980]   And that is what Jesus wanted.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:29.980]   Jesus wanted to purify them, so that Jesus, when he looked at these people, this church,
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.880]   he could see his own reflection.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.940]   Jesus wanted to see himself in this church.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:42.340]   And that's why he says, "Buy from me gold refined by fire."
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:48.780]   Next we see, Jesus says, "Buy from me white garments, so that you may clothe yourselves,
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.260]   and the shame of your nakedness might not be seen."
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:18:00.420]   You love your beautiful textiles, your woolen, your tunics, and yet you are naked, Jesus
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.080]   says.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:12.440]   The church of Laodicea relied on their outward appearance, on their fashion, and yet deep
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:17.620]   down they were naked, because they were unfaithful to the Lord.
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:25.700]   They served foreign gods, and Jesus criticized them for relying on their outward appearance.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:34.680]   And lastly, Jesus criticizes them, challenges them to buy eye salve, to anoint your eyes
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.400]   so that you may see.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.080]   They had this special cure, right, of eye salve, eye medicine.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.040]   And they're like, "We don't need Jesus.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.520]   We have the best medicine in the world.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.760]   We have the best clothing in the world.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.720]   We have the most money in the world.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.160]   We do not need Jesus."
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:06.980]   And Jesus was in fact challenging them, "You are blind, you are naked, and you are poor."
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:13.740]   Could it be that we are in the same situation as we see in the next slide?
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.140]   That we say, "Oh, we don't need Jesus.
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:18.740]   We have all the entertainment in the world.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:25.280]   We can flood our mind with Netflix and show after show, binge after binge.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.780]   We don't need Jesus.
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.780]   We don't need...
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.380]   We have our hunger satisfied.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.100]   We have all the buffets in the world.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.500]   We can jump from cultural food, Thai to Viet, to Indian.
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.140]   We have all the food in the world.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.140]   We don't need Jesus.
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.680]   We have all the money in the world.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:41.680]   We don't need Jesus.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.120]   We have all the education and knowledge, Google, in the world."
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.880]   Could it be that we are like the Church of Laodicea?
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:59.080]   That we thought we had it all, and yet in fact, Jesus says we have nothing.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.720]   We're spiritually poor.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   We're blind.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:09.320]   We can only see ourselves in our own outwardness, and we can't see within the nakedness of our
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.200]   heart the sin that is within.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.480]   Could it be?
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:21.360]   Could it be that we are blinded from truly seeing ourselves?
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:29.440]   And so Christ's challenge to the Church of Laodicea is this, "To whom I love, I reprove
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.120]   and discipline, so be zealous and repent."
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:39.760]   And Christ's challenge is this, that we should repent.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:45.920]   This church should repent and go back towards Jesus.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:51.800]   And it's so encouraging here, "To those whom I love, I discipline."
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:58.320]   Just as a father loves his children, you discipline your children.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:04.760]   And the last thing we're going to look at is Christ's covenant with the Church of Laodicea.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.520]   So we went through the criticism.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.380]   They had the wrong work.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.120]   They had the wrong self-evaluation.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.960]   Christ's challenge to them was, "Buy from me.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   You like to buy?
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.720]   Buy from me.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.720]   Gold refined by fire so that you won't be poor.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:22.800]   White garments so that you won't be naked.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.320]   True eye salve so that you won't be blind."
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.880]   And now we see Christ's covenant.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.140]   Let us read verse 20 again.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.360]   And he says firstly, "Here I am.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:36.880]   I stand at the door and knock."
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:45.200]   If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person and
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.280]   they with me.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:52.920]   To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne just
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:57.840]   as I was victorious and sat down with my father on his throne.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:04.240]   Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:10.960]   Firstly, Christ promises fellowship with this church.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:17.720]   And second, a restored position, a position.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.000]   And so firstly, we see fellowship, right?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.160]   "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:29.760]   If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him."
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.360]   You know, there was some report that just came out.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.840]   I just saw it on CNN or something like that, that the Romans used to feast.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.320]   You know how many for how long?
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.800]   They used to feast for hours, maybe days.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.840]   They would have meal after meal.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.240]   And I don't know if this story was right, that they would puke out some of the things
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.800]   that they ate so that they could eat more.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.440]   You know, that's what sort of Princess Diana did, right?
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.020]   She wrote that in her book, that she was going through that.
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:06.680]   And this is what the Romans did, that they would feast with each other for hours on end,
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.680]   hours on end.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.680]   And you would only feast with people that you would consider close friends, right?
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.160]   You don't know if, you know, some people would want to poison your food or whatnot.
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:19.880]   You know, they didn't have the same food regulations as we do today, right?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:24.680]   And so Jesus is saying, "I promise you that I am here.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.600]   I want to be in your life."
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:34.560]   "Stop replacing me with money.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.960]   Stop replacing me.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.640]   Stop replacing me with your white garments.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.480]   And instead be clothed by me, be a new creation in me.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:54.180]   Instead of relying on your medicine, would you rely on me to heal you?
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.340]   Would you rely on me to heal you?"
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.880]   And so that's the first thing, that Jesus promises that they would have fellowship if
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:07.160]   they are willing to open the door and let Jesus in.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:14.080]   And the second thing that he promises is that whoever conquers, I will grant him to sit
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:20.360]   with me on my throne as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on His throne.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:29.200]   Isn't this an amazing promise that Jesus says, "Even though you've been unfaithful, even
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:37.480]   though you've been caught in idolatry possibly, I still will
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:42.300]   accept you if you conquer over your sin."
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:50.820]   And that's what Jesus is saying, that this church can sit with Jesus on His side.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:57.740]   What an amazing promise that we could be accepted by Jesus, that this church could be accepted,
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:01.600]   adopted by Jesus.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:08.080]   And so we see that this church in Laodicea, you know, there was a loveless church, there
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:12.260]   was a suffering church, as we see in the next slide, a worldly church.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:17.540]   Sardis was a spiritually dead church, Philadelphia was a spiritually alive church.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:23.500]   Laodicea was an ineffective and unfaithful church.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:29.920]   And Jesus is faithful, that this church was unfaithful.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:36.740]   And Jesus wanted this church to repent from conformity of the world and to be zealous
[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.780]   for Him.
[00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:46.620]   And could Jesus be saying the same thing to us today, as we see in the next slide?
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.780]   Could He be knocking on the door of our hearts?
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:56.980]   You know, it's amazing that this scripture was actually for Christians, right?
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.060]   "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.140]   I want to come in and eat with you."
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:10.040]   Church of Laodicea, I want to.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:19.660]   And yet this church was full of gold, or money, sorry, money and textiles and medicine, and
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.860]   they had no room for Jesus.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.700]   Could that be us today?
[00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:33.700]   That we've stuffed up ourselves with Netflix, stuffed up ourselves with food and the worldly
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:41.500]   things and education and money, and we've left no room for Jesus.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.740]   I studied economics and I want to maximize everything.
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:48.260]   I want to have, you know, all the nicest shoes and have Jesus.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.940]   I want to have all the best food in the world and have Jesus.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:27:00.820]   The thing is, I don't think we can have both.
[00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:04.020]   We can't serve two masters.
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:08.180]   Either we'll love one or hate the other.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:18.600]   And brothers and sisters, is it possible that we've gone the wrong way?
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:27.580]   We loved our position, our job, and we found our identity in our job and our work instead
[00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.740]   of our identity in Jesus.
[00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:34.420]   Could it be that we found our identity in school works and our grades instead of finding
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.740]   our identity in Jesus?
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:42.340]   Could it be that we found our identity in a prosperous, beautiful family instead of
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:47.080]   truly finding our identity in Jesus?
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:49.020]   Not that those things aren't important.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.300]   Not that God hasn't placed you, blessed you with those things.
[00:27:53.300 --> 00:28:00.140]   But is Jesus first in our lives?
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:06.380]   Last week, one student came to Titus, and he's been coming to church since he was a
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.140]   baby.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:14.020]   And he came to Titus for the first time and he shared about how his friend was going through
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:20.780]   suicide and he had to help him and convince him, you know, don't find your identity in
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.300]   your grades, you know.
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.620]   You can still overcome it.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:31.380]   And he was talking about how he had a broken relationship, he just going through a breakup.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.700]   And he opened up about that.
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:38.860]   And the Spirit led us to talk about how God can make a difference in his life, to heal
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:45.860]   his broken heart, to heal his friend and how God could use him and give him wisdom to heal
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.780]   his friend.
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:53.540]   And finally, we arrived at a point where I started to understand that he never placed
[00:28:53.540 --> 00:29:02.100]   his life into the hands of Jesus to let him to be the Lord and Savior of his life.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:07.220]   And so that night, I was like, you haven't asked Jesus to be the Lord and Savior of your
[00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.220]   life.
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.020]   You should do it now.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.380]   Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart.
[00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:19.460]   Yeah, it's taken out of context a little bit, that Jesus still uses that.
[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:26.580]   And I asked him, are you willing to now ask Jesus into your life to heal your brokenness,
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:32.900]   to give you wisdom, to give you direction in life, to give you a new purpose and a new
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:37.220]   identity and the Holy Spirit to guide you.
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:44.020]   And that night last week, he prayed the prayer and invited Jesus in.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:51.580]   And Jesus came in and ate with him and had fellowship with him.
[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:58.920]   The Church of Laodicea thought they did not need Jesus because they had it all.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:06.200]   Are we willing to repent of our own ways and ask Jesus to be the first priority in our
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:14.280]   life, to ask him to be the first love of our life?
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:20.000]   We're going to respond in a song called "Lord, I Need You."
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.080]   And that's the reality.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.360]   We all need Jesus.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:32.640]   Whether you're a pastor and you're going to church every day for work, or whether you
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:39.040]   just come once a week, we all need Jesus.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.160]   We're all broken.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.080]   We're all naked.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.960]   We're all poor.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:56.320]   We need Jesus to restore our relationship with him so that we can have a new identity,
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:02.640]   be clothed by Christ, be led by the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:09.960]   I pray for you that you would ask Jesus to be first in your life.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.960]   Let us pray.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:18.960]   Heavenly Father, bless us as we repent and surrender our lives to you.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.680]   Help us to know that we need you.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:27.760]   There's nothing in this world that can replace our relationship with you.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.760]   Humble us, Lord.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.760]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.260]   Amen.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.840]   (upbeat music)
