[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (Cantonese) Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   (Cantonese) We will continue to look at the "Tipsa Loriga" preface.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   (Cantonese) We have come to the fourth chapter.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   (Cantonese) I would like to ask you a question.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   (Cantonese) Maybe the reply is a bit scary.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   (Cantonese) But it's okay.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   (Cantonese) Okay, I will ask you a question.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   (Cantonese) I wonder if your parents have ever been on a trip,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   (Cantonese) when you were children.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   (Cantonese) What would they tell you when they were on a trip?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   (Cantonese) When they left you at home.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   (Cantonese) What would they tell you?
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   (Cantonese) Be good.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   (Cantonese) Be good.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   (Cantonese) When my mother was on a trip,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   (Cantonese) or when she went to work,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   (Cantonese) she would say, "Be good."
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   (Cantonese) If you think more closely,
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   (Cantonese) like when you go to VBS,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   (Cantonese) if you take your students to camp,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   (Cantonese) you may have to leave the room for a while,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   (Cantonese) what would you tell them?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   (Cantonese) Be good.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   (Cantonese) Actually, the "Tipsa Loriga" preface
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   is very similar to this.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Jesus had just left them,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   leaving behind a group of believers.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   But he promised that he would return.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   What do you think Jesus would tell them
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   after he left?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Or what would he tell the "Tipsa Loriga"
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   brothers and sisters?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   What would he tell them?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   He would tell them that he cared a lot
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   about the situation of the church at that time.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   What was the situation of the church at that time?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   The church was facing a very serious oppression.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Whether it was in the 17th chapter of the Book of Mormon,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   the Jews were angry at the Christians
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   for taking away their people
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   and not believing in Judaism anymore.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   So he persecuted them.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   The Romans also felt that these Christians
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   did not follow the laws of the Roman government,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   so he persecuted them.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   What was even worse was that
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   these believers, after following Jesus,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   their lives changed.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Because they were new believers,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   their habits changed
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   from what they were in the past.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   When they left their old lives,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   some people would think,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   "What's wrong? Why did you change?"
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So he began to persecute them.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   So the whole context of the "Tipsa Loriga" church
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   shows what was happening at that time.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   The first three chapters talk about trials,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   and you will be persecuted.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   The fourth chapter talks about temptations,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   and you will be persecuted.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   The fifth chapter talks about Jesus
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   coming back.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   In the whole "Tipsa Loriga" preface,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Jesus will come back is a very important message.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   From the first to the fifth chapter,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   each chapter reminds us
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   to look into the hope.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   No matter what happens,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   no matter the trials,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   no matter the temptations,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   you can be assured that
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Jesus will come back one day.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   This is a proof that Paul wants to give
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   to the "Tipsa Loriga" church.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So you all have to hold on.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You have to be obedient.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Today we will focus on the fourth chapter,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   the coming of the temptations.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I will read the "Tipsa Loriga" preface
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   from the first to the second chapter.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   It says,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   "We have come to you,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   "by Jesus Christ,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   "to ask you,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   "to urge you,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   "since you have received our teaching,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   "knowing how to act as men,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   "to receive the joy of God.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   "You have done just that.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   "I urge you to work harder.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   "You know what commandment we have given you
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   "by Jesus Christ."
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Paul tells the "Tipsa Loriga" church,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   "I am going to lay out some things
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   "to tell you how you can please God."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   In English, it is,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   "How to live in order to please God."
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   As a witness,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   there is a very common question
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I am often asked.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   How can I discern the will of God?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Pastor, please pray with me.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Please find the will of God with me.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I want to walk in God's will.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   How many of you
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   would like to walk in God's will?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Most of you.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I don't think I am raising my hand.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Most of you.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   You are all sitting here.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   You are all hoping to walk in God's will.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Whether you can do it is another matter.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   But I think the real question
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   that should be asked is,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   "How much do you really want to live in the will of God?"
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   How willing are you to follow God's commandment,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   even if this is not the most convenient
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   or the most comfortable?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Why do I need to talk about this?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Because Jesus,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   from the third chapter,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   says,
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   "It is God's will that you should be sanctified,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   that you should avoid sexual immorality,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   that each of you should learn to control your own body
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   in a way that is holy and honorable,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   not in passionate lusts like the pagans
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   who do not know God."
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Let me talk about this first.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   This is God's commandment.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Just now, everyone said
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   that they are willing to follow God's commandment.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   This is very clear.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   God's commandment is,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   "You should be sanctified,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   that you should avoid sexual immorality,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   that each of you should learn to control your own body
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   in a way that is holy and honorable,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   that each of you should learn to control your own body
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   and avoid sexual immorality."
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   In the Bible,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   not many places,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   or in the Old Testament,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   not many places directly say
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   that this is God's commandment.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   In the five chapters of the Old Testament,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   only four places say this.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   This is the first place.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   The other three places
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   are in the fifth chapter,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   the 16th to the 18th chapter.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   In fact, it is all in one paragraph.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   "You should be sanctified,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   that you should not commit adultery,
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   that you should be grateful for everything."
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Because this is God's commandment
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   to you in Christ Jesus.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   In fact, there are only four things.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   God clearly says,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   "This is my commandment."
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   First, avoid sexual immorality.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Second, be sanctified.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Third, not to commit adultery.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Fourth, be grateful for everything.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It is very clear.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   In many places in the Bible,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   some teachings
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   do not 100% list out
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   what you should do.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   We often need to continue to pray
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   to get the principles in the Bible
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   to let us know
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   how to apply God's commandment on earth.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   But this is very clear.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Paul says, "Avoid sexual immorality."
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   It is a direct commandment.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   If this is the case,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   the first question is,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   what is sexual immorality?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I don't know what you think.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   If we ask what sexual immorality is,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   maybe you are thinking of
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   some answers,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   like what you should not do,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   what you should not do,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   then it is already sexual immorality.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   If I look at it from another perspective,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   if I want to know what sexual immorality is,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   then we need to understand
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   how God defines sexual purity.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   What is the essence of sex in God?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   God's idea of sexual purity.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Faithfulness in marriage.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Loyalty in marriage.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Abstinence in singleness.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   In single life,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   you need to abstain.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   So, it means that
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   sexual relations
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   need to happen in marriage.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Sorry, I have to talk about sensitive topics today.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I will use some words that I have used before.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   You are all grown up.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   I am not afraid to say it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   So,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   sexual relations need to happen in marriage.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   You must be wondering
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   why it needs to happen in marriage.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   In Chinese,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   sexual relations,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   the original Chinese word for it is
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   "shakav",
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   which means "lie down".
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   "Lie down" means
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   two people trust each other to a certain extent.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   You lie down next to the other person
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   and put down all your prejudices.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   In this case,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   you are putting your most vulnerable side
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   in front of the other person.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   This is a very intimate moment.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   It needs protection.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Unless you know
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   you are under a protected environment,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   you cannot relax
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   and release your vigilance.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Marriage is a protection.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   In a marriage,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   you will tell the other person
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   "I give myself to you,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   and for the rest of our lives,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   we will serve and protect each other."
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   In a marriage like this,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   in a relationship like this,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   it is not possible to have a relationship
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   without a marriage.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   This is the original purpose
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   of the Bible,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   the original purpose of the Bible
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   for the Hebrews.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   The next question you will ask is
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   "In a marriage,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   you say that this kind of relationship
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   can only exist."
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   "If I am not married yet,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and I am not married yet,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   and I am not married yet,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   and I am not married yet,
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   and I am not married yet,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   will I be okay?"
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   In the Bible,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   this word is rarely used.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It is rarely used,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   "sexual intercourse."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   But it is used,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   "sexual intimacy."
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   In the third chapter of the book,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   we read Paul's words
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   about sexual intimacy.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   In the third chapter of the book,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   we read Paul's words about sexual intimacy.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   In the third chapter of the book,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   we read Paul's words about sexual intimacy.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   In fact, the Hebrew word "pornia"
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   In fact, the Hebrew word "pornia"
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   may sound like the English word
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   "pornography."
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   may sound like the English word
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   "pornography."
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   This is a very broad term
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   for the Hebrew word.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It is not just about one thing.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   This very broad term,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   "sexual intimacy,"
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   covers many aspects
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   of sexual sins.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   of sexual sins.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Therefore,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   the correct question is,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   if what you are doing
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   is considered
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   sexual intimacy,
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   sexual intimacy,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   if so,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   I won't count everything,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   it should be kept
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   within the boundaries of marriage.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   it should be kept within the boundaries of marriage.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Many times,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   we see God's
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   teaching on this
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   as a set of rules.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Therefore,
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   we try to ask
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   what the limit is.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   We try to push the limit.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   If you know the rules,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   the teacher may have set some rules
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   in the classroom,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   so don't make a fuss.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   So don't make a fuss.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Or, we like
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   to keep the rules
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   to the extreme
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   to the extreme
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   within the boundaries
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   and not to be punished.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   It is like
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   when I was driving in the US,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   the speed limit
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   was 70 miles per hour,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   was 70 miles per hour,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   per hour.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   But if you don't exceed
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   15,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   you won't be arrested.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   So most people,
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   even though they know the speed limit is 70,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   they still drive at 80 miles per hour
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   and don't exceed 85 miles per hour,
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   and they won't be arrested.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   If you know the rules,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   you will usually
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   try to push
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   the limit.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   So when you ask
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   if this is okay,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   you are thinking
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   how to push the limit
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   to the extreme
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   so that God won't punish me
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   or if he thinks
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   it is okay.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   But if
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   we look at God's laws
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   as
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   our advantage,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   would we have
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   a second thought?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   In the past,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   we might ask
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   what I can do to the best of my ability
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   to not violate God's laws.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   But actually,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   as a Christian,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   should we ask
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   how we can
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   get closer to Jesus
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   and make him happy?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I will give you an example.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Let's say I am a pastor
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   for 9 months.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   When I was
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   studying at the church,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   I would read
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   a lot of different books
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   and learn how to be a pastor.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   If I am
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   a wise person,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   I would not ask
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   how I can be a pastor
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   at the minimum.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Is it okay to be a pastor
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   if I am a good student?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Or should I learn
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   how to be a good pastor?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   How do they behave?
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   How do they talk to their sisters?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   How do they do their best
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   to learn the Bible
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   so that I can be
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   a better pastor?
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Or should I
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   barely
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   get a job
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   at the church?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   If you are
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   a pastor
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   and you want me to
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   do my best
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   to make myself
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   a better pastor,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   then
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   the same goes for God.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   The Bible
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   has a lot of rules
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   and a minimum
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   requirement.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   How far do we need to go?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   God does not want us
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   to meet the minimum.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   He wants us to use our lives
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   to glorify God
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   and to ask for His joy.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   How can we live out more of
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   God's ways
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   instead of meeting the minimum?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   If that is the case,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   then why
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   do we need to
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   avoid sexual sins?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   How do we see this
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   in God?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Let's read
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   from verse 6 to 8.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Let's read
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   in Chinese.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   1, 2, 3
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   "No man
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   should be in this world
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   taking advantage of his brother.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   For this kind of good
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   is a reward.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   As I have warned you
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   before,
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   God does not want
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   us to be
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   in the way of sin,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   but to make us
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   holy. Therefore,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   he who abhors the teaching of this
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   is not an abhorrent man,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   but an abhorrent one who
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   has his own spirit
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   in your hearts."
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   I think this is
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   one thing.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   God
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   wants us to be holy.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   He
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   bought us
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   with a heavy price.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   He wants us to
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   live out holiness.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   In verse 4 and 5,
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   we read
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   that Paul
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   specifically distinguished
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   the believers
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   from the unbelievers.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   The unbelievers
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   would not know
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   God's
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   law and standards.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   But the believers
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   clearly know that God
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   has told us how
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   we should live
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   lives of moral
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   sexual purity,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   how to control our bodies,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   how to be holy
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   and live honorably.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   This is God's instruction
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   and calling.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   He wants us to be holy.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   His heart
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   is doing this
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   for our own good.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   He doesn't want us to live a boring life
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   or a miserable life.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   He calls us
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   to be like God
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   because he wants us
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   to be like God.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Because he is holy.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Have you ever thought about
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   why
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   sexual immorality
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   would take
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   the brother's side?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Maybe you think,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   "We are not married.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   How can we
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   influence other brothers?"
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   "It's our own business."
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   But
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   the brother or sister
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   in your church
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   might marry
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   or marry someone
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   one day.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   When you do this
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   to them,
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   you are taking
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   the brother or sister's
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   side.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   You are taking
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   the brother's side.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   This is
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   a kind of love.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Not taking the brother's side
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   or loving the brother
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   or sister around you.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Although this person
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   might not appear yet,
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   bear that in mind.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   If you are not
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   in a relationship with
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   the person you are already married to,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   you are taking the brother's side.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   The Bible
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   clearly states
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   that such a person
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   will be punished.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Paul said, "I am warning you."
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Third,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   if
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   we don't avoid
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   the sin of sin,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   we are rejecting God.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Why?
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   In Columbus'
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   18-20,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   another book,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Paul clearly states
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   that we should avoid
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   the sin of sin.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   We should flee from
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   sexual immorality.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   We often wonder
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   whether sin is a big deal.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   We can talk more about this
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   later.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   But the sin of adultery
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   is a big deal.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   All the sins
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   mentioned in this book
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   are physical.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Only adultery
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   is harmful to our body.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   If you know
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   that we are God-fearing,
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   that the Holy Spirit lives in our body,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   when you harm your body
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   or let your body be unhealed,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   you are actually
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   persecuting God.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   You are sinning against God.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   What is God doing to our body?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   The Bible says
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   that God is
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   in your body.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   So why
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   God values sexual sins?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   We should avoid
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   sexual sins because they are God's
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   calling. He calls us to be holy.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   He calls us to be His followers.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   He calls us to be like Him.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Second, if we don't do this,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   we are taking advantage of
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   our brother.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Third, if we don't do this,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   we are actually
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   persecuting God.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Because the Holy Spirit lives in our body.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   It is in our body.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   It is in our body.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Practically,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   how can we
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   live out
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   this holiness?
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   [translation]
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   [translation in Cantonese]
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   "For this is the gospel, that you become holy, that you keep away from sexual immorality"
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   [translation in Cantonese]
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   [translation in Cantonese]
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   [translation in Cantonese]
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.540]   控制得到,唔緊要,行近啲條紅線都得
[00:21:55.540 --> 00:22:00.700]   我到最後嗰度唔做神話唔做嗰樣嘢就得㗎啦
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:06.120]   但係有時我哋真係會高估咗自己嘅能力
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.620]   之前喺美國可能都真係會喺教會實習啦
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.580]   都有啲人會同我分享點解
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.800]   有啲年青人同我分享點解會發生咗呢
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.560]   好多都係唔知點解會發生咗
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.320]   亦都唔係想發生但係就係發生咗,總之唔知點解
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.980]   咁我諗畀我一個提醒或者係畀我哋多一個提醒啦
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:32.560]   就係其實唔好高估咗自己嗰個嘅能力啦
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.360]   有一個嘅小故事啦就係
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:41.020]   喺一個有一個人就諗住去一個鄉村旅行啦
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.820]   咁佢個去個小村落呢就要經過一個山嘅
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.280]   而個山路呢就係好窄嘅
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:52.200]   咁佢就去嘗試去僱用一個的士司機啦
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.820]   邊個的士司機真係要最安全咁樣
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.700]   經過好窄嘅山路去到嗰條村莊啦
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:01.360]   咁佢就喺度問唔同嘅司機喺度等緊乘客嘛
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.740]   第一個司機就問你你你揸呢條山路嘅時候
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.820]   你可以揸成點樣呀
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.160]   司機一呢就話
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.780]   我可以離開個懸崖一呎都唔會跌落去嘅
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.360]   所以你放心啦你僱用我啦
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.080]   第二個司機就講啦
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.360]   我仲勁呀我可以離開個懸崖六呎呀
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.440]   六吋呀都唔會跌落去
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.360]   都可以安全咁樣將你去送抵達目的地
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.160]   司機三呢就話
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.360]   我仲勁我可以離個懸崖一吋
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.700]   都唔會跌落去將你送去目的地
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.700]   最後有個司機講話
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:52.700]   我會去嘗試每一分每一秒都係離開個懸崖越遠越好
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:58.700]   咁我唔知你係會揀邊個司機去車你去個小村莊呢
[00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:03.700]   一呎嗰個六吋一吋都唔會出事嗰個
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:08.700]   定話係佢每一分每一秒都係會離開個懸崖
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.700]   接住個山邊去揸車嗰個司機呢
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.700]   喺我哋嘅context裏面
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.700]   逃避又係指緊啲乜嘢呢
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:25.700]   你明知道如果有啲嘢係會arouse到你嘅
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.700]   你就唔好去接觸佢啦
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.700]   我知道而家喺你哋嘅世代裏面係好難
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.700]   或者我哋嘅世代啦
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.700]   其實我都會接觸到嘅
[00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.700]   我學校佢就教話而家嘅porn呢
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.700]   好容易接觸到嘅無論係刊物定話係一啲media嘅嘢
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.700]   佢話有四個a呀而家點解咁容易呢比起
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.700]   我嘅年代或者我爸爸媽媽年代更容易接觸到嘅
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.700]   佢話四個a喎因為而家係more acceptable
[00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.700]   即係好平常嘅呢啲接觸呢啲嘢
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.700]   接觸咗即係或者你做呢樣嘢其實都冇乜所謂啦
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.700]   第二個呢就係第二個a就係accessible
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.700]   好容易access到嘅以前可能我哋都要去買啲cd呀
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.700]   或者dvd咁樣你要去出街嘅咁但係而家其實
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.700]   撳一個掣你就會已經access到㗎啦
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.700]   第三個嘢就係more affordable其實而家係好平就可以接觸到㗎啦
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:24.700]   第四就係anonymous你接觸到都冇人知暗暗地做
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:29.700]   其實而家你哋嘅人有比起以前嘅人係更大嘅
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.700]   所以你要知道乜嘢會arouse到你嘅
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.700]   你就唔好去接近呢啲嘢啦
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:40.700]   如果係你喺一段嘅關係裏面
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   你避免即係兩個人係一個即係私人嘅空間裏面啦
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:52.700]   或者係即係你可以同啲其他一班嘅朋友出嚟啦
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.700]   就係囉避免兩個人喺個私人空間啦
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:26:01.700]   又或者係有即係一啲弟兄姊妹啦佢就話你去
[00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.700]   佢自己畀佢一個男仔嚟嘅佢就話平時
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.700]   佢讓我自己去健康啲啦去做多啲運動咁佢
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:15.700]   就可能唔會成日去諗呢一類嘅嘢啦
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.700]   如果喺一段關係裏面
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.700]   我唔知你可能會唔會去同你嗰個嘅
[00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.700]   Partner男女朋友去祈禱呢
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.700]   即係如果你每一次嘅約會完咗
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.700]   或者你每一次嘅傾電話完咗之後你去咁樣同佢一齊去祈禱啦
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:39.700]   我覺得係會係避免到呢一樣嘢嘅發生嘅
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:44.700]   之前有一個人就
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:53.700]   就有一次啦咁就畀咗條頸呢個啦
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.700]   就係一個十字架啦即係其實當你對方
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:04.700]   去帶住一個十字架頸鏈你對帶住十字架頸鏈佢又帶住十字架頸鏈嘅時候
[00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:09.700]   其實都係一個Reminder啦當你知道耶穌係喺呢個關係中間
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:14.700]   你就唔會去咁容易去行入呢啲嘅人有裏面啦
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.700]   最後就Irene牧師啦佢成日都話拍拖就要話畀佢聽
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.700]   咁呀所以你哋如果當中邊個即係係Explorer裏面拍拖啦你都可以話畀佢聽
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.700]   即係咁樣係有啲咩好處呢就係去Keep you accountable
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:33.700]   等牧者或者導師去知道你而家係一個Relationship裏面咁可能你都會有一個嘅警惕
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:38.700]   令到自己唔好去真係陷入喺呢啲嘅狀況裏面呀
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:45.700]   所以你可以去搵佢嘅到最後嘅一樣嘢啦
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.700]   真係想同大家分享就係其實有好多時呢我發現自己啦
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:58.700]   喺我嘅人生裏面通常我犯罪去Sin against God啦都係我想Please我自己多過去Please神
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:05.700]   而喺呢一段經文一開始就係我哋點樣可以行一個討神喜悅嘅修命呢
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:12.700]   可能你會覺得呢個教導真係好老土可能你會覺得過時可能你覺得唔明白或者唔同意
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:18.700]   但係你記得一樣嘢啦即係每一次你做一樣嘢嘅時候
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:24.700]   你係會想Please你自己多啲定Please神多啲呢
[00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:32.700]   其實神去設立一啲Standard畀我哋唔係想我哋唔開心唔係想我哋有個Miserable life
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.700]   而係佢知道呢一樣嘢係對我哋好
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.700]   雖然好多時我哋今日有啲嘢唔同意或者唔明白
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:46.700]   但係我都請你相信去遵從神同埋信佢係值得嘅
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:54.700]   因為神係我哋佢愛我哋佢知道比我哋更清楚知道乜嘢對我哋好
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:59.700]   而且佢心裏面時常都係有我哋嘅Best Interest喺度
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.700]   佢最清楚知道乜嘢我哋應該做同埋唔應該做
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:15.700]   所以今日即使你覺得係可能比較過時或者身邊嘅人覺得過時
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:26.700]   但係我哋做為一個群體都係去一齊去互相提醒大家去活出神嗰個嘅標準同埋佢嗰個嘅聖潔
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:33.700]   最後我知道今日講咗好多嘢啦即係關於Sexual Immorality 聖潔呢啲嘢
[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:42.700]   或者我哋當中有人可能都真係做過一啲嘢心裏面你覺得內疚或者唔開心
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:49.700]   但係我覺得今日都想同大家講即使係有啲嘢你發生過嘅
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:55.700]   即係神同你講佢明白 and it's okay
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:02.700]   你做過嘅所有嘢我有一句好鍾意就係佢話
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.700]   There is nothing you have done that can make God love you more
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:10.700]   And there is also nothing you have done that can make him love you less
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:16.700]   無論你今日去做過啲乜嘢唔會阻礙神愛你有幾多
[00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:21.700]   亦都唔會阻礙神喺你生命裏面嗰個嘅旨意
[00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:29.700]   不過今日無論係乜嘢嘅狀況我都好想你去我哋一齊去 come to God and say
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:37.700]   即使你做過啦真係神呀真係係我以前去可能得罪過你真係犯過罪
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:46.700]   但係今日我願意去將我嘅關係我所有嘅desires去畀你去管理
[00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.700]   求主你去 guard my heart and protect me
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:59.700]   今日就係我對大家嘅勉勵其實好多時大家都知道聖經上嘅教導
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:05.700]   不過就可能好難喺我哋呢個世界上面去行出嚟
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.700]   大神呼召我哋去成為聖傑亦都係同世界唔一樣
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:14.700]   所以我哋就一齊去咁樣去為神擺上
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:19.700]   咁樣去一齊去努力去活出一個神喜悅嘅生命
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.700]   我哋一齊祈禱
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.700]   青天賦滿力感謝你去用重價去買我哋
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:31.700]   呼召我哋出嚟去成為聖傑
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.700]   去 be separated from the world
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:39.700]   主呀呢個係一個嘅恩典主求你去讓我哋去睇你嘅 rules
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:45.700]   唔係一啲去令我哋去 miserable嘅事情
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:50.700]   或者係令到我哋 to have a boring life
[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.700]   但係呢個係神你係為著我哋嘅好處
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.700]   你比我哋更清楚明白乜嘢係對我哋好
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:02.700]   主呀就求你去讓我哋縱然可能有時有啲嘢唔同意
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.700]   或者縱然有時好多嘢唔明白
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.700]   但我哋都唔去懷疑你喺我哋生命裏面嗰份好
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.700]   你對我哋嘅旨意嗰個嘅好
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.700]   主呀都求你去幫助我哋 explore
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.700]   每一位都喺你裏面去活出聖結
[00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:20.700]   去過一個蒙你喜悅嘅生命
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:24.700]   主呀求你去真係去 guard our hearts
[00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:26.700]   同埋去 protect us from all the temptations
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.700]   In Jesus name we pray
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:29.700]   - Thank you.
