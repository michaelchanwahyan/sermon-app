[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.440]   My talk this evening as we kick off a brand new series is "Serving Satisfies Me."
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.680]   You're going to hear this next expression a lot.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.400]   I've put it on the screen.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.160]   Saved people serve people.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.920]   Let me repeat that.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.940]   Saved people serve people.
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:41.720]   You don't have to be saved to serve, but I maintain that you do have to serve if you
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.720]   are saved.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.400]   I'll tell you where I'm going with this.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.560]   January 7th, 2023 was a difficult day for me to preach my first sermon of the year here
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.200]   at KFCI.
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.560]   Firstly I was in the UK.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.080]   It was literally days after Sandra's father had died and we were busy clearing out his
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.000]   house and arranging the funeral.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.160]   My sermon was on video.
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.040]   I actually filmed it myself.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.080]   Bonnie tidied it up and added the slides.
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.720]   If you remember, God gave me, I believe, three words.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.200]   You remember this picture.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.560]   Us, you and them.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.120]   A reminder by us, I referred to the pastors of the church.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.880]   There is a call for us pastors to be ready for all that God wants us to do as a church.
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.520]   By you, I refer to the congregation of our churches.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.360]   That means recognising that all of you, all of you are gifted.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.760]   That means us equipping you.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:08.280]   That means proper training to allow you to be effective ministers of the gospel.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.840]   And by them, I refer to the community.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.280]   Those outside of our church buildings.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.880]   That means us being aware of the needs in our society.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.560]   That means us being willing to get up of our church seat and do something about it.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.400]   That means being trained and equipped to be able to do this effectively.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:45.240]   Now Gong Fuk Church's vision for 2023 is this, equipping the saints, serving the community.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.520]   Equipping the saints, serving the community.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.400]   In response to this, we launched a five-week sermon series on equipping the saints with
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.960]   Johnny, James, myself, and you remember Pastor Seth.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.280]   But we were only at half-time.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.400]   And the half-time refreshments, as it were, were the One Campaign and the Parables of
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.820]   Luke.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.800]   But the point is, it is good to be equipped.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.200]   Indeed, very good.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.320]   Indeed, essential.
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.600]   But only if equipping leads to service.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.280]   Only if equipping leads to service.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.680]   That is the 2023 vision of Gong Fuk Church.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.920]   And this is vital as we as a church, as the big church, make preparation for our Gong
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.480]   Fuk Community Centre and the exciting opportunities to serve Hong Kong people emanating from the
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.480]   Southern District.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.920]   And we'll be sharing more about this in the coming weeks and months.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:08.400]   But remember, save people, serve people.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:15.680]   And yet, many people talk about coming to church to be fed.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.900]   You've heard the expression.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.840]   They will feel they will be fully satisfied if they are fed.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   As I prayed this week, there's a picture on the screen.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.760]   I sense a picture of a hiker.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.560]   I think I was influenced by us being in Moi Wo last week for three days.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:46.240]   Now this hiker had a rucksack full of food and provisions for the hike.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:56.120]   But instead of that, he decided to eat and drink them before he started the walk.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:05.280]   He was more worried about being fed than about the purpose of his journey.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:15.520]   KFCI, church is not all about me.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.920]   Jesus didn't come to be served, but to serve.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:30.000]   When we follow Jesus as our leader and forgiver, we should serve others just as Jesus did.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.120]   After all, save people, serve people.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.720]   I told you to hear that a few more times.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.240]   Jesus was the ultimate example of service throughout his life.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.000]   And our response to his love and grace should be lives spent serving him.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.880]   I don't know about you, I find that I can twist the idea of service to be more about
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.840]   me than it is about the attitude of serving.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.600]   One of the things I've noticed about serving in our current culture is that we tend to
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.760]   have an approach that's really more about us than it is about who we're serving.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   It's not a great look.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   Let me explain.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.880]   I've put the headline up, "Selfish Serving."
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.240]   Often the narrative in my mind goes something like this, "I can't serve because I don't
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.320]   have the time.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.520]   I don't know how to serve them.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.720]   It's difficult.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.000]   It's uncomfortable.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.280]   I don't like doing it.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.720]   I'm really tired.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.440]   I don't think I have the energy to do this and that."
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.720]   The problem with all of those statements is those statements are about me and what I get
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.640]   out of the act of serving.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.440]   It's a backwards relationship.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.880]   Ultimately, serving should be a sacrifice.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:12.360]   When serving is not a sacrifice, is it really serving?
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.000]   Is it really satisfying?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.340]   We're going to talk tonight about serving the Lord Jesus Christ as a person saved from
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:32.800]   our sins by his blood, as a person filled with his life-giving spirit as being fully
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.800]   satisfying.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:40.900]   I want to look at a few verses from a famous story in John 4.
[00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.320]   We know it as Jesus and the woman at the well.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:52.440]   The background we read is that Jesus was tired.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.600]   He was fully human and he sat down by a well.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:07.540]   We read, "When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, 'Will you give me
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.580]   a drink?'"
[00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.260]   Now this was all wrong.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:23.580]   Jesus, a Jewish man, talking to a Samaritan, talking to a Samaritan woman, talking to a
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:31.620]   Samaritan woman with a past, talking to a Samaritan woman with a past who was there
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:40.820]   in the midday to probably avoid being seen by the village gossips.
[00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:47.220]   But you know it was not about a drink he needed.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:52.320]   It was all about what she needed.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:57.360]   We then witness a most, I can only say, a bizarre conversation about a drink that Jesus
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.940]   didn't really want from a woman who didn't think he should be asking her, leading to
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.700]   a discussion which interplays between the water from the well and this thing called
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.120]   living water.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:17.020]   She says, "I don't know what this living water is, but it sounds like I should have some."
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.260]   Let's read a few verses.
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:26.540]   The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw water with and the well is deep.
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.460]   Where do you get that living water?
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.180]   Are you greater than our father Jacob?
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:36.580]   He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock."
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:45.620]   Jesus said to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:51.240]   drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again.
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:58.260]   The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.260]   life."
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:10.620]   I guess what I'm saying is that the spring of water welling up to eternal life has to
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.900]   result in three key things.
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.340]   Firstly, it needs to result in love.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:23.260]   The Bible tells us, doesn't it, you should love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:28.780]   your soul, and all your mind, and wait for it, and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:36.060]   It has to result in growth.
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:40.860]   Through all the things that we spoke about in January, remember unity, community, word
[00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:49.180]   and witness, and last but not least, it has to result in action.
[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:56.860]   Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these, my brothers, you did it
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.860]   to me.
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.860]   You did it to me.
[00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.580]   Yes, save people, serve people.
[00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:09.540]   Jesus said that if she drank the water from the well, she would be thirsty again in no
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:16.060]   time, especially in the midday humidity, and we knew that today in Hong Kong, didn't we?
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:24.020]   But Jesus said if she drank this living water, she would never go thirsty again.
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:31.300]   No wonder she ran to the city and proclaimed to them, "Come and see a man.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:36.180]   Could this be the Christ?"
[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.140]   This leads me to the passage that Bonnie read earlier.
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.460]   We know it as the feeding of the 5,000.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:49.400]   It's actually the only miracle that is recorded in all four Gospels.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:56.260]   But the custom of the time was to count heads of household, and Scripture tells us there
[00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.780]   were 5,000 men with additional women and children.
[00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:06.420]   So the final tally could be closer to 15,000 or even more.
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:14.980]   It is Mark 6, 13 to 44, and begins with the disciples returning from a mission trip and
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:15.980]   giving a report.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:21.260]   I know Johnny will be taking a team off to Cambodia in a couple of weeks' time, and one
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:26.380]   of the highlights of the mission trip is when they come back with their report, right?
[00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.660]   What happened?
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:33.500]   We read in verse 30, "The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all they had done and
[00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.940]   taught."
[00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:42.540]   So many people were coming and going as a direct result of this outreach.
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:49.420]   Many had been saved, many had been healed, that Jesus said, "Come away by yourselves
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.620]   to a desolate place and rest for a while."
[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:59.780]   For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:05.380]   It must have seemed like paradise to the disciples, you know, down time after a mission trip.
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.940]   You know what it's like, right?
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.340]   I understand this.
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:14.940]   You put your feet up and at last can have a sleep.
[00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:22.740]   But the crowd just grew and grew and grew.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.180]   The disciples weren't worried at first.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.140]   They were resting on the boat.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.940]   They were ready for 40 winks.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.780]   But hold on, verse 32.
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:39.060]   "And they went away into a boat to a desolate place by themselves.
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.860]   Now many saw them going and recognized them.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.540]   And they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them."
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.540]   Uh-oh.
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.900]   Now read on.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:59.100]   "When he went ashore, he saw a great crowd and he had compassion on them because they
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.140]   were like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:05.460]   And he began to teach them many things.
[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:11.260]   And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, 'This is a desolate place
[00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.980]   and the hour is now late.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.620]   Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.540]   something to eat.'"
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:27.980]   Now there is an interesting Greek word that is used here for compassion.
[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.980]   I love this word.
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.140]   Splagnitzai.
[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:40.020]   It literally means to be moved as to one's bowels.
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.380]   A compassion in the most innermost place in my gut.
[00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:50.980]   The only time it's used in scripture other than regarding Jesus was the Good Samaritan.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.340]   The disciples were thinking, "What a time!
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.220]   Jesus, what a time to have Splagnitzai!"
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:02.060]   Now wait for it.
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.860]   It gets worse.
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:09.140]   "But he answered them, 'You!
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:12.140]   You give them something to eat!'"
[00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.740]   Now on the face of it, the disciples' requests had been reasonable.
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.740]   They were tired.
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:22.100]   They were in a desolate spot.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.740]   There was no Fairwoods or McDonald's there.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:32.100]   Notice I didn't use KFC for obvious reasons.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:40.860]   It was dark and the crowd was staying as long as Jesus was preaching.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:47.740]   It sounded sensible and reasonable to stop the teaching and send them off for food in
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.580]   a nearby village.
[00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:53.620]   Reasonable.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:59.260]   But Jesus' response sounded anything other than reasonable.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.180]   He said, "You!
[00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.500]   You give them something to eat!"
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.740]   Prompting the disciples' somewhat sarcastic response.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:17.220]   "Should we go and buy 200 denarii of worth of bread and give them to eat?
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.340]   That's half a year's wages!
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:26.420]   You want us to spend that much on bread for the crowd?"
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.140]   Then look at this.
[00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.140]   It's on the screen.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.620]   He said to them, "How many loaves do you have?
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.580]   Go and see."
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:40.540]   And when they found out, they said, "Five and two small fish."
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:45.300]   Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:51.260]   They sat in groups by hundreds and by fifties and taking the five loaves and the two fish,
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:56.300]   he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.260]   disciples to set before the people.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.300]   And he divided the two fish among them all.
[00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.620]   And they all ate and were satisfied.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:15.460]   And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.
[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.980]   I guess it's fish pie tomorrow, right?
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:23.220]   And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.220]   Now some points here.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.220]   It's a familiar story, I know.
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.620]   But at the same time, there's some lessons here about serving.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.220]   Number one is this.
[00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.040]   Everyone is hungry.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.420]   In this story, the disciples were hungry.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.940]   They had no leisure even to eat.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.940]   The crowd were hungry.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:48.020]   He said, "Send them away into the surrounding countryside to buy themselves something to
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:50.580]   eat."
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:56.620]   Hunger here equates to lack of satisfaction.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.860]   The crowd have left their home.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:07.640]   They've left their food on the shelves because of Jesus.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.720]   He was preaching.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.000]   He was teaching.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.120]   He was healing.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:22.620]   The crowd had skipped meals because they were hungry for Jesus.
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.280]   They could go for days.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.840]   Even the last month or so, we've seen congregations in places like Asbury just going on for days.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.560]   Just because they were hungry for Jesus.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:44.640]   God has created a hunger, a hungry man that only he can fill.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:51.680]   So everyone is hungry, especially Johnny, by the way.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:57.160]   Second point is you are invited to a miracle.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.640]   You're invited to a miracle when you serve the Lord.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:07.960]   You get front row seats to see unmet needs met by Jesus.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.720]   This is grace.
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:18.820]   Verse 37, Jesus said, "You give them something to eat."
[00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:22.800]   This was a bit like our schedules here in Hong Kong.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.200]   The disciples were maxed out.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:34.000]   People in Hong Kong are so busy.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:41.240]   People wear their busyness like a badge.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.200]   I often ask people, "How are you?"
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.200]   You know what they reply?
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.880]   "I'm busy."
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.400]   Not the question.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:59.800]   We can be so busy that we can miss the miracle.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.240]   My third point is really three words.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.440]   Blessed, broken, and given away.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.200]   They're all in one verse here.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.240]   They find the little that they have.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.880]   In this case, it was five loaves and two small fish.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.120]   I want to read it again.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.640]   And taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:26.560]   and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.000]   And he divided the two fish amongst them.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.400]   This represents for us a pattern of what he does for us.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.920]   You say to me, "Pastor John, I've so little to offer.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.280]   I can't sing, play music.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.560]   I've never preached a sermon.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.480]   I've never led anyone to Christ."
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.400]   Well, I've got news for you today.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:21:00.680]   Just as Jesus used a little boy's packed lunch to feed the multitudes with baskets left over,
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:09.360]   you offer him what you have and he will bless, break, and give away.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.040]   Let's look at those three.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.720]   Bless.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.320]   Jesus blessed the bread.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.080]   We read that.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:21.000]   Jesus blesses us.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.480]   Breaks.
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.720]   This is so important.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:29.440]   Jesus broke the bread.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.080]   Jesus breaks us.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:39.000]   This is very hard, but so important that Jesus breaks us so that we're ready to be given
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   out.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.240]   And then thirdly, he gives away.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.960]   Jesus gave the bread to his disciples.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:52.400]   He will use us to feed the multitudes with his love.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.940]   Can I just expand that broken bit for a moment?
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.040]   As I said earlier, God breaks things in our lives.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:04.440]   We all have things that God needs to break in our lives.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:09.740]   Attitudes, bad habits, secret sins.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.460]   But he also breaks our heart for things.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.720]   What breaks your heart may be different to the things that break my heart.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:26.240]   Don't we sing, "Break my heart for what breaks yours, Jesus."
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:40.320]   But when your heart breaks for them, it invariably means that Jesus wants you to do something.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:47.740]   You'll have the privilege over the next few weeks to hear people who God has broken their
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:53.600]   hearts for the poor, for refugees, for those who are without sight, for the orphan and
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.100]   the unborn child.
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.060]   I'll tell you more in a moment.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:04.900]   God is not looking for your excuses.
[00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:13.900]   I believe for everyone that's here, God wants to do something extraordinary in your lives.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:28.420]   He wants you to offer him your ordinary.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:35.820]   He will add his extra and make it extraordinary.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.500]   I've put it on the screen.
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:48.960]   He takes our ordinary, he gives the extra, and he makes it extraordinary.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:59.120]   My friend, over the next two months, and obviously after that as well, we want to encourage you
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:06.000]   to give what is ordinary for you.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.200]   This is what we have in store for you.
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.680]   I've put the schedule up.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:16.560]   What we'll be doing is this, is that every other week I'll be sharing from this series,
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.560]   and the intervening weeks we'll have some champions here.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:28.800]   Next week, my birthday party week, just saying, we'll have Dr. Susanna Hoy from the Hong Kong
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.000]   Christian Network for the Poor.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.020]   Those of you who don't know her, Pastor Peter is part of their advisory board.
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:42.080]   It's going to be a real treat for us to hear Susanna here next week.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.320]   In three weeks' time, we have Green Matonga from Branches of Hope.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.400]   She's working with the refugee and asylum seeker program there.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.560]   Again, someone we as a church support.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:59.840]   In five weeks' time, we're having Joyce from New Sight in Congo, just to have a look at
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.680]   what happens when we look at people who've, she's a Hong Kong lady and she's gone overseas
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:10.000]   to Congo, and she's dealing with people who have no sight in Congo.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.960]   That's going to be quite incredible.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.800]   And then lastly, Ali Amarwa, heirs from Mother's Choice, is going to be talking about the unborn
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:21.280]   baby and the orphans.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:31.640]   Each champion will come and will be sharing ways that we can be involved practically.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.280]   But I hear you say, "How do I get started?"
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:40.720]   Well, it's as simple as one, two, three.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.080]   Number one, start where you are.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.480]   Let me give you a place to begin.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.760]   It starts where you are.
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.760]   Pick one household.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:58.360]   I use the term household because I want you to think beyond just one person.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.320]   This might be a co-worker.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.400]   It might be another student in class, maybe someone or a family that lives in our apartment
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.600]   building.
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:14.960]   Just pick one household of someone disconnected from a church and where you see a need that
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.960]   can be served.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:23.800]   Remember, we're talking about five loaves and two fish, something small.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.880]   Don't wait passively for someone else's need to drop into your lap.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:39.680]   Make an intentional decision tonight to pick one household of someone you know who is disconnected
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.100]   from a church.
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.160]   It starts there.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.440]   Number two, pray for opportunity.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:54.600]   Start regularly bringing the person or people of this one household before God in prayer.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:59.680]   Remember, during Lent we started off the prayer for all, praying for five people.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.600]   Continue to do that.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.960]   Find someone who is on your heart.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.120]   Continually pray for them.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:12.560]   Particularly be praying for an opportunity to surface where you can serve the needs of
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.000]   this household.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.720]   You're just praying for an opening to get into this person's life in a way that can
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   help.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   That's all.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:28.680]   Thirdly, and this is important, pursue relationship.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:35.280]   However God answers that prayer for an opportunity to serve the needs of someone else in my community,
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.520]   take that as an opportunity for relationship.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.160]   I've said this before about serving others.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:50.920]   Nobody wants to be treated as a project.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:56.120]   They want to be acknowledged as a person.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:05.920]   You look for ways to bridge your actions of service into moments of relationship.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:08.920]   Pursuing relationship communicates something.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:16.080]   It tells someone else that they matter to you.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:24.360]   In pursuing a relationship, I open the door for sharing to someone else that God loves
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:29.800]   them and that they matter to God.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:36.320]   Because I love God, they matter to me too.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.080]   God himself has provided all we need to follow him.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:47.480]   He has revealed himself to us through his word so that we can know God and we can love
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.680]   God.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:55.040]   He has established his church as a place in which we grow relationships of accountability
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.560]   to hold one another up in faith.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.720]   And he has placed before us opportunities to meet the needs of those in our community
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:10.760]   so that we can share God's love and grace.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.800]   Yes.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.960]   Save people.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.720]   Love people.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.160]   But can I finish with a word of caution?
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.440]   Can I finish with a word of warning?
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:32.320]   Doing a sermon series on serving will not make us a serving church.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:39.440]   Having guest speakers will not suddenly make us a serving church.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:48.440]   Having a community centre does not suddenly make us a serving church.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:56.680]   What we need, and we need it desperately, we need a culture shift.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:02.400]   As I look out on this congregation, what we need to move away from is the same people
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.680]   who volunteer for everything while everyone else looks on.
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.960]   I'll say that again.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.160]   I mean it when we ask for volunteers.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:17.240]   We get volunteers but it's the same people.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.320]   I want to give you a spoiler alert.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.120]   How about that?
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:29.760]   Next week we will be sharing some simple opportunities for service.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.760]   Nothing difficult.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:34.320]   We'll be sharing.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:37.360]   What I'm expecting is this.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:42.240]   I'm expecting all of you to sign up.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:49.360]   Yes, all of you.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.440]   As you can tell, I'm restless about this.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:01.040]   I am passionate for long-term change.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:13.000]   As I ask the band to join me, we're going to be singing "There Must Be More Than This".
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.040]   And my friends, there is.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:24.640]   And we are going to discover this together.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:33.840]   My question is, will you join me on this journey?
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.480]   Let's please stand.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:44.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
