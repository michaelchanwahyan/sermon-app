1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - Amazing.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,160
 And I'm so excited about this new series,

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,440
 Women of the Old Testament.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,700
 Do you know this will be our first thematic series

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,280
 since I think 2018,

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,680
 after a good number of Old Testament

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,640
 and New Testament books.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,140
 I have to be honest with you,

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,140
 this has not come out of any deep spiritual revelation.

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,080
 But it occurred to me one morning in prayer

11
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,480
 that a good number of women

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,520
 have helped to shape biblical history.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,880
 At a time in history,

14
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,780
 when they were culturally not regarded in their own right.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,560
 Although the world has somewhat addressed these

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,120
 over the ensuing thousands of years,

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,640
 it is still held today in many cultures.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,160
 And the church has not been immune to this

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,600
 with the reality of women in church

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,940
 were often restricted to being Sunday school teachers,

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,560
 piano players and organising bake sales.

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,940
 Now, indeed, I helped write a book last year.

23
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,800
 It was called "Disruptive Women" by Letitia Shelton.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,320
 And I was probably inspired by this in choosing this series.

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,380
 In my chapter, I admitted that I had made some

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,560
 wrong decisions in my time based on gender.

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,940
 One example I quoted was instead of appointing

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,740
 a woman elder and Derek would know this story,

29
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,920
 a woman elder who was obviously gifted for the job,

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,360
 I appointed her husband instead.

31
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,000
 And even today we see so much of the church

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 seemingly not appointing women to primary roles.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,300
 I praise God for our female pastors, deacons

34
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,980
 and leaders at this church.

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,420
 Can I hear amen to that?

36
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,540
 But I wanna do something a little bit different,

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,240
 a little bit serious for a moment.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:28,660
 I wanna repent on behalf of the masculine portion

39
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:36,600
 of the worldwide church for 2000 years of behaviour

40
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,300
 bordering on misogyny.

41
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,040
 And can I, on behalf of those men,

42
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,640
 speak to you here tonight who are ladies?

43
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,760
 And can I ask you to forgive us,

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,660
 forgive us for the way that women have been treated

45
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,520
 in the church.

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,980
 We have not given you the respect

47
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,060
 and the authority that you deserve.

48
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,660
 We've put you down there instead of on an evil level

49
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,680
 with us men.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,620
 So would you please find it in your heart

51
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,500
 to forgive us for 2000 years of wrong.

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,020
 Now having got that off my chest,

53
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,120
 it makes me even more pleased to introduce this series.

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,180
 Now don't get me wrong,

55
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,380
 there were many great men in the Bible,

56
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,840
 perhaps a future series.

57
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,720
 But I believe that all of you will be blessed

58
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,360
 by this nine week series.

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,920
 Each of these women, you'll see the names on the screen,

60
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,180
 has a unique position in the framing

61
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,980
 of the story of scripture.

62
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,400
 And if we look into scripture, Rahab, Ruth,

63
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,160
 Bathsheba, admittedly Bill as Uriah's wife,

64
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,380
 and Tamar appear in the genealogy of Jesus

65
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,980
 in Matthew chapter one.

66
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,280
 Check it out when you get home.

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,320
 Now this is contrasted to Luke chapter one.

68
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,160
 His genealogy is 100% male.

69
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,540
 And what I found was that most of the women on the list

70
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,540
 are set apart by their willingness to be used by God,

71
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,640
 even when it was not easy or convenient.

72
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,120
 And that represents a huge lesson to all of us.

73
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,640
 I'm so pleased that Julian will be joining

74
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,440
 our preaching team for this series.

75
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,160
 And he will be preaching next week.

76
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,360
 Let's hear it for Julian.

77
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,200
 You might as well give him the round of applause now

78
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,040
 because you might not give him

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,960
 the round of applause afterwards.

80
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
 I'm just gonna say it, right, thank you.

81
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,840
 Now what this says, that this reaffirms our commitment

82
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,840
 as a church to the next generation.

83
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,440
 And I wanna start this evening by asking a question.

84
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,420
 Who is the most beautiful woman who ever lived?

85
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,840
 She's listening on YouTube actually.

86
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,440
 You wanna say it to the YouTube?

87
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,680
 We did a straw poll in the office.

88
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,880
 The most popular answer was my mum.

89
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,240
 I mean, not my mum, but my mum, you know.

90
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,400
 I'm always one for a little bit of a jerk.

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,300
 So I said JLo, Jennifer Lopez, but not really.

92
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,440
 A few of us were a bit more classical.

93
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,940
 And so we had answers like Helen of Troy or Cleopatra.

94
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,480
 And then others were a bit more spiritual.

95
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,200
 And we had a variety of biblical suggestions

96
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,400
 such as Mary, the mother of Jesus.

97
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,160
 But my friends, the answer is obvious.

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:27,240
 Eve, the most beautiful woman who ever lived.

99
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,240
 My goodness, that's a sweeping statement.

100
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,120
 I've got to justify it now.

101
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,040
 Why obvious?

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,820
 Eve was formed by God himself.

103
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,720
 She was formed from Adam's rib.

104
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,360
 I know we get the first joke.

105
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,480
 What was the first takeaway in the Bible?

106
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,600
 An order of spare ribs.

107
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,040
 I know where that comes from.

108
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:58,520
 But the key is this, that she was created before sin.

109
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,180
 Before sin had marred, had disfigured humankind.

110
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:11,040
 God had decided in Genesis 2, verse 18, an important verse.

111
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,840
 The Lord God said, "It is not good for man to be alone."

112
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,360
 Who says amen to that?

113
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,080
 "It is not good for man to be alone.

114
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,300
 I will make a suitable helper for him."

115
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,840
 Now be careful, in Hong Kong we have helpers.

116
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,600
 This does not mean I will make someone

117
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,200
 to cook his breakfast, right?

118
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,560
 Helper in the Old Testament,

119
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,520
 the word helper is used other than this about God.

120
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,600
 God is our helper.

121
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,280
 And what God was saying, I will make someone like myself

122
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,780
 who will be not an assistant, but a compliment.

123
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,800
 Let's read it in Genesis 2.

124
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,880
 Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground

125
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,400
 all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky.

126
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,020
 He brought them to the man to see what he would name them.

127
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,680
 And whatever the man called each living creature,

128
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,360
 that was his name.

129
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,360
 So the man gave names to all the livestock,

130
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,360
 the birds in the sky and the wild animals and the mosquitoes.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 But for Adam, no suitable helper was found.

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,240
 So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep.

133
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,960
 And while he was sleeping, he took one of the man's ribs

134
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,480
 and then closed up the place with flesh.

135
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,600
 Then the Lord God made a woman

136
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,160
 from the rib he had taken out of the man.

137
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,800
 And he brought her to the man.

138
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,460
 The man said, this is now bone of my bones,

139
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,040
 flesh of my flesh.

140
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,040
 She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man.

141
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,600
 That is why a man leaves his father and mother

142
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,640
 and is united to his wife and they become one flesh.

143
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,480
 Adam and his wife were both naked

144
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,340
 and they felt no shame.

145
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,960
 I wanna pause on that for a moment

146
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,880
 on their naked and unashamedness.

147
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,300
 And the Hebrew word alumin, I've put it on the screen.

148
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,080
 Let's repeat that all together, shall we?

149
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,600
 One, two, three, alumin.

150
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,200
 Store that one for a moment.

151
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,040
 Eve was a wonderful, wonderful woman.

152
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,380
 She was indeed the mother of the human race,

153
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,120
 the first mother.

154
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,160
 Eve means mother of life, mother of all who have life.

155
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,080
 We have here the creation of Eve,

156
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:12,080
 the fact that God made her directly from his own hand.

157
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,860
 Woman came out of man.

158
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,860
 God created Adam, then God created out of Adam, Eve.

159
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,700
 Adam was the first one who came into the world.

160
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,460
 We read in 1 Timothy 2,

161
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,460
 for Adam was formed first, then Eve.

162
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,820
 And Adam was not the one deceived.

163
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:42,220
 It was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner.

164
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,940
 So Adam was created first.

165
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,820
 That does not mean that woman is inferior to man.

166
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,620
 It simply means the place that God has given her.

167
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,700
 And this is important.

168
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,500
 It's wonderful to know,

169
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,500
 to realise the position that God has given us.

170
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,140
 This is something we all must learn.

171
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,620
 It is not only true of man and woman,

172
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,860
 but of every phase in life.

173
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,860
 We must realise that God is operating in our lives

174
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,860
 and that he has a plan for our lives.

175
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,140
 And we must co-operate with God

176
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,140
 or things will be destructive for us.

177
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:31,580
 The first thing we read about Eve

178
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,260
 is that she was created from man.

179
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,300
 She came from man.

180
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,300
 God took a portion, a part of man and built it into a woman.

181
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,940
 The passage here reads, I'll read it again.

182
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,060
 "The Lord made a woman from the rib

183
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,820
 he had taken out of the man,

184
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,140
 and he brought her to the man."

185
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,560
 Literally, it says he built her into a woman.

186
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:04,580
 Secondly, woman is the creation of God.

187
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:10,820
 Woman existed in the councils of God,

188
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,740
 the plan of God, the thinking of God

189
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,180
 before God ever made her.

190
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,220
 Adam was in the mind of God before God ever made him.

191
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,020
 God conceived him.

192
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,380
 God was the great architect of the universe

193
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,460
 and of all things and of man.

194
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,540
 We read in Hebrews chapter 11 of a city

195
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,860
 that God is building,

196
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,380
 a city whose architect and builder is God.

197
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,820
 God is an architect and yet God is a builder.

198
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,660
 Not only of a city, but of all things

199
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,460
 and of the human body and of human life.

200
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,620
 God is the architect and God is the builder.

201
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,620
 And so he performed an operation on Adam,

202
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,260
 a divine operation,

203
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,940
 just as a doctor performs an operation on a body,

204
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,180
 removes an organ or a bone.

205
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,500
 So woman was in the plan of God,

206
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,740
 even as man was in the plan of God.

207
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,620
 The sexes were a plan of God.

208
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,260
 There is a rightness in the sexes

209
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,820
 that is in the plan of God.

210
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,620
 And when that plan of God is violated

211
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,340
 and wrongness comes in, there is trouble.

212
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,820
 Now, an interesting thing about Eve's creation

213
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,780
 is that here is a woman who never was a baby,

214
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,660
 never was a young child,

215
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,340
 never was a daughter growing up.

216
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,180
 When God created her, she just stood forth perfect,

217
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,380
 full blown mature in all her beauty.

218
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,940
 Adam was mature and God made for Adam a helpmate.

219
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:16,540
 He wouldn't give Adam an infant to be his helpmate.

220
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,340
 Adam had no boyhood, childhood, no youth.

221
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,980
 He was created mature, perfect from the start.

222
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:30,260
 Friends, this world did not just evolve.

223
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,060
 It was not a big bang.

224
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,780
 The world was created.

225
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:44,700
 And as Christians, we believe it was created by our God.

226
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,700
 You cannot get around the story in Genesis

227
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,900
 to save your life.

228
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:59,300
 God created man perfect, mature, cultured, intelligent,

229
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,980
 and with knowledge.

230
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,980
 God created man perfect in the beginning.

231
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,540
 God created woman perfect in the beginning.

232
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,900
 Perfect womanhood.

233
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:21,020
 That was our Eve.

234
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:27,140
 God made her for his own hand and presented her to the man.

235
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,820
 Another thing we see here is that God created Eve

236
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,220
 for a purpose, to be a helpmate for the man.

237
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:41,820
 Verse 20, "But for Adam, no suitable helper was found."

238
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,300
 That means that man is not complete without woman

239
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,900
 and woman is the complement of man.

240
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,700
 And she is not complete without man.

241
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,460
 They need each other.

242
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,580
 Eve was evidently one of the most beautiful persons

243
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,940
 of all time because she was created by God's own hand.

244
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,380
 And God says in his word,

245
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,180
 he made everything beautiful in its day.

246
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:19,500
 If any woman is beautiful today in physical beauty,

247
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,420
 when it is marred by sin,

248
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,020
 if any man is handsome today in physical beauty,

249
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,060
 when it is marred by sin,

250
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:30,740
 what must have been the handsomeness and the beauty

251
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,820
 of Adam and Eve before sin came in?

252
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,780
 They were created absolutely perfect.

253
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,820
 They were created beautiful beyond words.

254
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,940
 There was no knowledge of sin.

255
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,700
 Therefore, absolute beauty back in the beginning.

256
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,940
 So Eve must have been the most beautiful woman

257
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,740
 who ever lived, created by God.

258
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,380
 God cannot make anything ugly.

259
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,180
 Ugliness is the result of sin.

260
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:16,340
 All the original creation was absolutely beautiful.

261
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,620
 And my friends in heaven,

262
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,060
 there will only be beauty.

263
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:30,260
 The bodies God is going to give us in heaven

264
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,740
 will be beautiful.

265
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,260
 I say, amen to that.

266
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:42,060
 They will be divinely given,

267
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,980
 fresh from the hands of God.

268
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,820
 Men who do not have physical handsomeness

269
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,540
 will be handsome there.

270
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,740
 I say, amen.

271
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,300
 Women who don't have physical beauty will be beautiful

272
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,780
 in the presence of God.

273
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:01,060
 Eternal beauty will not be achieved by dieting

274
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,300
 and cosmetics and so on.

275
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,020
 The other day on television,

276
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,260
 it was a lady who was famous

277
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,700
 in the silent films of years ago.

278
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,820
 They called her a woman of eternal youth

279
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:22,020
 because she has taken care of her appearance

280
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,220
 in a careful way.

281
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:29,300
 But you know, she is not now what she was.

282
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,860
 The seeds of death are there.

283
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,740
 No matter how much a person diets

284
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,940
 and keeps away wrinkles and takes hormones

285
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,940
 and the rest of it, physical beauty fades.

286
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,100
 I'm a good example.

287
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:52,220
 It is under the sentence of death.

288
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:58,140
 The most beautiful face will become faded, aligned.

289
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:04,340
 The most handsome face will become marked with old age.

290
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,860
 But my friends, isn't it wonderful

291
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,740
 to anticipate eternal beauty?

292
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,180
 Yes, the day is coming when God will give us new bodies

293
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,900
 and they will remain beautiful throughout all eternity.

294
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:26,940
 So here was undoubtedly

295
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,300
 the most beautiful woman who ever lived.

296
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,500
 Eve, the mother of all living,

297
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,020
 resplendent in all her beauty before Adam,

298
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,660
 fresh from the hand of a creator with no sin, no sorrow,

299
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,980
 nothing but love, peace and joy.

300
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:51,020
 There they stood, perfect,

301
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:56,980
 sinless before their maker, innocent.

302
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,900
 Isn't that a beautiful picture?

303
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,460
 The sweet thing to me, friends, is this.

304
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,460
 We too shall be perfect and sinless over on the other side.

305
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:17,740
 I wouldn't miss it for anything in the world.

306
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,660
 And we sang it, we celebrated it.

307
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,020
 Jesus died to purchase it for us.

308
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,220
 Jesus died not just to save us from hell.

309
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,100
 His work was not only redemptive, it was restorative.

310
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:39,260
 His deliverance will include redemption for the body.

311
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,540
 What a wonderful word that is in Romans 8,

312
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,500
 I'll put it on the screen,

313
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,180
 waiting for the redemption of the body,

314
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,180
 eager for that perfect state that Adam and Eve enjoyed.

315
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:02,060
 Eve was the most beautiful woman the world has ever known.

316
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,180
 And I wanna return to this voice.

317
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,540
 Can you remember the Hebrew word I asked you to store?

318
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,380
 Alhumim.

319
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:17,860
 Adam and his wife were both naked and they felt no shame.

320
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:23,900
 As I said, the Hebrew word here for naked

321
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,900
 is the word alhumim, which literally means to be opened,

322
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,540
 to be laid bare.

323
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,660
 Actually, the concept is less about nakedness

324
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,660
 in a physical way and more about openness and vulnerability.

325
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:46,780
 To alhumim is to be completely exposed,

326
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,580
 to not hide anything, to have no secrets.

327
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,220
 It is the ultimate expression of trust,

328
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:59,140
 to be completely known by the other without any reservations

329
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,660
 and to be known in the same way by them in return.

330
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:09,380
 It is a posture of total availability

331
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,000
 when all that we are is offered outwardly

332
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,380
 in openness and love.

333
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,100
 When we are told that Adam and Eve were alhumim,

334
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,900
 it makes sense that they were also unashamed

335
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,260
 because alhumim by its very definition

336
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,580
 has no room for shame or hiddenness or secrets.

337
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:41,300
 God creates humanity in the posture of alhumim

338
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,580
 and it is a beautiful thing.

339
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,380
 It is his intention for humanity

340
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,100
 that we would be completely open

341
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,660
 and at ease before himself and each other.

342
00:22:54,660 --> 00:23:00,700
 And that my friends is the picture that really summarises

343
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,700
 the close of God's creative process

344
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,460
 in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2.

345
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,720
 So what happens?

346
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,300
 Genesis 3.

347
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,580
 (congregation laughing)

348
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,700
 That's what happens.

349
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,980
 We know the story, don't we?

350
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,020
 Eve was tempted by the devil.

351
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,540
 She yielded to the temptation and went down into sin.

352
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,620
 She yielded to Satan and disobeyed God.

353
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:41,980
 And she lost not only her own state,

354
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,940
 but she pulled Adam down with her.

355
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,740
 Why? Because he loved her.

356
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,020
 His eyes were wide open.

357
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,860
 God blamed him.

358
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,340
 God said it was Eve that was deceived.

359
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,140
 She was more easily tempted,

360
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,140
 but Adam, don't get me wrong,

361
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,380
 went into the thing with his eyes wide open.

362
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,140
 What we can learn from this

363
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,700
 can be discovered in Genesis 3, verse 1.

364
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,420
 Now the serpent was more crafty

365
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,740
 than any of the wild animals that the Lord God had made.

366
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,380
 He said to the woman,

367
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,460
 did God really say?

368
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,980
 Did God really say,

369
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,500
 you must not eat from any tree in the garden?

370
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,660
 What did God say in Genesis 1-2?

371
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,500
 You can have all of those, but don't eat from the tree.

372
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,420
 And I believe there were three sins here.

373
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:54,700
 Firstly, the serpent twisted and contradicted God's Word.

374
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:01,060
 Secondly, Eve subtracted from and added to God's Word.

375
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:06,420
 And thirdly, Adam knew, but he disobeyed God's Word.

376
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,940
 Can you remember our last teaching series?

377
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,420
 It only finished last week.

378
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,460
 It taught us to beware.

379
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,340
 The voice that said,

380
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,260
 did God really say,

381
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,900
 is as real today as it was in the garden.

382
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,540
 Did God really say,

383
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,420
 I shouldn't sleep with my boyfriend before we are married?

384
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:38,260
 Did God really say, I shouldn't be watching pornography?

385
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,620
 Did God really say, I should honour my parents?

386
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,780
 I could go on.

387
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:50,420
 But what I do say is beware.

388
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,900
 Now, how many years Eve lived, we don't know.

389
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,140
 But we do know that after sin ended her,

390
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,180
 she began to lose her beauty.

391
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,260
 Something went out of her.

392
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,180
 There is a beauty of holiness.

393
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,940
 There are some women who have little physical beauty,

394
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,260
 but you see there's a beauty inside of them

395
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,740
 that isn't physical.

396
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,580
 It comes from the inside, a radiance, a state of mind,

397
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,380
 a soul, a serenity that makes them beautiful.

398
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,780
 And it is a beauty that doesn't fade.

399
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,340
 What will it be like when we have a perfect body

400
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,060
 and a perfect soul?

401
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,300
 Perfect inner beauty without sin.

402
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:51,740
 And this is an interesting thing, my friends.

403
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,900
 The naked and unashamedness, the alumin,

404
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,740
 has been replaced by deceit.

405
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,020
 And you know what the Hebrew word for deceit is?

406
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,340
 It is alum.

407
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,820
 Interesting, isn't it?

408
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:22,140
 Alumin has been replaced by alum.

409
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:30,300
 After the sin in the garden came conscience, condemnation.

410
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,540
 Condemnation always tears down.

411
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,980
 Sin always brings distress.

412
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,660
 Sin puts lines in the face.

413
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,740
 Though Eve's beauty lingered for a while,

414
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,580
 yet there was a gradual deterioration.

415
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:53,580
 Death set in, physical, mental, and spiritual death.

416
00:27:53,580 --> 00:28:00,140
 Now, undoubtedly, she and Adam came back to God

417
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,060
 for God sought them out.

418
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,820
 We believe that.

419
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,620
 We hope that.

420
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,500
 But God does not tell us how long they lived.

421
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,740
 Perhaps it was hundreds of years,

422
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,140
 because in those days, if you read the Old Testament,

423
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,780
 they seemed to live longer than we do today.

424
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,820
 But there was a gradual deterioration.

425
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:29,180
 I believe Eve was a woman of faith.

426
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,020
 I believe she was a really saved woman.

427
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,940
 Why?

428
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,060
 Because she was looking forward to the birth of the Messiah.

429
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:49,500
 God had promised that from her would come forth the Messiah.

430
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,700
 He said the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent's head

431
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:03,460
 and though Eve, because she had fallen,

432
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:07,780
 brought forth children into the state of sin

433
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,420
 into which she had fallen.

434
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,780
 And we see this in the battle between Cain and Abel.

435
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:15,900
 And the first murder in the Bible came

436
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,900
 when one brother, Cain, killed the other, Abel.

437
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:27,020
 Beauty had turned to ugliness.

438
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:33,460
 Arumen had turned to Arum.

439
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:39,860
 And yet God promised that through Eve would come the Messiah,

440
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,660
 the son of Mary, and through him,

441
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:48,180
 the redemption that would bring back the human race,

442
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,660
 back to the state that she and Adam first enjoyed.

443
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,380
 Genesis 3:15 says this,

444
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,100
 "I will put enmity between you and the woman

445
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,020
 and between your seed and her seed.

446
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,020
 He shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel."

447
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:09,340
 The Lord Jesus was the seed of the woman.

448
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:15,540
 Through Mary was fulfilled the promise of God to Eve.

449
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:22,900
 The reason I believe that Eve was a godly woman

450
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,260
 is that when God gave her her first son, Cain,

451
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,740
 she said, "I have gotten a man from the Lord."

452
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,260
 She thought that Cain would fulfill the prophecy

453
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,780
 of the coming Messiah.

454
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:42,140
 She must have been deeply grieved when that son, Cain,

455
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,840
 who she thought would bring them back to a perfect state,

456
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,360
 actually murdered her other son.

457
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,100
 Maybe God told her that the Messiah would come later

458
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,620
 and by another woman.

459
00:30:56,620 --> 00:31:03,020
 But through the seed of the woman would be born the Messiah.

460
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,800
 My friends, Jesus came.

461
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:13,340
 He went to the cross at his first coming

462
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,900
 and died for our sins to save our souls.

463
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

464
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:30,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

465
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:36,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

466
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

467
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

468
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

469
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

470
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:02,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

471
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:08,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

472
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:14,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

473
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

474
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:26,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

475
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

476
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:38,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

477
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:44,900
 He died for our sins to save our souls.

478
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,900
 Trust him for your redemption

479
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,900
 and for the restoration of your body as well as your soul.

480
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,900
 He purchased it for you at the cross.

481
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,900
 Put your trust in him today.

482
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:13,900
 Would it just be God to use the story of a fallen woman, Eve,

483
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,900
 to bring you to salvation?

484
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:26,900
 Whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life.

485
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,900
 God bless you.

486
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,900
 Can I ask the band to come up?

487
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:41,900
 Maybe you'd all stand.

488
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:54,900
 I just want to finish by giving you a challenge.

489
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:01,900
 Are you trusting the Lord Jesus Christ today

490
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:07,900
 for your salvation, for your redemption?

491
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:13,900
 Are those of you in the overflow rooms trusting the Lord Jesus?

492
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,900
 Are you on YouTube?

493
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
 It's not the time to go out now and make a cup of tea.

494
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
 I just want to tell you.

495
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:30,900
 I'm going to invite you today to put your faith in Jesus.

496
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,900
 So one day you'll be able to tell your friends, your kids, your grandkids.

497
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:44,900
 That day when that silly pastor in the red trousers was talking about a woman,

498
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,900
 when he was talking about Eve,

499
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:53,900
 that was the day I decided to put my trust in Jesus Christ.

500
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,900
 That was the day I knew I was saved.

501
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:00,900
 That was the day I knew I was free from my sins.

502
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,900
 That was the day that I realized that one day I'm going to be with Him

503
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,900
 and I'm going to be totally restored.

504
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,900
 Let's close our eyes as I pray.

505
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:25,900
 Lord Jesus, I come to you now.

506
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,900
 I realize for so long I've trusted in my own righteousness.

507
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,900
 I know I've done things

508
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:44,900
 that have offended you and have caused offense to others.

509
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:49,900
 Your word caused those things, sin.

510
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,900
 I choose now today

511
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,900
 to give you my sin

512
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,900
 because you took that upon the cross.

513
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,900
 And I ask you to give me a new life

514
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,900
 and a new hope

515
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,900
 and a new future.

516
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,900
 Lord Jesus, I repent of my past

517
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,900
 and I offer you my future.

518
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,900
 Come into my life and fill me with your Spirit.

519
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,900
 I pray in Jesus' name.

520
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:33,900
 Amen.

521
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,900
 And if you prayed that prayer, please tell someone.

522
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,900
 If you're in this room or in the overflow room,

523
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,900
 come to the well afterwards and share with us.

524
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,900
 Just say, "I just prayed that prayer."

525
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,900
 And someone will pray with you and encourage you.

526
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,900
 If you're on YouTube and you're there with someone, tell them.

527
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,900
 If not, drop us a line and say, "I prayed that prayer today."

528
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:05,900
 We'd love to encourage you more in your Christian journey.

529
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,900
 Church, we've got eight more weeks of women to go.

530
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,900
 It was a great start with Eve.

531
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,900
 But we're going to sing that song again.

532
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,900
 I'm no longer a slave to fear.

533
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,900
 I am a child of God.
