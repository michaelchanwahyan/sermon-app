1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
(廣東話)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
我們今天開始繼續我們的Romans的系列

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
考考你們

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,500
上個禮拜Pastor Gavin說了些甚麼?

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Pastor Gavin說了些甚麼?

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
記不記得?

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
不記得?

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,000
Gester...甚麼?Esther?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,500
OK,Esther的朋友,記得

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
還有呢?

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,500
還有,記得些甚麼?

12
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,000
沒人記得?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
Don't judge,OK?

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
Gavin說Don't judge,好啊

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,000
上個禮拜是說

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
這基督徒,這個教會是有選擇的

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
是嗎?有甚麼choice?有甚麼選擇?

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
選擇甚麼?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,500
不記得?甚麼選擇?

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Cindy記不記得?甚麼選擇?

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
弟弟,記不記得?

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,500
選擇去forgive,OK?

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Aaron呢?

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Same answer,OK,thank you

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
有選擇,記不記得?

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,500
這個教會很多人就想吃肉

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,500
有些人就覺得吃肉不好,是嗎?

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,500
上個禮拜,Pastor Gavin,這四個point

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
第一,both are accepted by God

30
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,500
both do it for God, both belong to God

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
both need to give an account to God

32
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,500
為甚麼有些人在教會想吃肉

33
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
有些人又不想吃肉,為甚麼?

34
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
是否這些肉不夠high grade?

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,500
不是Angus beef,不是Kobe beef

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,500
不是這個Wagyu beef,所以不想吃,是嗎?

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,500
是嗎?為甚麼不想吃這些牛肉,或是甚麼肉?

38
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
為甚麼不想吃?知不知道?有沒有人知道?

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Winnie那組呢?有沒有人知道?

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
不知道

41
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
因為以前猶太人吃不吃肉?

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
吃甚麼肉?

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,500
不吃豬肉,是嗎?

44
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
他們很particular,跟甚麼?

45
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
follow甚麼?

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,500
follow舊約,是嗎?

47
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
舊約有很多不同的rules

48
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,500
所以他們有時覺得吃肉就不用了

49
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
他們跟回他們猶太的background

50
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,500
有些人在這個教會都不想吃肉

51
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,500
知不知道為甚麼?

52
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,500
因為他以前是甚麼dominant culture?

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
甚麼是dominant culture?

54
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
以前是甚麼dominant culture?

55
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
他們的猶太人

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,500
What was the dominant culture of that time?

57
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,500
現在好像,現在是甚麼culture最dominant?

58
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:04,500
你的movie,你的style,多數在哪裡來的?

59
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
不知道?

60
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,500
It's American, mostly, right?

61
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,500
It's getting more versatile around the world

62
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,500
但他們以前是甚麼dominant culture?

63
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Roman culture

64
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,500
那些Romans多數的肉是怎樣的?

65
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,500
肉之前是怎樣的?

66
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
是獻給誰的?

67
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
獻給主耶穌,是嗎?

68
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
是Roman gods

69
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,500
所以有很多基督徒都不太想吃肉

70
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
因為很多這些肉

71
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,500
不知道是否被Romans獻給了不同的神

72
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
So those are the different reasons

73
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
因為有個battle between the Jews

74
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,500
and the new Christians

75
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,500
that were of different origins

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,500
我們這次就讀15章

77
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,500
我們請Ava讀

78
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Thank you

79
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,500
我們堅強的人

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,500
應該分擔不堅強的人的軟弱

81
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
不求自己的喜悅

82
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
我們各人務必要讓鄰人喜悅

83
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,500
使他得益處得助紂

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,500
因為基督也不求自己的喜悅

85
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
如經上所記

86
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,500
肉麻利的人的肉麻都落在我身上

87
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
OK, thank you

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
這裡說甚麼?

89
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
We who are strong

90
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
have an obligation

91
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,500
to bear with the failings of the weak

92
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Who are the strong?

93
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,500
誰覺得自己很強?

94
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
舉手

95
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
誰覺得自己很強?

96
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
很強的?

97
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
舉手

98
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
沒有人覺得自己很強?

99
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
OK,那嬰兒是嗎?

100
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
嬰兒舉手

101
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
對呀,嬰兒

102
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
兩個手

103
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
這個嬰兒很強的

104
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
誰覺得自己很弱?

105
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
舉手

106
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,500
誰不知道自己是強還是弱?

107
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
沒有人知道

108
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
OK, thank you

109
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,500
在Romans 15

110
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
和之前的Romans 14

111
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Who are the strong?

112
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,500
誰是強的人?

113
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
誰是很強的?

114
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
很大隻?

115
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
誰是?

116
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Who are the strong?

117
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
之前呢

118
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
就是

119
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
有些人吃肉呢

120
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
可能受到

121
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
肚子是強的

122
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
是不是?

123
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
那就可以

124
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
那食物是強的

125
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
OK

126
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
那可能他們是

127
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
Physically stronger

128
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
保羅呢

129
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
都是說

130
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
誰是強的?

131
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Strong in faith

132
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
有信心的

133
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Strong in faith

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
還有呢

135
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
保羅都是可能說

136
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,500
那些領袖

137
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,500
教會那些領袖

138
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,500
不同的牧師呀

139
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Deacon呀

140
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Those who are strong

141
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
那我們今天呢

142
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
就會說三樣東西

143
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
基督徒我們要做的

144
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Duty as a Christian

145
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
第一呢

146
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Bear with those who are weak

147
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Bear with those who are weak

148
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
第二呢

149
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Please not ourselves

150
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Please not ourselves

151
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
And the last one is

152
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Live in harmony

153
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
And welcome one another

154
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
好

155
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
第一

156
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
保羅叫我們呢

157
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
就是

158
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
Bear with the weak

159
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Bear with the weak

160
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
誰覺得他是弱的?

161
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
誰是弱的?

162
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Who are the weak?

163
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Timothy is weak

164
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
OK

165
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
為什麼Timothy是弱的?

166
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
你覺得

167
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,500
(No, I always said that you have to drink water)

168
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
OK

169
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Yeah

170
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
之前呢

171
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
他們是

172
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
喝水的時候呢

173
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
誰在家裡有filter的?

174
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
誰在家裡有filter?

175
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
只是

176
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Peer有filter?

177
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
你們家裡沒有filter的?

178
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Winnie OK

179
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
之前你覺得他們

180
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
怎麼拿水喝的?

181
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
你覺得

182
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Timon

183
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Timon這個組

184
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
很多東西說的組

185
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
你講一下

186
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
之前你覺得他們

187
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
怎麼

188
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
在哪裡拿水喝的?

189
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
在耶穌那個時間

190
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
River OK

191
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Bank OK

192
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
知道Roman aqueducts

193
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
他們帶水

194
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
在River那裡

195
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
然後流進城市

196
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
OK

197
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
那時候有沒有filter的?

198
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
用什麼filter的?

199
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
有沒有filter?

200
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
沒有

201
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
自己

202
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
用口去喝

203
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
然後再去喝

204
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
是不是

205
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
這樣filter

206
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
沒有filter

207
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
有沒有boil water?

208
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Maybe they boiled water

209
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Rain OK

210
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Rain water就是peer

211
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
是不是

212
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
之前可能他的水

213
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
沒有那麼乾淨

214
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
所以保羅就叫Timothy

215
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
add少少alcohol

216
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
那就不會生病了

217
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
因為他經常喝那些水

218
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
可能會導致他有一點sickness

219
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Who are the weak?

220
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,500
我們之前說

221
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
很有信心的

222
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
就是strong

223
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
有些在教會

224
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
沒有那麼多信心

225
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
了解聖經沒有那麼多

226
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
信仰沒有那麼多

227
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
這個就是spiritually weak

228
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
有些人是physically weaker

229
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
是不是

230
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
可能不能digest那些肉

231
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
他們的stomach

232
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
吃菜好一點

233
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
或者有些是mentally weak

234
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
是不是

235
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
我們現在的society

236
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
很去focus

237
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
有不同的mental illness

238
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
是不是

239
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
有不同的mental depression

240
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
那些不同的東西

241
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
所以我們看到

242
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
我們現在的教會

243
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,500
都有不同的strong和weak

244
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Some people are physically strong

245
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Some people are physically weak

246
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
是不是

247
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
有些人可能有些病

248
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
going through some physical injury

249
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
是不是

250
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
有些人可能mentally strong

251
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
是不是

252
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
好passion去做事

253
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
讀書

254
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
但是有些人可能是mentally weak

255
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
是不是

256
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
有些人可能很懶

257
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
或者going through some depression

258
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
or something like that

259
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
我們教會

260
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,500
可能有些人的信心很強

261
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
All right

262
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Faithfully

263
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Spiritually strong

264
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
In faith

265
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
但是有些人可能

266
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
屬靈上是很弱的

267
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,500
是不是

268
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
可能有時讀一下聖經

269
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
有時不讀

270
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
是不是

271
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
有時回教會

272
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,500
有時不回

273
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,500
有時人是spiritually weaker

274
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
那保羅就叫我們

275
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
強的那些人

276
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
those who are strong

277
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
we need to bear with the weak

278
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
bear with the weak

279
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
那

280
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,500
我們怎樣可以去bear with the weak

281
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
就

282
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
有些人是

283
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
可能spiritually

284
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
emotionally

285
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
mentally weaker

286
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
第一我有三點

287
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
第一

288
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
我們要realize

289
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
we are all weak and need Christ

290
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
第一個point

291
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
我們怎樣可以bear with the weak

292
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
我們是要謙卑

293
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
謙卑

294
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,500
我們要realize

295
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
我們每個人都有弱點

296
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
我們每個人都要處理耶穌

297
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,500
誰覺得他們自己都很謙卑

298
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
誰覺得自己謙卑

299
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Jasmine 是不是

300
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
不是

301
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
是頭髮而已

302
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
誰覺得自己是謙卑

303
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
沒有人覺得自己是謙卑

304
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
OK

305
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
第一

306
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
怎樣我們可以bear with the weak

307
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
我們是要自己謙卑自己

308
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
你覺得你很厲害很威呢

309
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,500
不用了

310
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
不用care這些人了

311
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
是不是

312
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
多厲害

313
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
好像天安那樣考完試

314
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
七月才來

315
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
多厲害

316
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
不用理那些weak的人了

317
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
是不是

318
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
會不會好像這樣

319
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
是不是

320
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
我們要realize

321
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,500
我們每個人都有弱點

322
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
我們要謙卑我們自己

323
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
第二

324
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,500
你謙卑了

325
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
就要看到人

326
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
看到

327
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
你看看你旁邊那些人

328
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
是不是

329
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
recognize

330
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
有些人是要我們幫的

331
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
是不是

332
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,500
你要看到你旁邊那邊

333
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,500
旁邊那些人有沒有人有需要幫他

334
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,500
有沒有看過

335
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
還是自己看自己

336
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
我要什麼

337
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
我穿什麼

338
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
我多帥

339
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
只是看自己

340
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
誰只是看自己

341
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
有沒有人

342
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,500
沒有

343
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,500
OK

344
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Very good

345
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
第三

346
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
你謙卑了自己

347
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
你看到

348
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
那些人的需要

349
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
第三是什麼

350
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
是要reach out

351
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
reach out

352
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
是不是

353
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
你reach out你旁邊那邊

354
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
reach out

355
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
會不會reach out

356
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
OK

357
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
只有幾個會reach out

358
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
好像遠足一樣

359
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
有沒有人去過遠足

360
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
recently

361
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
有沒有人去過遠足

362
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
沒有

363
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
太多魚嗎

364
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
OK

365
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
這年有沒有去過遠足

366
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
舉手

367
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
沒有去過遠足

368
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
你們只是坐在家裡玩遊戲機

369
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
OK

370
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
不遠足

371
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
OK

372
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,500
你遠足

373
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
有沒有人陪過人遠足

374
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,500
陪朋友遠足

375
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Ethan I know you hiked

376
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
Why don't you raise your hand

377
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,500
OK

378
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
誰和朋友遠足

379
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
舉手

380
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
OK

381
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
好

382
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
你們群組朋友

383
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
你遠足的時候

384
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
有沒有人平時走快一點

385
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
有人走慢一點

386
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
是不是Timon很慢

387
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
不是

388
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,500
他不走

389
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,500
即是怎樣

390
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
OK

391
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Stamina差了一點

392
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
誰覺得自己的stamina差一點

393
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500

399
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
有些人走得很快

400
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
誰走

401
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500

402
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500

403
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500

408
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500

410
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
但如果你是一個群組

411
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
有些人走快

412
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
有些人走慢

413
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
那要怎樣

414
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
如果想stay together

415
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500

416
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500

422
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
這些人這麼快都覺得煩

423
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
為什麼這麼快不等

424
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500

to build him up

597
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500

耶穌那時候

626
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,500
門徒都問他

627
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
who is my neighbor

628
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
my neighbor

629
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
那我們讀Luke 10

630
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
我們請Ava幫我們讀Luke 10

631
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Luke 10

632
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
他回答說

633
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
你要盡心

634
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500

盡義愛主你的神

637
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
又要愛倫如己

638
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
耶穌對他說

639
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
你回答得正確

640
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
你這樣做就會得永生

641
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
哪人要證明

642
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
自己有你

643
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
就對耶穌說

644
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
誰是我的倫犀呢

645
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
對了

646
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
門徒問他

647
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
who is my neighbor

648
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
耶穌說

649
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
love your enemies

650
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
or love God, love others

651
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500

652
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
他就說

653
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
who is my neighbor

654
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
然後耶穌就說了什麼故事

655
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
講什麼故事

656
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
對了

657
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
The Good Samaritan

658
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
這個人

659
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
被人打

660
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
搶了東西

661
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
衣服都偷了

662
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
然後什麼人走過

663
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
這個人

664
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
是什麼人

665
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500

670
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
閃

671
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
然後Levi又來

672
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
是不是

673
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500

是不是

679
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
最後這個人

680
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
就是一個Samaritan

681
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500

684
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
猶太人覺得

是不是

703
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
他幫他

704
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
那麼這個故事

705
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
耶穌說了之後

706
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500

distinguish what is good

725
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
How do we distinguish

726
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
what is good for our neighbor

727
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
我們怎樣去

728
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
distinguish

729
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
知不知道

730
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Timon知不知道

731
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
不知道

732
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
How do we distinguish what is good

733
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Gabe

734
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
How do we distinguish

735
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
How to please our neighbor for his good

736
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
第一

737
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,500
How do we distinguish

738
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
what is good in general

739
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,500
Read the Bible

740
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,500
這個Sunday school answer

741
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Very good 讀聖經

742
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
讀聖經

743
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
然後要看

744
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
神說什麼是好

745
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
和不好

746
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
That's the first point

747
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,500
然後第二

748
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
是用我們

749
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
自己的reason

750
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,500
吃這些東西好

751
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
吃這些東西不好

752
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
讀書

753
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Do some study

754
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
看看什麼是好不好

755
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
The first thing is

756
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Is it biblical

757
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
然後第二

758
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
他就說

759
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
不單是for his good

760
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
是要build him up

761
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Build him up

762
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500

791
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500

00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
給什麼

795
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
我們怎麼去決定

796
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
what is good

797
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
我們怎麼決定

798
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
我們就想

799
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,500
什麼是biblical

800
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
給飯biblical

801
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
給錢biblical

802
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
用reason

803
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
為什麼

804
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
他們會用這些錢去做什麼

805
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
如果他們用錢去買不好的東西

806
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
那就不好

807
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,500
我們的reason是

808
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
我們派飯給他們

809
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
他們吃了就好了

810
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
那個reasoning

811
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
this is how we help our neighbor

812
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
是要用wisdom去help

813
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
不是傻傻的去help

814
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
要用wisdom

815
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
去help

816
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,500
ok

817
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
alright let's go to

818
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,500
point number

819
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
three

820
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
我們讀第四

821
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
和第七節

822
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
我們請

823
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
Ava幫我們讀

824
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
從前所寫的聖經

825
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
都是為教導我們寫的

826
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
要使我們直著忍耐

827
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
和因聖經所生的安慰

828
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
得著盼望

829
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
但願此一生

830
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
忍耐和安慰的神

831
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
使你們彼此同心

832
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
效法基督耶穌

833
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
為使你們

834
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
同心同聲

835
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
榮耀我們主耶穌

836
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
基督的父神

837
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
所以你們要彼此接納

838
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
如同基督接納你們一樣

839
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
歸榮耀給神

840
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
ok

841
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
very good

842
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
第一個point

843
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
我們要bear with the weak

844
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
bear with the weak

845
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
point number two

846
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
what was point number two

847
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
to please our neighbor

848
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
for his good

849
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
and to build him up

850
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
just like Jesus does for us

851
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,500
第三個point

852
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
live in harmony

853
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
and welcome one another

854
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,500
第五節

855
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
他就這樣說

856
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
one voice to glorify God

857
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ

858
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ

859
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,500
therefore welcome one another

860
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,500
as Christ has welcomed you

861
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
為什麼我們要

862
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
live in harmony

863
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,500
and welcome one another

864
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
為什麼

865
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,500
因為耶穌先歡迎我們

866
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
耶穌先歡迎我們

867
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,500
去祂的家庭

868
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
第二

869
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,500
it glorifies God

870
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,500
it glorifies God

871
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
主耶穌

872
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
幫我們set an example

873
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,500
of welcoming

874
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,500
each other

875
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
and bringing peace

876
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
with one another

877
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,500
之前

878
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,500
保羅說

879
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,500
猶太人和non-Jews

880
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,500
他們沒有peace

881
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
沒有平安

882
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
是耶穌先帶真正的平安

883
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
為什麼耶穌

884
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
先帶真正的平安呢

885
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
我們可不可以

886
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
看那個圖表

887
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
兩個圓形的

888
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
兩個圓形的

889
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
第一

890
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
猶太人

891
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
他們明白

892
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,500
舊約

893
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
他們認識神

894
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
真正的神

895
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
他們就跟隨神的法律

896
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
他們有食物限制

897
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
所以

898
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
non-Jews

899
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,500
他們信奉什麼

900
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,500
不同的東西

901
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
羅馬神

902
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,500
所以有不同的

903
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:25,500
分別

904
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
猶太人

905
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
是受神的祝福

906
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
他們是神的選擇

907
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
還有他們認識神

908
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
但是non-Jews

909
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,500
他們跟隨自己的法律

910
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
他敬拜

911
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
他自己的不同的偶像

912
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
但是主耶穌

913
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
帶給我們

914
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,500
真正的平安

915
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,500
好像

916
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,500
two olive trees

917
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
有一個是cultivated

918
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,500
olive tree

919
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
cultivated olive tree

920
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
好像猶太人

921
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,500
Jews are the cultivated tree

922
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
那個wild

923
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
小的那個

924
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
是wild olive tree

925
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
wild olive tree

926
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
你們有沒有見過

927
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
兩個

928
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
兩個

929
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,500
hold on a second

930
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,500
have you seen an apple and an orange tree together

931
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
有沒有人見過

932
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
一棵樹是有蘋果和橙

933
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,500
有沒有可能

934
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
有沒有可能

935
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
有沒有可能

936
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
Cindy有沒有可能

937
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
見過

938
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
沒有

939
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,500
他們是在做一個

940
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
一個樹

941
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
被一棵樹

942
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
合成

943
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,500
叫做合成

944
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,500
合成是一個技巧

945
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,500
在樹的樹枝

946
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
合成

947
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
讓它們一起長大

948
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
ok

949
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
那麼

950
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,500
聖經的合成

951
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
基督徒被

952
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
合成

953
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
我們看下一個slide

954
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
ok

955
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
for example

956
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,500
你有這棵樹

957
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
你就cut了這個branch

958
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
然後你

959
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
不同的tree

960
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,500
好像stitch回去

961
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
這個就是grafting

962
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
grafting

963
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
那麼就可以

964
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
蘋果樹

965
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
有蘋果和生橙都可以

966
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,500
很奇妙的

967
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
很奇妙

968
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
it's called grafting

969
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,500
go next slide

970
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
ok

971
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,500
這個original

972
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
是猶太人

973
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
or the cultivated

974
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,500
olive tree

975
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
猶太人之前就認識神先

976
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,500
是不是

977
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
之前不是猶太人

978
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
的人就不認識神

979
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,500
那麼主耶穌怎麼可以帶這棵樹

980
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
去到這棵樹

981
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
這棵樹

982
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
to become one church

983
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
ok

984
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
那麼這個process叫grafting

985
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,500
ok

986
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
grafting

987
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
之前是兩棵樹

988
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
現在

989
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,500
是one church

990
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
one church

991
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,500
ok

992
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,500
the believers

993
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
樹葉是

994
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,500
信了的人

995
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,500
決志了

996
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
信了耶穌的人

997
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
以色列是olive tree

998
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
ok

999
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
然後

1000
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
the messiah is the root

1001
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
messiah is the root

1002
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
God

1003
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
first commanded

1004
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
the Jews

1005
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
to share the blessings

1006
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
to the world

1007
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,500
ok 但是他們fail了

1008
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
那麼誰要來

1009
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
耶穌就要來了

1010
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
耶穌就graft了我們的

1011
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
wild olive tree into

1012
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
the big tree

1013
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:13,500
那麼我們看到耶穌的example

1014
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,500
her bring peace

1015
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
to one another

1016
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
那麼我們就問個問題

1017
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
next slide

1018
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
how do we live in harmony

1019
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500

1020
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
我們在explorer 在這個教會

每個人都有不同的

1026
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,500

1027
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,500
我們怎樣去live in harmony

1028
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,500
with one another

1029
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,500
how do we do it

1030
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,500
we need to be imitators

1031
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,500
of God

1032
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
be imitators of God

1033
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
如果我們每個人

1034
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
親近神

1035
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,500
每個人

1036
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,500
追求神

1037
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
我們每個人會

1038
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
慢慢become more like

1039
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Jesus Christ

1040
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
因為耶穌

1041
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
幫我們set最好的example

1042
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
是不是

1043
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,500
Jesus was compassionate to those who were weak

1044
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
是不是

1045
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
耶穌為什麼來這個世界

1046
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
是不是

1047
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,500
他是不是feed他自己

1048
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
他feed 5000

1049
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
他feed他自己

1050
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
他create a great buffet

1051
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,500
給自己

1052
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
不是喔

1053
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,500
他來去侍奉

1054
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
去serve others

1055
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
耶穌是不是來heal自己

1056
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
是不是

1057
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,500
是不是來heal自己

1058
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
不是喔

1059
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
heal the weak

1060
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
he came to seek and to save

1061
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
Jesus did not come to please himself

1062
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
he was compassionate

1063
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,500
and he created peace

1064
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,500
between Jews

1065
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,500
and Gentiles

1066
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,500
so we are now one church

1067
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
耶穌是我們

1068
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
最好的榜樣

1069
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
我們做基督徒

1070
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
都要一樣

1071
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
好像耶穌這樣

1072
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,500
去bear with the weak

1073
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
我們身邊人

1074
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
個個都有不同的需要

1075
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,500
我們個個都有不同的strengths and weaknesses

1076
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
我們要學

1077
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
怎樣謙卑自己

1078
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500

1079
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500

00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
不只是please我們自己

1085
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
我們個個都有不同的弱點

1086
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
我們個個都會有selfish

1087
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
be selfish

1088
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
是不是,但我們要學

1089
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
好像主耶穌這樣

1090
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,500
不是please他自己

1091
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
