[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.580]   - Jesus, you are the one that we live for.
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.260]   This month, we remember the day that you invaded earth,
[00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.720]   and then you ended up defeating death.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.980]   And we're also looking forward
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.180]   to the day that you come again.
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.360]   But so during this month,
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.740]   we pray that as we enjoy the Christmas festivities,
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.260]   the gifts that come, Lord, that our eyes
[00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.980]   will never be taken away from you.
[00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.020]   And Lord, that we will use this season
[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.740]   to really draw closer to who you are,
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.160]   to have a better understanding of you.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.020]   Lord, this book, this Bible tells us so much about you,
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.900]   but we pray that it will stay in our heads
[00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.120]   and drop into our hearts, Lord,
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.820]   as we explore why this season,
[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.500]   what is the reason for this season,
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.220]   and why are you the reason?
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.460]   So we pray that your spirit will be with us,
[00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.780]   even in the Zoom arena, Lord,
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.100]   may you speak into our hearts here.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.500]   In Jesus, in your name we pray, amen.
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.140]   So the book of Isaiah is where we're jumping to.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.060]   Isaiah chapter nine, if you'd like to turn to it,
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.620]   but we're actually gonna, this is in some ways,
[00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.460]   I guess you could say topical,
[00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.500]   in that we're only gonna be focusing on one name today,
[00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.940]   which is wonderful counselor.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.780]   And so that's from Isaiah chapter nine, verse six.
[00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.800]   And I wanted to read it to you first,
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.580]   and then I wanted to kind of really go still further
[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.880]   into the one that we're looking at today.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.920]   So Isaiah chapter nine, verse six says this,
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.260]   for to us a child is born, to us a son is given,
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.880]   and the government shall be upon his shoulder,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.280]   and his name shall be called wonderful counselor,
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.280]   mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace.
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.480]   And we've heard those terms before,
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.800]   and over these next few weeks,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   we're actually gonna be going through
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.160]   these four names of Jesus,
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.400]   mighty, wonderful counselor, mighty God,
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.320]   everlasting father, and prince of peace.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.920]   And so I wanted to give us a bit of context,
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.680]   'cause we've heard this verse before,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.800]   there are songs written about this verse,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.160]   we know those names, but just to see where it comes from,
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.240]   I wanna rewind a little bit to Isaiah chapter seven.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.240]   Isaiah chapter seven is where we hear
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.680]   about the name Emmanuel, chapter seven, verse 14.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.960]   So the Lord is speaking to the King of Judah
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.880]   at that moment, Ahaz, and he says this,
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.080]   therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.080]   Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.700]   and shall call his name Emmanuel.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.140]   We later see in scripture, what does Emmanuel mean?
[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.960]   Emmanuel means God with us.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.320]   So what he's saying here is that soon,
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.560]   I'll send you a sign, and the person that will come
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.800]   will come from a virgin,
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.480]   and his name will be called Emmanuel.
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.840]   And Isaiah chapter eight,
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.520]   so we're gearing up to chapter nine,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.680]   chapter eight, the Lord is talking to him
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.240]   about an invasion that's coming.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.440]   The Assyrians are coming, a very, very powerful nation,
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.640]   and there is gonna be a gloom that comes over Judah.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.840]   And they will, in eight, verse 22,
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.360]   and they will be driven, they will be driven into darkness,
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.360]   and they will be thrust into thick darkness.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.320]   So imagine this group of people that hear this from God,
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.200]   that I'm gonna give you someone,
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.520]   it's gonna be someone that's gonna be born of a virgin,
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.560]   that sounds ludicrous to start with,
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.720]   and he's gonna be called Emmanuel,
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.800]   which means God with us, so God's gonna be with you,
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.680]   but you will also be driven into darkness,
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.520]   that there's a group of people
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.660]   that's gonna come and invade you, and you will be suppressed.
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.600]   Can you imagine living in that kind of,
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.920]   with that kind of forecast?
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.760]   And then Isaiah nine happens,
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.240]   and Isaiah nine says this, you will be in darkness,
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.600]   and that's where verse two, what the video was showing,
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.120]   the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light,
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.800]   saying, you will be in darkness,
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.880]   but you will soon see a great light.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   Those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness,
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.640]   on them a light has shone.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.120]   And then you fast forward,
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.400]   and it talks about what this light is,
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.920]   nine, chapter six, chapter nine, verse six, sorry,
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.240]   for to us a child is born, to us a son is given,
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.240]   and the government shall be upon his shoulder,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor,
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.040]   Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.400]   And you see, the prophet Isaiah lived about 700 to 800 years
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.880]   before Jesus actually came.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.280]   So he was a prophesying, he was giving this vision
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.100]   that this Jesus was coming,
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.660]   but Jesus doesn't come yet for a while longer,
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.080]   so actually the people hearing this
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.880]   didn't get to see Jesus, but we do.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.160]   And so for us, as we're looking at this passage,
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.480]   and we're thinking about what does it mean to us
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.720]   that Jesus is the Wonderful Counselor,
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.240]   I invite you to really think,
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.160]   to actually remove our modern day
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.360]   contemporary interpretations of Wonderful and Counselor,
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.440]   and look at it, what does it really mean
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.720]   when scripture is talking about,
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.920]   when the prophet Isaiah is talking about it,
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.240]   and I wanna tackle it word by word.
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.500]   The first word, of course, is wonderful.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.440]   We say this word all the time, right?
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.940]   Do you use the word wonderful?
[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.480]   Let's have a look.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.400]   Some people do.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.080]   Can I get a little hands up if you use the,
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.640]   if you find yourself, are you someone
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.640]   who uses the word wonderful?
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.240]   Put your hand up, oh yes.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.880]   Okay, some people, some people don't.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.280]   I find it's probably the more posh people
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.320]   who like to use the word wonderful.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.040]   I use the word wonderful.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.960]   I like it, but there's nothing wonderful
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.320]   in 2020 though, of course.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.880]   But have you ever thought about
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.000]   how you use the word wonderful?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.440]   Oh, you know, that was a, you know what?
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.880]   That was a wonderful meal.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.320]   Oh, the light decorations are really wonderful.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.960]   He is just a wonderful person.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.700]   What a wonderful preacher.
[00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.640]   And so we use it in that kind of term, right?
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.840]   And what it means is just,
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.720]   the way we use it is kind of like,
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.540]   oh, that's just a very nice thing.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.560]   But is Jesus just a very nice thing?
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.400]   He's not, actually.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.000]   The Hebrew word is palah,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.320]   which actually has a much stronger one.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.500]   I think I just saw Anthony talk about this.
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.960]   It is to be filled with wonder.
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.360]   It is, what it actually means is a phenomenon
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.760]   lying outside of the realm of human explanation.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.560]   So just stop thinking about the word wonderful
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.940]   and just think about the word wonder.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.960]   That makes more sense.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.500]   Actually, that's more accurate to its original meaning.
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.520]   Wonder is, wow.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.680]   So what he's saying here is that Jesus is a wonder
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.520]   of a counselor.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.600]   It is supernatural.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:41.600]   It is beyond, it is beyond the realm of human explanation.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.840]   And I wonder whether we actually see Jesus like that
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.400]   or whether we see Jesus in the more contemporary way
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.840]   of saying, he's a wonderful guy.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.080]   He was just a standup chap.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.580]   He was just a good guy.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.480]   No, Jesus is the wonderful counselor.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.680]   He was full of wonder.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.760]   He was a wonder of a counselor.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.920]   And today I wanted to share with you some thoughts about it.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.040]   And you guys know I always have three points,
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.260]   but I didn't go with slides this time
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.960]   because I've been doing homeschooling.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.400]   Well, Christina does most of the homeschooling with Ruben,
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.640]   but we've been using a whiteboard
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.480]   and I thought it would be nice
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.800]   to actually have it on the whiteboard.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.680]   But of course my handwriting isn't the best.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.640]   So it is definitely not a wonderful handwriting.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.800]   Wow, wonderful.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.400]   What a great word, five-line email.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.040]   So wonderful counselor.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.600]   And there's three things I wanna share with you
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.480]   about wonderful counselor.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.600]   I don't know if you can read my writing.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.760]   The first one is, can anyone read that?
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.120]   Type it if you can read it.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.000]   Let me see if anyone can read it.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.280]   Handwriting is good.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.000]   Oh, thank you, Agnes.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.920]   Thank you, incomprehensible.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.840]   The first word I wanted to share
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.400]   is that Jesus as wonderful counselor is incomprehensible.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.560]   Second word is incredible.
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.200]   And the third word is inspiring.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.680]   So I wanted to go through all of these
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.920]   to help us really get an idea of understanding
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.960]   what it really means that Jesus is the wonderful counselor.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.880]   So the first word, incomprehensible.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.680]   Jesus is hard to understand.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:14.080]   Jesus is, the concept of God is hard to understand.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.640]   It's a mystery to us.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.960]   Psalm 139 talks about this,
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.320]   that there's such knowledge that is too wonderful for me.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.920]   It is high, I cannot attain it.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.000]   It's something that's beyond explanation.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.160]   It's something that you can't actually explain.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.760]   It's not of this world.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.480]   So Jesus isn't of this world,
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:36.440]   but have you ever tried to use worldly terms
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.720]   to describe Jesus?
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.880]   I mean, that's the only tool that we have, right?
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.320]   And so then you see the apostle John
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.520]   seeing very worldly things, sorry, supernatural things,
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.040]   and he's forced to write them down
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.040]   and you read Revelation and you're like,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.400]   we're natural beings trying to understand
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.520]   a supernatural God,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.240]   recognizing that his thoughts and his ways
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.840]   are so much higher than ours.
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.360]   But so often we try and box them into
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.560]   what we try and understand.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.080]   And that's where the problem comes.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.160]   And we get discouraged or disappointed,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.200]   or we even don't believe when we don't understand this God.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.480]   I'm seeing a chat.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.600]   Oh, so, you know, there's this idea of,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.800]   we often try to understand God,
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.240]   but it's really just the same as like Harry Potter
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.240]   trying to understand J.K. Rowling.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.080]   J.K. Rowling is the author of the Harry Potter series.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.240]   Harry Potter is never gonna understand J.K. Rowling
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.160]   because they exist in a different realm, right?
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.800]   The star of this book, of this story, Harry,
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.320]   is never gonna understand the author.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.120]   They exist in very different realms.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.160]   So just the same as us and God,
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.680]   we exist in very different realms.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.200]   When I try to talk to Walter, my dog,
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.000]   he doesn't understand the concepts
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.080]   that I'm trying to describe to him.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.360]   Forget Walter, my daughter, who's three years old,
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.520]   struggles to understand some of the concepts
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.920]   that I'm giving her.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.520]   For example, even for her,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.640]   for a young human being like Alicia,
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.600]   who's three years old,
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.240]   she doesn't understand the concept of time.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.000]   Well, at least she thinks she does, but she doesn't.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.680]   One day we were catching the minibus
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.640]   and I was trying to keep her quiet and shut her up,
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.040]   so I gave her a candy and I said,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.280]   "You're allowed to have this sweet in five minutes."
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.000]   Now I said it, 'cause that buys me time,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.520]   and I said it in Cantonese,
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.400]   And so she was like, "Okay."
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.360]   And then what did she do?
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.200]   She said, (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.040]   "Okay."
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.640]   And so she didn't even understand the concept
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.400]   of waiting five minutes.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.120]   Of course, she's a young girl, but do you get it?
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.080]   So if we as humans struggle to portray
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.160]   and present concepts to each other,
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.400]   how can we even understand the things of God?
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.320]   The things of God are so much higher.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.520]   And I lead Bible studies and I meet different people,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.040]   very smart people, and atheists,
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.600]   and they ask me these questions about God,
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.160]   and sometimes I can answer them and sometimes I can't.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.040]   But do you understand that we're natural beings
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.240]   trying to describe a supernatural God.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.120]   He is incomprehensible.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.240]   Christ, though, is the wisdom and power of God.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.920]   He is the mystery of God revealed.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.440]   See, it is a mystery to us.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.920]   For now, we only know in part,
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.200]   but soon we will know in full.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.080]   You see, the job for us isn't
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.520]   to make sense of God right now, because we're not God.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.400]   Actually, I would be very worried
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.840]   if you say you believe in a God
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.400]   that you completely understand, right?
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.480]   'Cause therefore, is it really God or are you God?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.920]   So there's this idea that we have to try
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.880]   and understand everything.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.000]   And actually we have this very noble and righteous pursuit,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.480]   which is called theology.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.920]   But the aim of theology is not to be able to find out
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.440]   all that we can about God,
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.200]   but rather to live out all we can with what we know.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.600]   See, when we accumulate knowledge,
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.880]   it's not about trying to find out everything we can,
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.680]   but it is to live out all we can with what we know.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.800]   So when we're thinking about God and Jesus
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.400]   as the wonderful counselor,
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.000]   we have to recognize when he says wonderful,
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.400]   he is a wonder of a counselor.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.960]   He is a supernatural thing.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:21.680]   We can't comprehend Jesus fully,
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.560]   but we don't have to,
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.360]   because you don't need to understand
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.680]   and know every single thing about how God works
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.760]   to be able to believe in God.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.840]   It was John Wesley who said something famous,
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.640]   which was, "You don't need a complete understanding
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.520]   "of electricity to be able to experience
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.040]   "the practical benefits of using it."
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.160]   You don't need to understand exactly how currents
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.480]   and voltages and wires and all these things work.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.920]   You just actually simply need to know where the switch is
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.120]   to switch the lights on.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.280]   So it's the same idea,
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.560]   but we first have to understand
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.280]   when Jesus is the wonderful counselor,
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.480]   we're recognizing that his thoughts are higher than ours,
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.840]   his ways are higher than ours.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.320]   It is too wonderful for me.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.280]   We cannot attain it.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.200]   It is beyond explanation.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.720]   For now, we only know in part.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.400]   And that is the beginning of our journey
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.120]   of being able to put our trust in him.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.160]   So that's the first one.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:18.040]   The second one is incredible.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.320]   And I realized this about incredible
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.280]   is that I think I've gotten the meaning of incredible
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.440]   wrong over the years, just like wonderful.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.120]   So when I say, "Oh, that was incredible."
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.680]   To be fair, I use it in the same way.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.400]   That was an incredible meal.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.600]   That was an incredible time together.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.520]   Incredible, incredible.
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.880]   What does incredible mean?
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   Incredible means something that is hard to believe.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.560]   Because if you take away the word in,
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.640]   then it's like, is that a credible source?
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.920]   Credible.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.560]   So is it something that can be believed?
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.120]   But it's incredible, which means it's hard to believe.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.520]   So not only is Jesus, the wonderful counselor,
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:58.000]   hard to understand, it is also hard to believe.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.840]   Why?
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.600]   Isaiah 7 says, "A virgin will be giving birth."
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.160]   Isn't that hard to believe?
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:10.000]   It is otherworldly to even present that.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.800]   Those who are living in deep darkness get to see light.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.880]   And then Isaiah chapter nine, verse three,
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.920]   he carries on, "You have multiplied the nation.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.400]   You have increased its joy."
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.040]   Wait, what are you talking about?
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.240]   We're being suppressed by the Assyrians.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.280]   How can we be multiplied as a nation?
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.000]   And how can we increase in our joy?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.040]   It's hard to believe.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.800]   It's incredible.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.680]   It's incredible.
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.000]   And then furthermore, verse six,
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.800]   "For to us, a child is born."
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.680]   God, we're needing rescuing,
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.080]   and you're going to send us a child.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.040]   Like for real, you're not going to send us Achilles
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.720]   or a Goliath kind of sized man.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.000]   You're going to send us a child,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.560]   and the government is going to be on the shoulders
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.480]   of this child.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.320]   And this child is going to be born.
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:08.400]   Like, why don't you just come as a fully grown warrior?
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.520]   It's hard to believe.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.000]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.880]   It's incomprehensible, and it's incredible.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.440]   And this child is going to be born.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.200]   So this savior of ours is going to come from within our ranks.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.840]   It's going to come from the human race.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.440]   See, this tells me something about humanity, actually,
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.120]   that the savior chose to come into this world,
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.760]   being born, shows that Jesus,
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.240]   the wonderful counselor, is fully human.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.440]   Do you ever say this whenever you make a mistake?
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.280]   You say, "Oh, you know what?
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:41.280]   "I'm only human."
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.760]   Have you ever said that?
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.680]   When you make a mistake or you do something right?
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.520]   "You know what?
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.520]   "Put my hands up.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.760]   "I'm only human."
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.280]   You see, that is incorrect,
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.360]   because it's not because we're human that we have flaws.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.400]   It's because we have fallen.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.240]   See, Jesus was fully human, but he didn't have any flaws.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.640]   He was fully human and fully God.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:06.120]   We were created, the original design for us
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.680]   was that we would be perfect like God.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.640]   We were made in the image of God.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.160]   So we make mistakes, not because we're human,
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.240]   but because we are fallen.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.400]   And there's a slight difference there.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.360]   And Jesus embodied the two.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.480]   He is fully human and fully God.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.880]   And for those of you who are basketball fans,
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.760]   maybe Johnny is the only one who,
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:26.920]   "Yeah, we're a fallen human."
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:28.160]   You're right.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:29.800]   It's not the human part that's actually the problem.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.800]   It's the fallen part is the problem.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:32.920]   We actually have the capacity.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.640]   Jesus has shown us that if we allow him
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.280]   to live in our lives, he's shown us
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.840]   that a fully human person can be perfect.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.080]   Basketball fans, Johnny will know,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.400]   there's a guy who was probably the best dunker
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.520]   of all time, Vince Carter.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.760]   And he was described as half man, half amazing.
[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.200]   But we have here a God, a wonderful counselor
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.400]   who is fully man and fully God.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.400]   Fully man, but fully perfect.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.320]   Isn't that incredible?
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.920]   Isn't that hard to believe?
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:05.320]   Later on.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:11.280]   So a child is born and then a son is given.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.000]   A son is, it's a gift.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.480]   So Jesus is a gift to us.
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.880]   Like, why do we deserve a gift?
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.080]   It's hard to believe.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.520]   What God sacrificed his son for us.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.160]   John 3, 16, God still loved the world
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:31.440]   and he gave his only son for us.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.720]   Are you kidding me?
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.240]   That is incredible.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.560]   That is hard to believe.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.720]   Why would he do that?
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.720]   And why would the son be willing to do that?
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.280]   Why would this son who was the beginning,
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.440]   he was the beginning, he was the word.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.720]   Why did the son choose to become flesh
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.520]   and dwell among us?
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:00.880]   Jesus, the wonderful counselor is incomprehensible.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.720]   He's hard to understand.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.040]   He's incredible.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.720]   He's hard to believe.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.080]   And finally, he's hard to ignore.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.560]   If you come face to face with this wonder of a counselor,
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.760]   you should be filled with awe.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.840]   You should be filled with wonder.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.480]   So my question to you is this,
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.520]   for those of you who profess to know Jesus,
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.960]   are you still filled with awe and wonder?
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.840]   There's a favorite song of mine.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.680]   I think it's by Bethel.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.560]   It's called "Wonder."
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.680]   And the words that repeats over and again,
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:43.800]   may we never lose our wonder of Jesus.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.040]   We get so used to the Christmas lights,
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.960]   Advent's coming, oh, it's nice.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.840]   We get to do all these things.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.040]   We get to buy each other presents.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:52.520]   It gets cold.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.840]   We get to go ice skating and all these things.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.160]   But let us never lose our wonder
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.000]   and our awe for this coming King.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.040]   He is the wonderful counselor.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.360]   He is the wonder of a counselor.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.720]   And we've only just finished in Revelation,
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.360]   but if you go to Revelation,
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.680]   and if you imagine yourself
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:17.680]   in the eyes of the Apostle John,
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.440]   seeing this Jesus in Revelation 1,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:25.800]   you will be filled with awe and wonder and shock.
[00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.400]   If you go fast forward to Revelation 4,
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.640]   you see him sat on his throne
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.880]   with the 24 elders knelt before him,
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.240]   with the creatures that have eyes all over their bodies,
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.480]   that whole scene and all of them just worshiping him.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.720]   But sometimes we think Jesus is just that guy
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.080]   who's with us when we're queuing for our lunch.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.280]   And he's just a nice guy.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.240]   He's not just a nice guy.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.240]   He is a wonderful counselor.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.120]   He is a wonder of a counselor.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.280]   He is incomprehensible.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.600]   He is incredible.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.000]   And he is inspiring.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.960]   Those elders that were,
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.280]   that are knelt before his throne in Revelation 4,
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.840]   they are just bowed down, worshiping him.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:13.680]   Are we filled with that same kind of wonder?
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.240]   And does it inspire us to live in a different way?
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.760]   Just like nature inspires artists to paint
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.080]   or poets to write or composers to compose.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.320]   When we are face to face with Jesus,
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.920]   the Jesus who we're celebrating this Christmas,
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.600]   are we filled with wonder?
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:37.240]   And does it inspire us to live in a different way?
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.120]   Does Jesus still fill you with wonder?
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.520]   Has he ever filled you with wonder?
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:46.680]   Because I wonder if he's never filled you with wonder,
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.120]   I've got a feeling that you may not
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.560]   have met him properly yet.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.880]   You see, it's very important for us to still be filled.
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.960]   We should be afraid.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.480]   We should be very afraid of this supernatural,
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.640]   incomprehensible, incredible King.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:03.520]   And yet sometimes, especially for those of us
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.280]   who maybe have been a Christian for a long time,
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.720]   we just, we get used to Jesus.
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   He's the Jesus that we keep in our back pocket,
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.600]   that we bring him out whenever we need some help.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.040]   But he is the wonder of a counselor.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.200]   He is awe inspiring.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.320]   He is otherworldly.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.000]   He brings you to your knees.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.040]   If you, imagine if you saw Jesus.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.800]   Imagine if you just saw your greatest idol,
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.760]   your hero from childhood or your hero now,
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:35.120]   and you're starstruck and you're like,
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.840]   oh my goodness, this person is actually here.
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.560]   This person that I've only ever watched on TV
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.360]   or read their books, they're actually here.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.520]   Can you imagine that just excitement that you have?
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.520]   Everyone think of that person that you would love to meet.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.040]   And you finally see them.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.200]   Can you imagine the awe and wonder
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.200]   that will be filled in your heart?
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.560]   Do you have the same about Jesus?
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.640]   Or have we sold him short
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.280]   and we have we forgotten about his glory?
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.360]   Because of his humility, because of him emptying himself,
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.640]   because of him choosing to leave heaven's throne,
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.760]   to come into the earth as a baby,
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.120]   to be a child, to be born,
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.360]   have we forgotten about his glory?
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.200]   He is the wonderful counselor and he deserves to be praised.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.440]   And even if we don't, can you imagine even the rocks,
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.120]   that's what scripture says, even the rocks will cry out.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.800]   So how much should you be filled with wonder
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.160]   when you look at this coming King?
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.800]   Jesus is the wonderful counselor.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:33.640]   Those are my three points.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.400]   And the final thing is here, the word counselor.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.320]   And again, I'm challenging
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.000]   our modern day interpretation of the word.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.520]   You see, when we think about counselor now,
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.160]   we think about someone who's super nice,
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.160]   sitting there asking us nice questions and listening to us
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.000]   and processing whatever we have inside us.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.920]   But actually when the prophet Isaiah
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.000]   was writing this word counselor,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.600]   it meant a very different thing.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.440]   Counselor back then was someone who gives counsel,
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.320]   who rules, a King.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.640]   So if you were to actually translate that word
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.400]   into its more accurate meaning,
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.000]   the wonderful counselor is a wonder of a King,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   a supernatural King.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.320]   And suddenly that term just completely turns,
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.240]   that you recognize that this King is not of this world,
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.040]   that in him, Colossians 2,
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.200]   in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:33.880]   are found in Jesus.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.080]   Jesus is the counselor
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.600]   as he sits in the high council of the Godhead.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.320]   As he looks down at you and he recognizes
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.440]   that you are a sinner, that you need to be saved,
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.840]   that within their Godhead,
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.640]   they decide it is right for Jesus
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:52.080]   to step away from his throne,
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.360]   to be born in a manger so that he could save you.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:01.240]   You see, this world is currently very much lacking in wisdom
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.240]   and wouldn't you agree that we would love
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   to have more of this wonderful counselor in our lives?
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.720]   This King who rules with love and kindness
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.760]   instead of maybe the way our leaders lead today.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.520]   Have a think now, if Jesus was the ruler of this city,
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.440]   of this country or of this world,
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.320]   in whichever country you're from,
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.920]   how would things look different?
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.800]   Jesus stands for very different things
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.040]   because he is not of this world.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.760]   And he calls us to the same thing.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.440]   So imagine, and you know that verse there,
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.760]   Isaiah 9, verse 6,
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.800]   "For to us a child is born, a son is given,
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.920]   and the governments will be on his shoulders."
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.160]   Can you imagine a world
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.440]   where the governments will be on the shoulders
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.160]   of this wonderful counselor?
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.360]   Dream with me just for a second
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.000]   as our world seemingly crumbles around.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.840]   Can you imagine what our world would look like
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.920]   if this child that is born, this son that is given,
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.120]   the government shall be upon his shoulders?
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.560]   What would it look like?
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:17.040]   Leaders may stop dealing in half truths, compromises,
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.920]   because Jesus declares and deals with complete truth.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.760]   Leaders will stop looking to see what they can get
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.480]   from the people they're leading
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.320]   because Jesus chose to give to the people that he's leading.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.280]   Leaders will look to be stopped to being just served,
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.800]   but will start serving those they're leading.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.840]   Jesus will, leaders who are looking
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.280]   to build their own empire will stop
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.760]   because Jesus chose to wash people's feet.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.240]   Jesus turns things upside down.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.160]   Leaders that get more inaccessible
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.000]   as they get higher up in society.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:53.280]   If their government was on the shoulders of Jesus,
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.960]   Jesus was Emmanuel, God with us,
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.800]   accessible to every human being,
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.280]   young and old, sinner or saint.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.360]   Jesus was God with us.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.960]   Earthly leaders look for prominence.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.040]   Jesus sought to be anonymous.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.040]   See, Jesus right now is clearly not in charge
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.720]   of the halls of Washington and London and Moscow.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:22.440]   So how can we ever believe in a government
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.120]   that will be on his shoulders?
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.760]   Doesn't seem feasible.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.880]   It seems incomprehensible.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.760]   It seems incredible.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:35.040]   But Jesus isn't seeking to take over an earthly kingdom.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:38.040]   His kingdom isn't of this world.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.960]   He doesn't desire to control the powers of this world.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.040]   He was already tempted with that by the enemy.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:43.960]   He didn't want it.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.800]   Jesus' desire is for his kingdom to rule in your heart.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.960]   Jesus doesn't desire to govern institutions.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.560]   Jesus desires individuals,
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.760]   individuals like you and I.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:06.520]   So I want you to ask as I finish now,
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:10.000]   is Jesus the ruler of your life?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.640]   Do you seek counsel from him?
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.840]   Is he the king that is ruling over your life?
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:21.960]   And your concept of Jesus, your perspective,
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.880]   or your perception of Jesus,
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.080]   is it one that is like,
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.160]   Jesus, you are so high and above, I can't,
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.840]   you blow my mind.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:31.400]   You are that incomprehensible.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.120]   And it is so hard to believe
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.760]   that you would be born of a virgin,
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.360]   that you would be God's own son,
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.840]   sacrificing his life for me.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.200]   It doesn't make sense.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.640]   Yet are you inspired by this picture of Jesus
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.040]   to change your life, to submit to him,
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:54.240]   to submit to his rule, because he is worth it.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.120]   Why?
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.960]   Because he showed you and I the greatest love
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.200]   that one could ever show.
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.960]   A king, the prince of peace
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.720]   that we can see later on in this passage,
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.160]   he chose to sacrifice himself to rescue you.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:17.680]   And this Christmas, not only are we celebrating the advent,
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   the coming of baby Jesus,
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.320]   we are also celebrating the fact
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:26.840]   that this baby did not stay in the manger.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.200]   He also did not stay in the grave.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:35.400]   And that he shed his blood for you and I.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.720]   So it's very appropriate for us,
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.960]   and even in this evening, to be filled with that joy,
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.240]   that Christmas is coming, that we celebrate Jesus,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.000]   that we get to be with family,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.440]   that we get to just do all the things
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.840]   that we love in this season,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.560]   and we can be filled with joy,
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.000]   but also be filled with gratefulness
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.720]   that this baby in a manger,
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.200]   that this son that was given,
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.600]   this child that was born,
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.960]   ended up sacrificing himself for us,
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.560]   and is now seated high on his throne
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.360]   as the wonderful counsellor,
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.880]   the wonder of a king,
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.040]   the supernatural ruler of this world.
