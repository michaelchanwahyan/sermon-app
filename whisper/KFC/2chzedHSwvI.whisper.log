[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hello everyone.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.880]   It's great to be sharing a word with you tonight.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.560]   I'm really excited because we'll be talking about the church in Philadelphia.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.200]   So over the last few weeks, we've been going through the book of Revelations where we've
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.580]   seen so far five churches.
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.760]   And let's just say that the Lord have had a little bit more negative comments and judgment
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.680]   than we would have expected.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.400]   And a lot of them were quite negatively commented by the Lord.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.760]   And some of it was that they've lost their first love, which is the love that they had
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.000]   for the Lord.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.440]   And others, they have been a corrupted church.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.720]   I mean, Smyrna was a better one where they were persecuted, but they've stood firm.
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.080]   So we've seen that as we're looking at the different churches, we wonder for a moment,
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.640]   is there any church that the Lord is pleased with?
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.640]   And then we come to the church in Philadelphia and we're like, yay, because this is the church
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.880]   where the Lord has only given positive comments.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.500]   And not only that, but the rewards and the promises that he has in this chapter.
[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.320]   So as a church, we should really open up our ears because how is it possible that even
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.480]   though no church is perfect on earth, and yet the Lord is able to give such good comments
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.560]   about it.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.720]   So let us learn together so then we can also be a blameless church in His end times.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:56.160]   So let's begin by reading from Revelations 3, verse 7 to 8.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:04.960]   And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, the words of the Holy One, the true
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.680]   One, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.000]   I know your works, behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   shut.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.600]   I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.720]   my name.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.760]   Now you know, after we read it, we're like, yes, we kind of get every single word, but
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.360]   no, I'm not quite sure what the Lord wants to say.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.600]   I mean, what is the Lord saying here?
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.760]   Well, let's begin by looking at Philadelphia.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.760]   Where is it?
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.200]   Well, it's located southeast of Sardis, which we've looked at last week.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.160]   And basically it's in a territory where there's a lot of earthquakes.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.600]   And it was so great that many times all the houses would break down and they'll have to
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   move out.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.240]   So it's a very unstable city for the people to live in.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.600]   And not only that, but then the population is very small because they didn't, it wasn't
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.840]   stable, and so they stayed away most of the time.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.000]   But the church that was in there, Philadelphia church, was actually praised by the Lord.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.600]   And as we look further, we see that each time the Lord would describe Himself before He
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.200]   would talk about what He wanted to say to the church.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.120]   But interestingly, this time, the description here, as you see in verse seven, was actually
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.840]   not a vision from chapter one, because all the other churches, when He described Himself,
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.080]   we could see bits and pieces from chapter one.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.520]   But here it's standalone.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.120]   And it's very special.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.240]   He chose four different ways to describe Himself.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.280]   And the very first one is, this letter was written by whom?
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.360]   The Holy One.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.200]   Now when we hear the Holy One, who does it describe?
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.440]   It can only describe one, divine God.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:16.200]   And so in the very first description, He says, "I'm the divine God that's about to give these
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   words."
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.640]   And second, He says, "The true one."
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.880]   Because at that time, there were many gods, and people don't really know which one is
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.880]   true.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:31.320]   But He says, "I'm the true one, not a false one, one that you can trust in."
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.320]   And then He continues to describe Himself as the one who holds the key of David, who
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.720]   opens and no one can shut, and who shuts and no one can open.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.440]   We're not quite sure what door He's shutting, or what door He's opening at this moment.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.760]   But it's actually a direct reference to Isaiah chapter 22, verse 22.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.520]   If you read it, you'll see that it's almost the same.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.240]   "And I will place on His shoulder the key of the house of David.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.640]   He shall open and none shall shut, and He shall shut and none shall open."
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.040]   Because of the similarity, we know that it is drawing a reference.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:17.720]   So if we understood Isaiah 22 here, it's going to allow us to understand why is it that He
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.160]   would describe Himself this way.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.480]   And in Isaiah 22 here, actually King Hezekiah, he actually had chief stewards that would
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.680]   look after all the treasures that he had.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.600]   And here he's saying that, "I'm passing it on to a new steward."
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:44.120]   And so when Jesus uses this verse to describe Himself, He's saying, "I have the key to
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.960]   the treasures."
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:52.640]   And for the stewards here, He has the key to an earthly kingdom.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.480]   But when Jesus is referring it to Himself, He's saying that, "I hold the key to which
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.480]   kingdom?
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.880]   The kingdom of God."
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:10.080]   And so can you imagine, just at the beginning, just the very first line in Philadelphia,
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.160]   He's telling the people that, "I'm the divine God.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.040]   I'm the true one.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.760]   I'm the one who holds the key to the kingdom of God, and I have access to it.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.320]   It's at my disposal.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.320]   And this God is about to speak."
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.240]   And I don't know about you, but if this God was about to speak, I would think, "Oh my
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.160]   gosh, He's all the way up here.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.080]   Whatever it is that He's about to say, I would never measure up."
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:54.120]   And yet, miraculously, Jesus here, our Lord right here, says nothing bad about this church.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:58.200]   And so what does He say?
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.440]   He says, "I know your works.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.760]   Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:14.800]   I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.680]   my name."
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.080]   And so interestingly here, the Lord says, "I know your works," but He actually doesn't
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.600]   tell us.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   What did they do?
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.720]   I mean, we try to look around, but He doesn't say.
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.440]   It just seems like the content didn't matter as much.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:37.840]   But what matter is the Lord wanted to emphasize that I have my eyes on you.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.160]   I see everything that you do.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.000]   That's the message that He wants to tell the church in Philadelphia.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.800]   But why would He say that?
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.200]   And He says that, "I have set before you an open door."
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.000]   Remember in the last verse, He just says, "The kingdom of God and all His treasures
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.960]   is at His disposal."
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:07.120]   And now He's saying, "I've seen your work, and I'm opening that door for you.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:14.160]   The door to the kingdom of heaven, the door with treasures and blessings, I am opening
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.200]   it for you."
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.760]   And so by the time we get to this verse, we'll be like, "Oh my gosh, the Lord is
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.120]   pouring out to this church."
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.920]   Now He could have just stopped there.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.260]   "Behold, I've set before you an open door," and that would be enough, right?
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:37.320]   But He adds on, "which no one is able to shut."
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:42.480]   Can you imagine the amount of blessing that the Lord wants to pour out in the church of
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.440]   Philadelphia?
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.640]   And then He says, "I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept My
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.160]   word and have not denied My name."
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.160]   Now why is it all of a sudden He mentions this little power?
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:03.200]   Well, the Lord wants to tell them that it isn't because you're this spiritual giant,
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.000]   this great church, and that's why you're able to do everything.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.620]   It is because even though you only have a little power, or some commentaries even say
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:20.080]   because there are very few of you, even though there were such limitations in what you have,
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.240]   you were still able to keep My words and not deny His name.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.000]   And because of that, the Lord is blessing him.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.400]   And so it comes to our first point I want to share with you, which is the Lord opens
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.640]   doors for the faithful.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:47.560]   It isn't because the church of Philadelphia had more people, had more resources than other
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.000]   churches.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.500]   It wasn't because of that.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.300]   And it wasn't because of what they've done, like they've detailed out, "All right, you
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:10:01.900]   have done 30 evangelistical meetings, and you've gone to like 100 mission trips."
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.440]   It wasn't that.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.920]   He didn't name any of those things.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.880]   But that the Lord was pleased because of what?
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.680]   This church, it was faithful.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:19.200]   Even though they had a little bit, they were faithful.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:25.460]   And because of that, the Lord is willing to pour out to this church.
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:32.800]   And I like to think, and I strongly and truly believe that our church is like that.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.280]   But we are a church where the Lord blesses us.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:43.240]   I mean, just thinking back, a while ago it was our 35th anniversary, and just seeing
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:49.960]   how many faithful servants we've had in this church, where they've worked hard.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:55.540]   They've started with not even a building, but just meeting here and there.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:01.960]   And then slowly, the Lord opened its door, and He has blessed us.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:08.760]   Now with a building, first one floor, and then He blesses us with another floor.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.240]   Was it because we were more powerful?
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:17.160]   No, we're just like this church, with little power.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:24.300]   And yet, because the Lord wishes to bless, it keeps on blessing the people.
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.560]   And also, I mean, just seeing how He has grown.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.280]   We've started with just the Cantonese, and now we've got the Mandarin congregation.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:39.120]   And look at us, we're a product of that too, the English congregation.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.560]   And it's because the Lord has continued to open the door.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:49.440]   And this year, even though with COVID, we have Titus Fellowship, who's now addressing
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.840]   to the high school kids.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:12:01.040]   And we also have the English Mentorship Program, who's helping the local secondary schoolers
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.200]   to be able to learn English and know about God.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.060]   And if you're not involved in that and you want to, you can let us know.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.360]   We definitely need more helpers.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.040]   And it's because there are so many faithful servants.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:22.800]   And at the same time, just today, you see we're having a baby room that's coming soon.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:28.200]   And I could see the Lord is opening His door.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:35.240]   And that is where we need to continue to be a faithful servant of His.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.840]   Now let's continue to read on.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:44.360]   In Revelations chapter 3, we continue on with verse 9 to 10.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:51.840]   "Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, who say that they are Jews and are
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.800]   not, but lie.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:00.000]   Behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet, and they will learn that
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.320]   I have loved you.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:09.120]   Because you have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:17.680]   trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth."
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.640]   Now we see this, we're like synagogue of Satan.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:24.040]   But synagogues for Jews?
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:29.600]   Now if that was going through your mind, then you might have some background to the history
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.640]   and also at that time.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:38.680]   What happened was during that time, most likely there were enough Jewish people, Jews, in
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.920]   the place of Philadelphia, where they had their own synagogue.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:49.040]   But instead of serving the Lord and welcoming Christ, they actually persecuted Christ to
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.240]   begin with.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.240]   And of course, they're also persecuting the Christians there.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.800]   And hence, the Lord is calling them synagogue of Satan.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.480]   Now if you remember, in Revelations chapter 2, verse 9, we've also seen a very similar
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:09.320]   verse where they say, "I know your tribulation and your poverty, and the slander of those
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:15.560]   who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."
[00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:22.960]   So also in the church of Smyrna, where there was a lot of persecution from the Jews, the
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.560]   Lord have used the same words, which meant that right now, at that time in Philadelphia,
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.840]   they were also going through persecutions from the Jews.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.360]   Now you might wonder, why is it that they're Jews but are not?
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.160]   I mean, are they talking about ethnicity?
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.920]   Is this an ethnic issue?
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.840]   Now we think it's not.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.760]   I'm pretty sure that those people were born Jews.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:54.160]   It is more of Jews in the heart.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:01.360]   And if we look at Romans chapter 2, 28 to 29, we see that, "For no one," this is Apostle
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:08.480]   Paul saying, "For no one is a Jew who is merely one outward, nor is circumcision outward and
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.480]   physical.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:15.920]   The Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the spirit, not
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.600]   by the letter."
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:26.280]   So as we see, we can see that in this church in Philadelphia, there were a group of Jews
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.920]   that were persecuting the Christians there.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.120]   And what does the Lord say?
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.440]   The Lord says, "I will make them bow down before your feet."
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.960]   Now bowing down before your feet at that time wasn't like worshipping God.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.840]   This is not the kind that Jesus is referring to.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.360]   This kind of bowing down is when an enemy of yours has been defeated.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.720]   They will bow down before you.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.560]   Now interestingly enough, you know, Jesus could have just stopped there, you know, make
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:05.160]   them bow down, or even say, make them bow down before your feet because I love you.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.760]   That would make sense.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:12.120]   But here it says, "And they will learn that I have loved you."
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.520]   And so we're a little bit confused, you know, why is it that, why do you think Jesus put
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.480]   that in?
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:27.280]   Now it's most likely they're making a reference to Romans chapter 11, 13 to 14, where it's
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:37.200]   saying that they are, Jesus most likely wanted the Jews to be jealous, to be jealous at the
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.440]   love that the Lord has given mostly to Gentiles at that time, because not a lot of Jews have
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.520]   converted to Christians at that moment.
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.300]   And they wanted to make them jealous.
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:54.240]   And so this verse says, "Now I'm speaking to you Gentiles, inasmuch then as I am an
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:59.880]   apostle to the Gentiles," because Apostle Paul was mainly spreading the gospel to the
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:07.560]   Gentiles, "I magnify my ministry in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous and
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.640]   thus save some of them."
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:16.760]   And so here most likely Jesus is saying that, not only will I make them bow down to you,
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.520]   but then I'll make them know that I have loved you so that they will have a chance to turn
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.800]   back.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.760]   And so we look at this and we see that in the next verse, Jesus says, "Because you
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.840]   have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial that
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:45.160]   is coming on to the whole earth, to try those who dwell on the earth."
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.240]   And I will look at this and we know that Jesus is not only saying that, "I will deliver
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:56.080]   you from your enemies," not only that, but he says that in the hour of trial.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.240]   And we don't know when that hour of trial is.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:05.320]   But in that hour when the whole world has been trialed, and some people might think
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:11.700]   it's COVID and we're not drawing any conclusions, but isn't there a time when the whole world
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.480]   is undergoing a hard time?
[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.600]   Says that they will be protected.
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.120]   Now in here, some people have different theories about how to look at this.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:31.720]   It could be that when Jesus says that they will be kept, that I will keep you from the
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:39.200]   hour of trial, it's possible, some say that it is a rapture before the tribulation, before
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.800]   the great hardship.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:46.040]   And there are other sayings that it is actually not taking them away from the world, but that
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:51.440]   even though they're going through it, that they will be protected by the Lord.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.960]   So now what does this mean for us?
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.440]   Because it's like that in Philadelphia.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440]   But what about us?
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:04.080]   I mean, in everyday life, we're still going through some sort of trial.
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.680]   Rather people are persecuting us, well, we don't have to die for it, thank God, but persecuting
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:16.360]   us because of our faith, or even, and we might go through a hardship in our life, maybe with
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:24.960]   career, maybe with our health, with our relationship, and those are also hard for us to go through.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:31.000]   Or maybe we might quarrel with someone and we don't know what to do with it.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.880]   And here, the Lord is showing us that He is a Lord who vindicates and who protects us.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:47.920]   And so as we are faithful to Him, as we continue to follow His words, and as we continue to
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:54.440]   not deny His name, He will be the one that vindicates for us and the one that protects
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:59.920]   us, even in the hour of trial.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.280]   And so it should give us Christians great comfort when we're going through hardships
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.320]   that the Lord will vindicate and protect us.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:14.520]   And so let us read on in verse 11 to 13.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.640]   "I'm coming soon.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.680]   Hold fast what you have so that no one may seize your crown.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:28.200]   The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:35.000]   Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my Lord and the name of
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:43.520]   the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from my God out of heaven and my
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.200]   own new name.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.640]   He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:56.160]   Now notice that the Lord says, "I'm coming," but actually in the few previous churches
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.160]   when He said that, you probably don't want it to happen.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:05.680]   Because the previous churches, like to the church in Ephesus, He says, "I will come
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.600]   to you and remove your lampstand."
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.240]   It's like, I'm going to come to you and close down your church.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.120]   And or to the church of Pergamum, it says, "I'm coming to make war with you with the
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.680]   sword of my mouth."
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.200]   And with the church of Sardis, it says, "You'll not know the hour that I come.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.880]   I'll come like a thief."
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.880]   Now in all these cases, it's bringing on judgment into the church.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:37.320]   And yet here, when He tells the church in Philadelphia, "I am coming," He's coming
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.320]   for them.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:46.000]   He's coming and He's asking them to hold fast, just hold on tight a little bit longer
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.440]   so that no one will take their crown.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:58.160]   And so this is a very image that when we are conquerors, we're going to get this crown.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:02.520]   And this crown that has been talked about here has been talked about in John chapter
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:08.120]   two, verse eight as well, where He says, "Watch yourselves that you do not lose what we have
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.800]   accomplished, but that you may receive the full reward."
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.960]   So it's like going through our lives.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.720]   As we're faithful, we will get that crown, that reward.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:23.280]   And if we continue and persist, then the Lord has rewards for us.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.960]   And what are those rewards?
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:31.000]   And we look at those, it's like, I know, it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense for
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.760]   us to want a pillar in the temple, but it'll make more sense in eternal sense.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.400]   Let me tell you why.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:43.360]   Because a pillar in the temple at that time meant that the honored people's names would
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.120]   be engraved in these pillars.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:51.700]   And remember in Philadelphia, they were actually in a place where there were a lot of earthquakes.
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.600]   So what that meant was their home was always shaken.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.560]   And today they might be well here, but the next day they might need to move out and come
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.400]   back and rebuild it.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:09.240]   But to them, this will be an eternal home, immovable, unshakable.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:13.800]   And so this is what the Lord is promising them as a reward.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.840]   You, I will make Him.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.840]   So they would be these pillars in the temple of my God.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.240]   And never shall we go out.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:25.000]   And I write on Him the name of my Lord.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.480]   Now to be written, to belong to the Lord meant that, to have His name on them means that
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.800]   they would belong to the Lord.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:44.960]   And at the very end, it also says that they will have the name of the city of my God,
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.120]   the new Jerusalem written there.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120]   What does that mean?
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.240]   It means that they're going to get a new citizenship.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.440]   It's not a citizenship on earth.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.760]   It's a citizenship in heaven, eternal, forever.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.660]   And that's what the Lord is promising them.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.720]   And finally it says that they will have my own name.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:12.680]   So this really is a reward of how they are going to have a place, a citizenship, that
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.080]   they belong to the Lord in new Jerusalem.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:23.600]   And of course, we end this passage with, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.800]   says to the churches."
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:31.200]   And so what we see in the last three verses is that the Lord is a Lord who rewards His
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.200]   faithful ones.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   And we have seen that throughout the five churches so far, and this is our sixth church.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:48.280]   And we know that the Lord asks of the Philadelphians to be faithful and continue on doing that.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.040]   Now I know it's not easy because we don't even know.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.000]   What does it mean to be faithful every day?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.600]   I mean, are we faithful every day?
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.160]   How do we know we're faithful every day?
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.100]   What does it look like to be faithful every day?
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:04.920]   What does it look like?
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.560]   Have you thought about it?
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:13.080]   Are you faithful to the Lord?
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.240]   How do we know?
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:23.080]   And so I want to share a little bit about what faithfulness might look like in our everyday
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.000]   life.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.660]   Faithfulness is not being this gigantic spiritual giant where you can memorize the Bible verse
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.120]   by verse.
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.400]   And it isn't meaning like you come to church every single week.
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.400]   That makes you faithful.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:46.880]   But what is faithful is that we would be able to do with what we have and give it to the
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.880]   Lord.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.960]   Let me tell you what it was like.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:59.800]   There was a time in my life when I shared a little bit in another sermon where because
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:07.040]   of a failed relationship, I've also gone south with my career because I quit my job back
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.040]   then.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:12.680]   I was in a really bad emotional state at that time.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:18.280]   And it was so bad that I didn't even want to live, let alone be a Christian.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:22.000]   And I thought to myself, what's the point?
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.560]   What's the point of being a Christian?
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.440]   I've been a Christian like 20 years of my life at that time.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.080]   But things are just still not working out.
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:35.920]   I mean, I go to church, I do these, and I pray.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.220]   What's the point?
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:47.040]   And I really thought about maybe this whole Christian thing, God.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.880]   I can put it down.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.880]   Maybe.
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:54.880]   And I just thought, you know, in those moments of hardship, it just doesn't seem to make
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.840]   sense to keep going.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:11.120]   And yet, the little power, the very little power in my heart knew that.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.520]   But the Lord is real.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.360]   I don't know how it's going to happen, but I know He's real.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.600]   What can I do?
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:24.120]   Because I have such little power.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:30.720]   And it was at that time, and there was nothing to do, that I just did the only thing I could
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   do.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.600]   And do you know what that was?
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.080]   To pray.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.320]   That takes zero effort, almost.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.600]   You can lie on your bed, you can be anywhere, and just pray.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.400]   But because of that prayer, things started changing.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:53.840]   And I wouldn't even be able to flip the Bible open, because I was in such a bad state.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.120]   And did you know what I had done?
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:59.000]   Just what I could.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.200]   And what was I able to do?
[00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:08.640]   I was able to take my phone out, turn on to YouTube, and listen to a sermon.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.240]   You know, that takes about this motion.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:17.760]   That was the only ounce of effort I had.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:23.760]   And the Lord opened the doors with just that little effort.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:30.960]   And I think within a year, I've heard a thousand sermons, about three a day.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:38.920]   And that started to change me, because the Lord started to open up His doors to heaven.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.840]   It started pouring down, and I finally began to have a relationship with Him.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.080]   To know Him in a more personal way.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:50.520]   And then I began to be able to read the Bible.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:56.040]   And because He opened the door for me, suddenly the Bible verses that I never understood,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.760]   it just popped up.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.600]   It just made sense.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.160]   And I didn't know why.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:10.600]   It was the opening of the doors to heaven that the Lord chose to open.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:19.720]   And so I believe that when the Lord asks us to keep on being faithful, He's not asking—
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.320]   He's just meeting us where we are.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:28.960]   If you're going through a hard time with your career, and if you can't find out what to
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.920]   do next, maybe you can't even get a job.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:36.760]   Maybe you're going through a tough time in your relationship, or you're not even sure
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.640]   if your family likes you.
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.800]   Like if there's a lot of things that we can go through in our lives.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:50.000]   But the Lord says, if we're faithful with just the ounce that we have, whatever it may
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:04.200]   be in your case, He is able to open that door, and He will give us access to the heavens.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:10.280]   And so today, as we read these verses, we see that the Lord wishes to bless us.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.480]   And He wants to open the door for the faithful ones.
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:21.480]   And He will vindicate for us and protect us if we continue to be faithful, doing whatever
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:25.760]   it is that we have, the little ounces.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.760]   And the Lord will reward us.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:35.420]   And so, you know, sometimes we want to think, do we want to be working our lives, living
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:43.960]   through our lives for an extra footage in our apartment, or do we want to live our lives
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:50.640]   so that we would be the pillar in the eternal heaven?
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:57.680]   Do we want to have a citizenship elsewhere in the world where we get to live a different
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.800]   lifestyle, or do we want a citizenship in heaven?
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:09.840]   And with God's name written on us, with a new name, a new status that He would give
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.320]   us?
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.280]   And I think most of us would answer that we want the latter ones.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:23.520]   And so let us continue to really continue to be faithful in Him.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.880]   Whatever you are, whatever stage you're in with your relationship with God, He wants
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.140]   to meet us there.
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:39.800]   And when we give that little ounce of faithfulness, He will pour out to us, and He'll vindicate
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.780]   for us in whatever situation we're in.
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:46.420]   And the reward is also waiting for us.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:51.100]   And so Jesus Himself alone is enough for us.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:57.900]   And let us remember to never turn back, even in the hardest times in our lives, that we
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:07.180]   will press on, knowing that Jesus is enough, and that He's with us, and He loves us, and
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:09.020]   He'll meet us where we are.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.780]   Let us pray together.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:23.460]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you that even though we're weak, even though we have very
[00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:32.140]   little faith sometimes, that Father, you will meet us where we are, and you're just willing
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:42.260]   and wanting to open up heavens for us, to protect us in our hard times, and to reward
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.260]   us.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:48.060]   And Father, we pray that in our walk with you, in our relationship, in our journey with
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:57.100]   you, Father, that you would continue to help us, that whenever any of us cries out, Father,
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:00.500]   that we'll know that you love us.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:09.980]   I sense that some people here today may not feel that the Lord loves them.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:19.180]   And Father, I pray for that truth to sink in, that it is your love that draws us.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:23.960]   It is this relationship that you yearn for us.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:32.220]   And so Father, we're praying a special blessing for those who don't feel you close, who don't
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.860]   feel your presence in their lives now.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:43.700]   We pray that your Holy Spirit will fill them, and that you would help them to give that
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:50.420]   little ounce of faith, and continue their journey with you, and to love you.
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.500]   Father God, thank you for your love for us.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:58.940]   Your love, your guidance, and your salvation is enough for us.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.380]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
