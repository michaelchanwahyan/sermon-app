[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Do you know something?
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.060]   This is my first live sermon here since November the 26th.
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.200]   I'm so pleased that Sandra and I could be back here with our church family.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.160]   As I said last week, we've missed you and have been so grateful for your love, your
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.540]   support and your prayers.
[00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.980]   It's been quite a journey for us.
[00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.680]   And tonight, we begin another journey together.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:48.140]   One that will take us, as Johnny said, from now until Easter.
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.580]   Talking of journeys, I heard a story about Albert Einstein, the famous scientist.
[00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.580]   You know, E=mc2.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.140]   He was traveling from Princeton, New Jersey on a train when the conductor came down the
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.460]   aisle punching tickets.
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.020]   Einstein reached into his vest pocket.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.200]   He couldn't find his ticket.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.420]   So he reached into his trouser pockets.
[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.820]   Sounds like me, Sandra, doesn't it?
[00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.260]   It still wasn't there.
[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.340]   He looked in his briefcase, but still couldn't find it.
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.620]   He looked on the seat next to him, but no sign of the tickets.
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.940]   The conductor was a very kind man.
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.080]   He said, "Dr. Einstein, I know who you are.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.780]   We all know who you are.
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.860]   I'm sure you bought a ticket.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.300]   Don't worry about it."
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.500]   The conductor just carried on his way, punching tickets.
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.740]   But just before he went to the next car, he turned around and he saw the great scientist
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.660]   on his hands and his knees looking for his ticket.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.340]   The conductor rushed back and said, "Dr. Einstein, don't worry.
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.100]   I know who you are.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.220]   No problem.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.820]   You don't need a ticket."
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:32.860]   Einstein said, "Young man, I too know who I am.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:40.700]   What I don't know is where I'm going."
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.220]   I think we all ask ourselves that question, don't we, from time to time?
[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.460]   Where am I going?
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:03:01.460]   Today we begin a journey, a journey that will last eight weeks and will take us to Easter.
[00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.620]   I mean, we all like journeys, don't we?
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.620]   Especially you, Johnny.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.500]   We all like journeys.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:20.060]   I want to put some photos up of a journey I took to London in 2019.
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.660]   As many of you know, I support Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.980]   Yes, I know it's sad.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:36.300]   Now thanks to my friends at AIA in Hong Kong, I was able to not only visit the new stadium,
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.820]   but actually to go to the training ground to meet the players, including, as you see,
[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.140]   Harry Kane and Sun Ho Ming.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:54.460]   It was the experience of a lifetime for a lifetime Spurs fan.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:03.620]   But the only way I can share it with you is through social media posts like this.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.220]   You weren't there.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:16.420]   It was a big thrill for me, but I experienced it alone.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:26.860]   But the key to this journey is that we are going on it together.
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:35.360]   And experiences always beat those that we do on our own.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.580]   I want to put another picture.
[00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.720]   I want to roll the clock forward a few months.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:48.340]   A few months after that, a group of us from KFCI went to Israel and Jordan.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.900]   Someone's learned Cantonese at the back.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.380]   Is that the baby speaking Cantonese already?
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:06.140]   But the trip here, you will see us outside the empty tomb in Jerusalem.
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.220]   It was so special.
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.100]   Why?
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.420]   Because we did it together.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.460]   We still talk about it now.
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.340]   We still ask, when can we go again?
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.540]   PS, watch this space.
[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:37.220]   Indeed, I have to tell you, a few minutes after this picture was taken, we sat around
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.500]   and we did communion together.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.340]   A truly shared experience.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.020]   And for this one, we are joining hundreds of thousands of Christ followers around the
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.160]   globe.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.420]   We will be journeying together.
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:05.140]   A small acorn that was birthed here in Hong Kong by a small group of international churches
[00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:12.620]   around five years ago, that has dramatically expanded to the local church, churches of
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:20.140]   different denominations, to churches employing various languages, and lastly, geographically,
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.860]   to churches across Asia and indeed the world.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:31.420]   I heard that people in 165 countries last year actually took part in some way in the
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.420]   One Campaign.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:43.380]   The acorns that were planted have grown into big oak trees.
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:50.060]   All inspired by a prayer, all inspired by a prayer that Jesus prayed in John chapter
[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.220]   17.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.700]   Let me set the scene.
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:04.800]   The scene is that Jesus is literally hours before his death.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:16.620]   The cruel barbaric death normally reserved for a common criminal on a dirty wooden cross.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.940]   He prays to his father.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:36.740]   And then in verse 21, he says these words, "That they may all be one, just as you, Father,
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:45.700]   are in me and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.900]   you have sent me."
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.180]   This leads me to a question.
[00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:04.700]   What would you be praying hours before your torture and a painful, bloody death?
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.820]   I guess I'd be praying something like, "Couldn't you just dumb down the pain?"
[00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:18.580]   Or maybe, "God, are you sure this is the only way?"
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:23.180]   But Jesus had a different priority.
[00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:30.700]   The unity of his children was the thing that was upper mind in his mind and in his heart.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:37.540]   And that is why we begin this journey today.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:46.940]   I believe that God is saying to his church, "This is a time for building bridges and not
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:48.940]   building walls.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:59.500]   Indeed, it's a time to tear down walls and replace them with bridges."
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:08.220]   I believe this congregation is called to be bridge builders.
[00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:18.300]   As a minister for this church, I want to share with you my heart for one church.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:24.580]   The truth is, I've really felt a heavy burden in this area since I started looking at the
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.340]   early church in the book of Acts.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.100]   We looked at it last year, do you remember?
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:37.020]   I've been comparing the early church in Jerusalem in AD 30 with the early believers sharing
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.540]   their possessions, giving to those in needs.
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.020]   I see numbers being added daily.
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.460]   I see miracles happening to such an extent that people wanted to get under Peter's shadow
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.540]   that they might be healed.
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:06.140]   In Acts 2, verse 1, "At the beginning, when the day of Pentecost came, they were all together
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.140]   in one place."
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.940]   This is an interesting word, the Greek word for "in one place."
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:24.000]   Homophobidon is translated in other versions as "with one accord."
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:31.340]   They were in the same place spiritually as well as physically.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:37.300]   What is basically saying today, we know we're all in the same room here today, we're physically
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.300]   in one place.
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:44.780]   But are we of one accord?
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:51.140]   It means being unanimous, having mutual consent, being in agreement, having group unity, having
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:57.060]   one mind and purpose.
[00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:07.080]   Now note, unity is not uniformity.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.100]   We do not have to become like each other.
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.460]   Thank goodness.
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.060]   There is a richness in diversity.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:24.740]   As I look, I see a richness, I see a diversity in this room.
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:34.860]   We're not called to uniformity, but we are called to unity.
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:40.580]   Uniformity is a form of pressure from without.
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.820]   We see it in the cults, don't we?
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.100]   Where everyone is told, "You've got to be like this.
[00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.380]   You've got to act like this.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.900]   You've got to dress like this," etc.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:12:01.660]   But unity, pure unity must come from within and needs grace, the fruit of the Spirit.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:08.180]   I need to tell you right now, if we're going to preserve the unity of the Spirit, we must
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:12.180]   possess the necessary spiritual graces.
[00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.620]   We can look either to the fruit of the Spirit in Galatians 5, but the fruit of the Spirit
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:23.580]   is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:30.380]   Or to the list that Paul has kindly included in the fourth chapter of his letter to the
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.580]   Ephesians.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:38.620]   He says this, "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:47.300]   of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness and patience,
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:53.060]   bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:58.340]   of peace."
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:05.100]   If one and the one campaign is going to move beyond a Lent Bible plan, we're not just looking
[00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:06.940]   for a Lent Bible plan.
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.340]   We don't want in 40 days time, go back to the way we were.
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.500]   This is what we need.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:18.500]   Paul tells us seven things, humility, gentleness, patience, forbearing.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:28.500]   He says, "Bearing with one another in love, love, eagerness to maintain unity and peace."
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.660]   That's our job description.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.140]   And Paul seems to sum it up very well in Colossians 3.15.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:36.580]   I've put it on the screen.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:45.560]   It says, "And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you are called
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:48.180]   in one body."
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:53.500]   I think this verse says it all.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:14:00.700]   Now it's true that we will not agree on everything.
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:07.020]   We don't want to be a church where we agree on everything.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:17.380]   But it's essential that we do agree on foundational truths.
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:25.340]   And dear Paul helps us again by listing seven, that number again, in verses four to six.
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:31.380]   "There is one body and one spirit, just as you are called to one hope that belongs to
[00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:38.140]   your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.020]   and through all and in all."
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:47.180]   As an aside, he seems to be promoting the one campaign, doesn't he?
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:58.420]   He talks about one body, one spirit, one hope in our calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.900]   one God and Father.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:09.060]   My friends, seven essential things that we are to agree on.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:17.180]   Paul is concerned that we do not break the spirit of unity by agreeing to false teaching.
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:21.900]   He does not recommend peace at any price.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:29.940]   On the other hand, purity of teaching itself does not produce spiritual unity, which is
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.740]   why Paul joins the two in verse 15.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.020]   I love this.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:41.140]   Ephesians 4.15, "Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.100]   Him who is the head into Christ."
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.780]   We found the answer.
[00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.820]   Don't you just love the Word of God?
[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:57.860]   The key to keeping the unity of spirit, the key to ensuring this is not just a great Lent
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:04.300]   program, but a continuing work of God in our city.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:09.980]   The truth in love.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.140]   In love.
[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.980]   The truth.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:24.260]   Let us pray that this will be the 2023 reality in Hong Kong and the Christian church as a
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.260]   whole.
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:34.020]   Then I believe we will start to see things that not only match, but would surpass the
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:40.980]   early church in Acts 30, that we would truly be one.
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:47.100]   And God has laid on our hearts in conjunction with all the other churches taking part in
[00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:54.420]   the One Campaign, an even bigger, some might say audacious vision.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.420]   We call it the 2033.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.420]   Sorry, that's the 2033.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.420]   We've got the date wrong there.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:04.460]   2033 vision.
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:11.860]   Every tribe, every tongue, every nation.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.460]   Every tribe, every tongue, every nation.
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.540]   Here's some staggering facts.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:27.340]   Earth's population numbers are in the billions and it's growing every day.
[00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:34.500]   There are over 7,100 languages spoken all over the world.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:45.860]   70% of people alive today primarily learn through audible communication and 50% cannot
[00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.420]   read at a functional level.
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:57.220]   How will they ever come to hear the gospel?
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:04.020]   Faith Comes By Hearing, who are sponsoring the One Campaign, have come alongside the worldwide
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:12.860]   translation community in a movement to finish the task, to ensure that everyone on earth
[00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:19.860]   has access to Jesus Christ's gospel in a format they can understand.
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:27.180]   The goal is to see the Word of God recorded and freely provided in every language that
[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:33.020]   needs it by the year 2033.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.340]   My friends, this is it.
[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.380]   The final sprint.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:47.380]   The great commission fulfilled in our generation.
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.220]   Hear the words of Jesus.
[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.300]   These are not my words, Matthew 24, 14.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:58.580]   And the gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.580]   to all nations.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:05.620]   Now that word nations actually in Greek is ethnos, which actually means ethnic groups.
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:11.720]   It means the geographical countries that we see today will be as a testimony to all people
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.540]   groups and then the end will come.
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:19.740]   Jesus will come again.
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:25.580]   I hope I've got you excited about our journey.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:31.500]   But you may be asking, how are we going to start?
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:37.540]   Well from Ash Wednesday, this Wednesday, the 22nd of February until Easter Sunday, the
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:48.580]   9th of April, we will be joining Christians across the globe, listening to Luke's gospel.
[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:54.340]   To do so, you'll need to download the free app that Johnny mentioned, One Hearing the
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:57.220]   Word.
[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:02.740]   Every day you'll be able to listen to a passage from Luke's gospel.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.420]   It will only be a few minutes.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:10.900]   There'll be a daily devotional that's been written by a pastor here in Hong Kong.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:16.180]   And there will be a prayer actually that I wrote.
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:22.100]   Then each weekend we'll have the opportunity to watch a gospel film.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:31.540]   And here at church, we will be listening to a sermon based on the parables of Jesus in
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.380]   Luke.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.740]   This is what you can look forward to.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.700]   I've put it up there now.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.820]   So if you want to know what we're going to be hearing and who you're going to be hearing
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:48.260]   it from the next few weeks, these are the sermons for the next eight weeks.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:54.900]   And next week, Johnny will be bringing us the parable of the Good Samaritan.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:03.380]   And you've heard that this year we are introducing One Pray for Five with a vision that every
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:09.820]   person in the world will be prayed for by 2033.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:17.300]   And how it starts is you and I writing down the names today of five people, pre-believers
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.700]   that you are going to pray for.
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:25.980]   And we believe the power of mathematics is that that happens for the whole world will
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:29.940]   be covered in prayer in 10 years.
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:39.260]   Let me just take a few moments to give you some background to the parables of Jesus.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:47.460]   Jesus told parables to help his audience imagine a reality other than the one they were used
[00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:55.980]   to and to respond to it by having a change of heart and seeking a closer relationship
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.060]   with God.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:05.360]   That reality is what we call the kingdom of heaven.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.980]   The gospel of Luke contains both the largest total number of parables.
[00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:15.180]   There are 24 parables in the gospel of Luke.
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:20.980]   And there are 18 parables in Luke's gospel which are unique to Luke's gospel.
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.320]   They are not found in the other three gospels.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:33.440]   It is helpful for us to see how parables function in Luke's gospel.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:38.580]   But before we do that, let's take a step backwards.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:46.020]   What kind of speech is meant when we use the term parable?
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:56.780]   A parable is a short story that refers to something outside the parable itself.
[00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:05.180]   Jesus' parables, especially in the gospel of Luke, refer to the kingdom of God.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:11.460]   The English term parable comes from a Greek term, parabolē, but the Greek term has a
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:21.380]   somewhat broader range of meaning and includes, for example, what we often call riddles.
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:29.620]   Although parables are related to other kinds of speech like riddles and proverbs, parables
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.980]   emphasize story.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:39.040]   You're going to be hearing seven stories over the next seven weeks.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:47.960]   Parables are short stories that refer to God's realm of power, God's kingdom.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:53.500]   In Luke's gospel, as well as the gospels of Matthew and Mark, Jesus' parables generally
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.840]   have a very familiar setting.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:05.020]   But these little stories also usually have some surprising element that turns the familiar
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.460]   world upside down.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:18.600]   During Jesus' time on earth, he loved using profound parables to teach important lessons.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:29.440]   There's currently a modern day parable circling across the internet in which a wealthy father
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:36.320]   takes his son to a poor farm in the country with the intention of teaching his son to
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.580]   value their wealth.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:48.080]   But to his surprise, his son's eye-opening response to this exercise turns the tables
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.820]   completely.
[00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.560]   It goes like this.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:25:01.600]   One day, a very wealthy father took his son on a trip to the country for the sole purpose
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:07.000]   of showing his son how it was to be poor.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:15.760]   They spent a few days and nights on a farm of what would be considered a very poor family.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:21.040]   After their return from the trip, the father asked his son how he liked the trip.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.200]   It was great, dad.
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.280]   The son replied, did you see how poor people can be?
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.640]   Oh, yes, said the son.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.400]   So what did you learn from the trip?
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.040]   Asked the father.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:46.600]   The son said, I saw that we have one dog and they have four.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:53.480]   We have a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they have a creek that has
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.720]   no end.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:03.880]   We have imported lanterns in our garden, probably from Ikea, and they have stars at night.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:12.400]   Our patio reaches to the front yard and they have the whole horizon.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:22.180]   We have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our sight.
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:29.960]   We have servants who serve us, but they serve others.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:35.280]   We buy our food, but they grow theirs.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:44.040]   We have walls around our property to protect us, but they have friends to protect them.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.720]   The boy's father was speechless.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:59.700]   And his son said to him, dad, it showed me how poor we really are.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.000]   Very poignant.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:12.260]   In that same frame of mind, we are going to be looking together at the good Samaritan.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:20.620]   The rich fool, the unjust steward, the rich man and Lazarus, the Pharisee and the tax
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.580]   collector and the tenants.
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:29.860]   We could equally have looked at some other parables in Luke.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:35.420]   But we need to ask ourselves the question as we prepare for it.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:44.620]   What do the parables teach us about living in the kingdom of heaven?
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:51.740]   And perhaps more importantly, and week by week, I want you to ask yourself these questions.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:28:04.700]   What sort of changes do you or do we personally need to make in order to live in God's reign?
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:10.200]   Jesus told parables.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.540]   He didn't write them down to be read.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:25.080]   His message spread by word of mouth when his disciples told the stories.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:34.300]   I want to pray right now as we finish that we would offer our mouth.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:48.860]   We offer our mouth to the Lord to be used to take his message to the ends of the earth.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.340]   Would we stand as the band comes back?
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:56.340]   I'd love to pray for us.
[00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:18.820]   I'm going to ask you a question as we close tonight.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:31.180]   Are you willing to dedicate your mouth to be used as God would deign to use you to tell
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:40.780]   the stories of Jesus and his kingdom to the ends of the earth?
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:45.580]   I believe this is not about a preacher or a church.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.620]   It's about the mobilization.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:52.500]   There are going to be hundreds of thousands of Christians on this journey with us over
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:30:01.420]   Lent if each one of us would dedicate our mouth to him to be used.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:04.140]   We're going to be singing together in a moment.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:10.780]   Let it be today we sing a song of heaven.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.620]   Glory to our God.
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:18.780]   Let's pray.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:22.900]   Maybe you want to put your hands on your mouth.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:32.020]   Say Lord I offer you my lips.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.380]   We thank you Lord.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:39.740]   You've given us this vision.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:50.420]   The gospel will go to the ends of the earth.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.460]   Maybe you're not be like that father who took his son to the country.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:31:01.420]   Be trapped by the things of the world and the values of the world.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:07.780]   Maybe you'd be like that little boy.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:16.420]   Maybe we see the kingdom of God in the things that surround us.
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.580]   We pray today for the five people Lord that we're going to put the names down of and as
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.860]   we pray for them daily Lord.
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.760]   We pray for salvation.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:35.180]   We pray for restoration.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:41.180]   I want to pray for the churches of Hong Kong.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.220]   We pray for every church in this city Lord.
[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:51.020]   Pray for every pastor every leader.
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:56.260]   Help us Lord to see them as brothers and sisters.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:01.260]   Help us Lord to join hands with them.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.460]   Because there will be a day Lord.
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:09.700]   When we stand together before the throne of God.
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.580]   Arm in arm.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:18.540]   We sing this song of heaven.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:23.420]   Glory to our God who sits on the throne.
[00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.260]   Holy is the lamb.
[00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.500]   Let's not wait Lord till we're in heaven.
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:36.220]   Let's link arms together.
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.500]   Let's join together.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:46.420]   Give us one heart one mind and one voice.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:51.580]   As we say glory to God.
[00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.260]   In Jesus name.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.260]   Amen.
[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.260]   Let's sing this song together.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.600]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
