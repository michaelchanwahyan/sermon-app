1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,120
 I'm excited about tonight.

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,600
 I get excited to teach.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:20,140
 I've been preaching for, gosh, probably 35 years, but I get so excited every time because

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,560
 I think anything could happen tonight.

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,960
 Like literally anything.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,680
 I really believe when I talk to God, when I pray, like He literally hears me.

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,880
 The God who spoke the world into existence hears me.

8
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,440
 And so tonight I was praying specifically saying, "God, can I please experience you?

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,780
 Can we all experience you?"

10
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:59,560
 And so as we go through His Word tonight, I'm just excited about what He might do.

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:06,320
 I've been in Hong Kong for eight months now, and it's been one of the best seasons of our

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,660
 lives.

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,720
 We love it here.

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,520
 I don't know, every season is so happy for me.

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,680
 I love following God.

16
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,480
 I love experiencing Him in new ways.

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:29,700
 In fact, my wife who's with me, we've been married for 27 years now.

18
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,840
 We have seven children, two grandchildren.

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,640
 And when we decided to move here from the US, we thought, "Okay, we'll take our four

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,020
 youngest children and move to Hong Kong."

21
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:55,560
 And then both of my son-in-laws prayed and sought the Lord, and they both said, "We believe

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,100
 God wants us to come with you."

23
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,920
 And so 12 of us moved to Hong Kong.

24
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,640
 Yeah.

25
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:14,280
 The 12 of us moved to Hong Kong in February, like in the middle of COVID and the protests,

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,720
 and everyone in America thought we were crazy.

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,560
 They go, "Why would you do that to your children?"

28
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,760
 And then we get here, and it's totally safe in Hong Kong, and it's crazy in America right

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
 now.

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,040
 Especially today, they're going to be killing each other.

31
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,480
 I mean, it's just a way we've experienced God over the years.

32
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:50,880
 I remember at our 25-year anniversary, at dinner I asked my wife, I said, "No, she asked

33
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,520
 me."

34
00:02:52,520 --> 00:03:02,840
 She said, "Do you know of anyone on the earth that is happier than us?"

35
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,480
 And I said, "I don't.

36
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
 I don't know anyone."

37
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
 And she goes, "I know."

38
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,840
 She goes, "I keep thinking there has to be someone on the earth that is more blessed

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,200
 than we are."

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
 But she goes, "I haven't met them yet."

41
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,920
 And I go, "That's exactly the way I think."

42
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,800
 It's so cool at 25 years of marriage to go, "I wouldn't trade this for anything."

43
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,280
 It's been an amazing life.

44
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,720
 The way that we've seen God answer prayer.

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,800
 There's no way our lives should have worked out this way.

46
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,520
 So many times I'm just amazed, going, "God, you really heard me yesterday when I prayed

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,760
 that specifically."

48
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,260
 I mean, sometimes I am literally shaking, like so shocked at the way that He answers

49
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,100
 my prayers.

50
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,760
 And so when I was praying for you today, I'm saying, "God, can I experience it again?

51
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,580
 Can you do something tonight?

52
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,160
 Something that I've never even experienced?

53
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,920
 Can we all experience you in some way?

54
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,560
 Can that fire come from heaven in some way to where some of you that maybe you've been

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,040
 going to church services your whole life for the first time, you're like, "I get it.

56
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,800
 I love Him."

57
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:41,960
 Because something I've noticed being in Hong Kong, the people here are so hardworking.

58
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,640
 They work so many hours and it's great.

59
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,080
 I mean, when I need something done, this is the place to go.

60
00:04:53,080 --> 00:05:01,320
 Hong Kong people know how to get things done and how to work.

61
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:11,560
 But sometimes the relationships aren't so strong between parents and children, husbands

62
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,720
 and wives.

63
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:21,200
 And I've seen how sometimes that spills into the church, where you can be very good at

64
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,560
 obeying commands and even showing up to serve.

65
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,240
 You know, if we need people to pass out rice, you'll show up.

66
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,400
 If we need people to fold bulletins or do whatever all night, you'll show up, you'll

67
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,880
 do it.

68
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,240
 And you'll come week after week.

69
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,680
 But how is the relationship?

70
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,780
 Because I grew up in a Chinese Baptist church, you know?

71
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,000
 And so very, very similar.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,360
 Both of my parents were pastors in Hong Kong, both in the Baptist church.

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:15,520
 And so when they went to the US, the idea was to start a church very similar to the

74
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,640
 Hong Kong church.

75
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,000
 And so that's what I grew up in.

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,640
 And so grateful, so thankful for some of the people in that church.

77
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:32,480
 In fact, Simo, the pastor's wife, she still calls me.

78
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,680
 This is 45 years later.

79
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,160
 Simo still calls me.

80
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,480
 In fact, she's like, "Don't move to Hong Kong."

81
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
 You know?

82
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
 She goes, "Ning li Zhong Min mai gei hou.

83
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
 Mou buan la.

84
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
 Gei hou da sei ni."

85
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,840
 You know, she's just worried, like, "Don't go over there.

86
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
 Your Chinese is terrible.

87
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
 You're going to say the wrong thing and someone's going to beat you up."

88
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
 You know?

89
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,720
 She goes, "Ning li Zhong Min mai gei hou.

90
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,720
 Mou buan la.

91
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
 Gei hou da sei ni."

92
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
 You know?

93
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
 And she goes, "I can't help it."

94
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
 She goes, "I've been loving you for 40 years.

95
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,600
 I can't just stop."

96
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,680
 And I think, "Wow, that's so beautiful.

97
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,440
 So much that I'm thankful for."

98
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,200
 You know, but I saw so many of my friends that grew up in the same church and so many

99
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:25,360
 people that were in that same church and they're not following God anymore.

100
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,080
 And they were very good at doing whatever the pastor told them to do and obey those

101
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,080
 rules.

102
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,920
 But it's like it really wasn't in their own hearts.

103
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,620
 They didn't really experience Him.

104
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,560
 They know how to do Christian things, but did they really know God?

105
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,480
 See, when I grew up, I didn't understand some of this book.

106
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:02,120
 When I would read like, you know, the passages about God's holiness, I understood it.

107
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,040
 And when I would read the commands, I understood them.

108
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:15,160
 But then when I would read the Psalms, the Psalms were very confusing to me because I

109
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,900
 would read the way that David would talk to God and I go, "Wow, that's weird."

110
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:30,480
 Because for most of us growing up in a Chinese home, the relationship, especially with your

111
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,680
 father, you don't talk.

112
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,400
 You just don't talk, right?

113
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:45,000
 I never, not even one time, had a conversation with, not one sentence of a conversation with

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,180
 my father.

115
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,360
 I obeyed him.

116
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,440
 I got the grades he told me to get because if I didn't get those grades, he would punish

117
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,600
 me severely.

118
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,920
 I feared him.

119
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,600
 I would try to honor him, but there's no relationship.

120
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,040
 So then I read the Psalms and it talks about David going, "Oh, I just want you.

121
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,600
 I just want to be with you.

122
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,080
 This is the one thing I ask.

123
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,560
 Can I just stare at you?

124
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,660
 Oh, when can I, even when I'm in the desert and there's no water, all I want is you."

125
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:30,880
 And I would read those things and I just couldn't understand it because I grew up very Chinese.

126
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:41,960
 And we understand commands and we will obey those commands, but these words about relationship

127
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:51,560
 and desire, especially with your authority, okay, your authority, and David's talking

128
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,440
 to God like he's his friend or his wife.

129
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,360
 It's like these words, how can you use that for authority?

130
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:11,320
 Because authority and intimacy don't seem to go together.

131
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:19,440
 But I would read that in the Bible and God over many, many, many years, even to this

132
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:32,000
 day, he's teaching me about love, teaching me about relationship, teaching me the enjoyment.

133
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,760
 And it's not just David.

134
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,240
 In the New Testament, you know, one of my favorite passages is in Philippians 1 when

135
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:50,280
 Paul says in verse 21, "For me to live is Christ and to die is gain."

136
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,880
 He's like, "My whole life is about Jesus.

137
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,120
 And if I die, that'd be even better because I'd be even closer to him.

138
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,240
 I could see him.

139
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,360
 I want to be with him."

140
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:09,940
 Because a couple of verses later, he says, he goes, "I am hard-pressed between the two.

141
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:19,760
 My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better."

142
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,360
 Paul goes, "Oh, I just want to leave this earth right now.

143
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,920
 This would be so much better."

144
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,580
 Is that your desire tonight?

145
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,240
 Not because you're depressed, not because, you know, you're having a hard time, but because

146
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,320
 you're in love with the person of Jesus.

147
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,320
 Is it like a real...is he a real person to you?

148
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,880
 You know, it's like when...you know, I'm so grateful for COVID because all the places

149
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,680
 I was supposed to travel, I got to say, "Sorry, you know, I can't go.

150
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,400
 I have to stay here."

151
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,220
 But it's great because I don't want to go anywhere.

152
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,480
 And every time I'm away from the family, I just travel every single week.

153
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,640
 And so every time I'm like, "Oh, I hate being away from my family.

154
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,500
 And I can't wait to get home."

155
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,640
 That's the way Paul felt about Jesus.

156
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,300
 He wasn't just this idea of some being up there.

157
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,300
 He was a real person.

158
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,500
 He's going, "God, this isn't enough.

159
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,820
 I love praying to you, but I want to see you.

160
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,380
 I want to be with you.

161
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,100
 You're the only one I want to be with.

162
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,420
 So I would much rather leave the earth, all these people on the earth I love, for my one

163
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,220
 true love, for me to live is Christ."

164
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,980
 And I was thinking, "You know, I can explain this passage to you.

165
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,900
 I can teach it."

166
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:07,960
 But I'm saying, "God, I don't want this just to be a lesson."

167
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:20,080
 So I brought with me a menu of just different...it's a pastry shop, you know, different cakes.

168
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,540
 And I can teach you the menu.

169
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:28,460
 I say, "Oh, you got to try this cake.

170
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,700
 Wow.

171
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,860
 It's like...I don't know what's on there, okay?

172
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,900
 But I...because I can't read Chinese.

173
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,980
 But if I could, I could just read it for you and say, "Oh, this cake is made of this and

174
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,500
 this and this and this."

175
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,420
 You know, and you'll be there and go, "Wow, that sounds really good."

176
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,460
 Then I go, "Okay, you got to try this one, okay?

177
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,460
 This one is..."

178
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,780
 You know, and I explain every...

179
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,940
 Maybe I can explain it so well.

180
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,420
 See, this happens in a lot of churches.

181
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,900
 We open up the menu and we just start reading.

182
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,380
 And everyone's like, "Oh, that sounds good.

183
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,900
 That sounds really good.

184
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:21,060
 And maybe I've never tasted this, but I can still explain it to you.

185
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,220
 I can still be right.

186
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,780
 I can still be accurate."

187
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,380
 I say, "Wow, they have these egg tarts."

188
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:33,660
 You know, and I say, "Wow, look at this, you know, how they make them."

189
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,820
 And I can explain everything in an egg tart, how it's created, what it would taste like.

190
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,100
 And you go, "Oh, that's good.

191
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,100
 That's good.

192
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
 Thank you.

193
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,100
 Thank you.

194
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,460
 Next week, teach me about, you know, char siu bao.

195
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,380
 You know, just teach me something else.

196
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,380
 Oh, okay, that's good."

197
00:14:50,380 --> 00:15:00,420
 And we learn and we pass on information and it's accurate.

198
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,060
 But my prayer, I actually brought some Dan Tat, okay?

199
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:12,460
 Now or I could go, "Wow, this is so good.

200
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,860
 This is so awesome.

201
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
 Here, see how that...

202
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,860
 You want to try one?

203
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,700
 You want to try one?"

204
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,700
 This is what I prayed for.

205
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,020
 I go, "God, I don't want to just talk about you.

206
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,820
 I want to be up here.

207
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,540
 I want to experience you.

208
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,620
 I want to taste you."

209
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,860
 The Bible says, "Taste and see that the Lord is good."

210
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,940
 I always pray, "God, make me one of those pastors that's talking about you as I'm tasting

211
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,940
 you."

212
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,220
 You know, that I'm not just reading out a book.

213
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,660
 That's fine.

214
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,820
 It's accurate.

215
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,300
 But I want it in my mouth.

216
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,940
 I want to taste it.

217
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,740
 And I want you to taste it.

218
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:08,500
 I'm saying, "God, I can't make this happen.

219
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:19,060
 I can't make you experience God and understand this relationship where it's real to you and

220
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,100
 He enters you and He becomes a part of you."

221
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,300
 And then you tell everyone.

222
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,460
 Then you've tasted and you tell everyone, "You've got to understand this relationship."

223
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,980
 Man, for me to live is Christ.

224
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,100
 I love Him so much.

225
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,540
 I just want to leave the earth right now because I can't get enough of Him.

226
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,020
 That was Paul.

227
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:53,660
 And I can explain to you how Paul felt, but that's not my desire.

228
00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:00,180
 I go, "God, I want them to feel what Paul felt.

229
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,460
 I want them to experience what Paul experienced.

230
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:09,980
 I want you to taste and see and go, 'I really want to leave the earth right now because

231
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:18,380
 I'm so at peace with Jesus and I want more of Him.'"

232
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:28,380
 See I believe there are some of you here that all you've done is read the menu and you just

233
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,060
 look at it, the pictures, you go, "Yeah, I agree.

234
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,060
 I agree.

235
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
 I agree.

236
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,060
 I agree.

237
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
 That sounds good.

238
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,820
 Oh, good.

239
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,020
 I can have peace beyond comprehension?

240
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,540
 I can have that much peace?

241
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,780
 I'd like to try that someday.

242
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:53,220
 I could have joy, joy that's inexpressible where there's no words, where I'm so freaked

243
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,500
 out, like happy that I can't...

244
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,540
 There's no words to explain how good this is."

245
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:02,260
 You go, "Oh, I want to try that."

246
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,660
 It's all these things you read about.

247
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:13,220
 And maybe you've been reading the menu your whole life, but you've never tasted.

248
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:20,820
 I'm saying, "God, I can't make that happen.

249
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,100
 I can't make a blind person see.

250
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,100
 You have to do it.

251
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:31,740
 It has to be a miracle."

252
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,460
 You know, this week they asked me a couple of months ago to come because they want to

253
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:45,060
 talk about giving to the poor and caring for the needy.

254
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:50,780
 And so, yeah, that's such a big concern of mine is those who are suffering.

255
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,580
 And so I'm like, "Yeah, I'm honored to do that."

256
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,620
 But I know how Chinese can be.

257
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,900
 You know, we ask you to do something and you do it.

258
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,900
 It's weird.

259
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,420
 It's not like that in America, okay?

260
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,500
 So if we say, "Give to the poor," you're like, "Okay," you know, and you do it.

261
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:23,180
 But I think we're far more concerned about the heart behind it.

262
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,940
 There's a passage I want to show you.

263
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,500
 It's in 2 Corinthians.

264
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,660
 I love this.

265
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:38,220
 I was looking at it again this morning just going, "Wow, it really says this."

266
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:47,420
 In 2 Corinthians 8, Paul says this, "We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of

267
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:54,660
 God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia.

268
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:05,580
 For in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty

269
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,340
 have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.

270
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,500
 For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means of their

271
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:24,100
 own accord, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints."

272
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
 Okay.

273
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:33,700
 He says, "I want to tell you," he tells them about the churches in Macedonia, and he says,

274
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,340
 "They are extremely poor."

275
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,260
 He says, "I want to tell you about this church.

276
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,420
 They're extremely poor.

277
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:51,020
 But they earnestly, they kept begging me, 'Can we give our money to the saints who really

278
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
 need it?'"

279
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,860
 It's like, "What?"

280
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:00,500
 These guys were very, extremely poor.

281
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
 Extremely poor.

282
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:08,580
 Picture the poorest people you've ever seen, and imagine them begging, "Can we give you

283
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:14,900
 what we have to other people who are in need?"

284
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:22,340
 But what I want to point out to you is Paul is not telling the Corinthians about the Macedonian

285
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,340
 church.

286
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,620
 He is not bragging about the Macedonian church.

287
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,540
 He is not saying, "That church, those churches are so amazing in Macedonia."

288
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,660
 No.

289
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,060
 What does he say?

290
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:44,740
 He says, "We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among

291
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,660
 the churches."

292
00:21:49,660 --> 00:22:00,300
 He's writing, telling the Corinthians, "I want to tell you, God gave a gift to the Macedonians.

293
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,300
 I want to tell you."

294
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,460
 Because grace is, right?

295
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,700
 He gives you something you don't deserve.

296
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:11,980
 He goes, "I've got to tell you something that God gave."

297
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,540
 When someone receives a gift, do we ever boast about that?

298
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:25,660
 You know, let's suppose, let's pretend Pastor John is rich.

299
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,580
 Okay, use your imagination.

300
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,620
 Say financially rich.

301
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,220
 Okay, pretend he's financially rich.

302
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:47,700
 Say he has billions of dollars and tonight then he hands Pastor Michelle $1 billion.

303
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,780
 Here you go, $1 billion.

304
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,340
 Would any of us say, "Wow, Michelle is so awesome"?

305
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,100
 No.

306
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,180
 We'd go, "You're so lucky.

307
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,660
 Why did you get it?

308
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,180
 How could you be so blessed?

309
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,780
 How could you be so fortunate?"

310
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,180
 We'd all look at the giver and go, "You seriously gave her that?"

311
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,740
 So that's what Paul is saying here in 2 Corinthians 8.

312
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:23,220
 He goes, "I want to tell you what God gave the Macedonian churches, the grace.

313
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:31,420
 He made them so generous that even in their poverty, they're like, 'Can I give?

314
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
 Can I give?'"

315
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:38,900
 See, Paul is explaining this is a gift from God.

316
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,580
 Generosity is, if you're a generous person and I don't know you, I don't know who's stingy.

317
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:51,420
 I mean, most Chinese are cheap, you know, but there may be some of you that are so generous

318
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:58,980
 givers and that's nothing to be proud of.

319
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,580
 That's what I love about this passage.

320
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,340
 That was a gift that was given to you.

321
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,380
 Why are you so generous?

322
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,580
 Because God gave you His grace.

323
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,540
 And so that's why it's not like, "Oh, please give.

324
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,940
 Give to the poor, this or that."

325
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:20,780
 My prayer is, "God, would you give a gift to Gong Fu Church tonight?"

326
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,380
 Can you...

327
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,860
 The way you just gave generosity to the Macedonians where they were in extreme poverty and yet

328
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:36,040
 they became givers, that was a gift.

329
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:43,980
 And there's probably people here that do have a lot of money and you're scared and you're

330
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,060
 holding on to it.

331
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,500
 And you're like, "Well, I don't know if I have enough to retire.

332
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,900
 I don't know if I have enough for my kids to retire.

333
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,420
 I don't know if my grandkids will have any."

334
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,660
 And you have so much and you're still worried.

335
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,660
 And so you know people are dying today, but you're scared.

336
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,860
 And we're not going, "Please, please, just give and beg you."

337
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,100
 We're saying, "God, would you pour out your grace on them?

338
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,860
 Would you gift them with generosity?"

339
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:25,440
 Because Jesus says it's more blessed to be a giver than a receiver, right?

340
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,140
 It's more blessed.

341
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,380
 I mean, try to think.

342
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,260
 Do you know of any generous person?

343
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:38,260
 Think of the most generous people you know.

344
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,420
 Do you know of any generous people who are unhappy?

345
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,060
 My wife and I were talking about that.

346
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:51,260
 Try to think about someone who's just a total giver and just mad all the time.

347
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,260
 It's not.

348
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,820
 The generous people are the happiest people on earth.

349
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,620
 It's those who are holding on and have so much, but they're scared.

350
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:10,220
 There's no joy versus, "Oh, I freely give and God always takes care of me."

351
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:16,540
 I look back at my life and I go, "God, I don't know where I'd be without giving.

352
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:25,980
 Some of my greatest boasts are the way you came through when we gave."

353
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,940
 I remember the first time I went to Africa.

354
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:37,200
 It was about over 20 years ago.

355
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,100
 I kind of went for selfish reasons.

356
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,380
 There were some famous people going on the trip.

357
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:54,300
 In fact, there was one of my favorite bands back then was a band named U2.

358
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,060
 Bono was supposed to be on this trip.

359
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,420
 I thought, "Whoa, I want to go to Africa with Bono.

360
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,460
 That'd be cool."

361
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,580
 A few others, Franklin Graham, but he's not as cool.

362
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,060
 A few others, but I'm thinking, "Wow, this would be really cool."

363
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,980
 But then Franklin Graham's mother got sick and so he didn't go.

364
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,340
 And then all the famous people didn't go.

365
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:24,500
 I'm on a plane going, "Wow, it's just me and a few no-name pastors."

366
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:37,620
 But when I got there and I saw the poverty of these people, everything in me just wanted

367
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,780
 to help them.

368
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,700
 And I just fell in love with these little kids.

369
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,660
 And gosh, they have nothing.

370
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:52,900
 And I'm seeing these little girls trying to find food in the dump, just lifting things

371
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,940
 up, looking for anything they can eat.

372
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,540
 And I'm thinking, "I have two little girls at home."

373
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,260
 I only had two back then.

374
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,540
 And I'm going, "Whoa, what if that was them?

375
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:06,380
 I'm supposed to love them like I would love my own kids."

376
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,740
 And suddenly, I just had this love.

377
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,140
 And I was like everyone else.

378
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,740
 Yeah, this is a picture of me.

379
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:22,420
 This was during our trip to Ethiopia on our 20-year anniversary.

380
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,700
 So just like seven years ago, we're like, "Gosh, all our greatest times are when we

381
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,580
 go out and serve."

382
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,700
 And so we go, "Okay, I haven't been to Ethiopia yet and we've been volunteering there, serving

383
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
 there."

384
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:42,020
 And this girl, I mean, I've never seen anyone like that, that bad.

385
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,420
 I've seen a lot of poverty, but not like that.

386
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,780
 And I remember just, I didn't know if I could touch her.

387
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,580
 I didn't know, you know, when I asked the leader, I go, you know, and her stomach was

388
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,580
 distended.

389
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,700
 That means like her organs were already eating themselves.

390
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,140
 And he just said, "She's not going to live no matter what we do."

391
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,940
 I said, "But can I pray for her?"

392
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,820
 He goes, "Oh, yeah, you can pray for her."

393
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,820
 And I just begged God.

394
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,500
 I said, "Oh, God, can you save her?

395
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:17,160
 Just keep her alive long enough to worship you."

396
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,620
 And there were thousands of kids like this.

397
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:25,100
 Just you know, her brothers, sisters, they're all dead.

398
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,100
 It's just weird.

399
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:32,020
 I've been on trips where I just watched mothers screaming like crazy because their child just

400
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,580
 died.

401
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,620
 But I think I sent the next picture too.

402
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,700
 You can go to the next slide.

403
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,900
 That's her, the same girl a few years ago.

404
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:55,020
 And I can't tell you the thrill of going, you know, that day we were chasing each other

405
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,020
 around.

406
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,980
 We were playing tag and she's just laughing, laughing, laughing.

407
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:05,020
 Then we have a worship service and I just see her with her hands up in the air worshiping

408
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,020
 Jesus.

409
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,140
 I go, "God, that's the one thing I prayed for.

410
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,620
 Have her live so she could be used to worship you."

411
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,140
 There's no way I can explain to you.

412
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:25,180
 I mean, I'm trying to explain it to you, but I can't have you taste what it's like to chase

413
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:32,300
 a girl like that around and play tag with her and listen to her laugh and know that

414
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:38,060
 had we not gone on that trip, she would have died.

415
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:40,100
 And she should have died.

416
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,580
 And there's thousands more and sometimes we get there too late.

417
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,700
 But it's the joy.

418
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,420
 It's the joy.

419
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:51,420
 It doesn't compare.

420
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,020
 You know, when I came home from Africa the first time, I told my wife, I go, "You don't

421
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,020
 understand.

422
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,140
 These kids, they make me so happy."

423
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,100
 It's not like I feel guilty.

424
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,500
 I go, "I just, I want to give whatever we can."

425
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,940
 And we didn't have very much, but we had a house.

426
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,300
 And I was like, "Do you mind if we sell our house?

427
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,620
 You know, we can just move into a trailer or something like that."

428
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,420
 I said, "Because these kids, I have to do something for them.

429
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,700
 I want to do something for them."

430
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,380
 And my wife, you know, at that time I think she was maybe pregnant with our third or we

431
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,060
 had at least two.

432
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:37,860
 And she goes, "Well, it's not, I didn't go with you on the trip.

433
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,740
 So I don't feel what you're feeling.

434
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,700
 But if you think God wants us to sell our house, then let's do it."

435
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:53,180
 And so that day we went out looking for trailer parks and trailers to live in and sold our

436
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,540
 home and found a smaller place to live in.

437
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:04,300
 And the joy of being able to help these people.

438
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:12,340
 And then I remember, gosh, probably 12, 13 years ago, you know, we kept giving and seeing

439
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,700
 the results and we kept getting happier.

440
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:22,580
 I remember one time after a service, I'm going, "God, there's so many rich people in our church."

441
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:30,380
 I go, "But if they really believed in heaven, why wouldn't they be giving it all away?

442
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,020
 Because you say this is forever.

443
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:39,380
 And everything I give you, you're going to reward me for a hundredfold forever.

444
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,380
 That's a good investment."

445
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,620
 Okay?

446
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,500
 And so I go, "If they believe that, why won't they give more?

447
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,020
 Why do they have to live so luxuriously?

448
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,900
 Why can't they just live like a normal person and give the rest of the money if they believe

449
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,140
 in heaven?"

450
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:03,780
 And in my prayer, I go, "God," at the end, I said, "God, either change him," I said,

451
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,260
 "or you can make me rich."

452
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,980
 Seriously, this was my prayer.

453
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,900
 And I told God, "If you make me rich, I will still live the same way.

454
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,660
 I won't spend any of it.

455
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:25,980
 I'll give it all away because I am so happy knowing you that money won't change me.

456
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,100
 Money can't make me happier."

457
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:35,460
 And I just kind of said that like I wasn't that serious to say, "Change them or make

458
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,780
 me rich and I'll give it all away and show the world that it doesn't matter."

459
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,340
 And the next year, I made a million dollars.

460
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:52,180
 US, not just a little Hong Kong million, like US million.

461
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,900
 And I'm going, "What?"

462
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,340
 Because I wrote a book I didn't know I could write.

463
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,780
 My English was terrible.

464
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:06,940
 My math was awesome, but my Chinese, you know, but the English was horrible.

465
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,620
 And then I write a book and it becomes a bestseller.

466
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,540
 And I'm going, "What?"

467
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,180
 And they go, "Yeah, you'll have...

468
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:19,180
 Looks like you'll have millions of dollars coming in."

469
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:25,260
 And I told my wife, I'm like, "We're not touching any of it."

470
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,660
 I told God, "If you made me rich, I don't want it.

471
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,500
 I'll give it all away."

472
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,020
 And immediately, we signed over all the royalties, you know, to a nonprofit and just saying,

473
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:44,140
 you know, we spend the last, I don't know, 10 years or so just giving away millions of

474
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,700
 dollars around the world.

475
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,820
 And that's why I feel like we're the happiest people in the world.

476
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,460
 And we still drove the same old car, same old clothes.

477
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,780
 I mean, this is the only...

478
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,460
 This is the only time I've ever preached in a suit, you know, like, because I heard that's

479
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:06,820
 what you do.

480
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,820
 And I just bought this.

481
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,620
 I had the same suit for 20 years.

482
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,620
 And then my second, third daughter just got married.

483
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,220
 So we bought this for $100.

484
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:24,500
 But before the suit, I just wore the same old clothes because it's like, it doesn't

485
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,780
 matter.

486
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:34,020
 For me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

487
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,020
 This is why...

488
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,100
 How much time do I have?

489
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,100
 I'm okay?

490
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,500
 Okay, I'll tell one more story.

491
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,260
 Okay, all right.

492
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:53,380
 Like when I read in the book of Luke, in the book of Luke, Jesus is talking to rich people.

493
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:59,020
 In Luke 18, you remember the story of the rich young ruler?

494
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:07,260
 And the rich young ruler comes to Jesus and he says, "What do I have to do to go to heaven?"

495
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,860
 And Jesus answered him in a way that we wouldn't.

496
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,860
 He says, "Well, have you obeyed the commands?"

497
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,500
 And the guy's like, "Yeah, yeah, I obeyed them."

498
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,100
 And then Jesus says something crazy.

499
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:25,060
 I mean, this man is just asking, "How do I go to heaven?"

500
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:33,100
 And Jesus, "Sell everything you have and give it to the poor."

501
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:41,180
 And the man, it says, he walked away sad because he had so much.

502
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:50,100
 See that's the way some people respond when we ask them to give to those who are in need.

503
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:57,100
 They almost get sad, like, "Ugh, give to the poor."

504
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,420
 And for this man, it was everything.

505
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:07,220
 And the Son of God asked him to do it and he was sad because he felt like someone's

506
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:14,380
 taking away something I love.

507
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:20,740
 But then in the very next chapter, after Jesus says, "Oh, it's so hard for the rich to enter

508
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,580
 the kingdom of heaven.

509
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:27,300
 It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter

510
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,060
 the gates of heaven."

511
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:36,100
 But then in the next chapter, in the next chapter, there's a man named Zacchaeus.

512
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:45,580
 And the Bible specifically says in Luke 19, in verse 2, "There was a man named Zacchaeus.

513
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:51,900
 He was a chief tax collector and was rich."

514
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,740
 And he was seeking to see who Jesus was, but on account of the crowd, he couldn't because

515
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,740
 he was small.

516
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:02,980
 So he ran on ahead, climbed up a sycamore tree.

517
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,540
 And then, you know, Jesus sees him and says, "Get down, I want to come to your house."

518
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,860
 And you know the story, Zacchaeus is like, "What?

519
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,860
 Jesus?

520
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,220
 Jesus is going to come to my house?"

521
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:18,460
 He gets so excited.

522
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:24,280
 So he came down and received him joyfully.

523
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:32,120
 And then in verse 8, "Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, 'Behold, Lord, half of my

524
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,120
 goods I give to the poor.

525
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:41,980
 And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold.'

526
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:47,100
 And Jesus said to him, 'Today salvation has come to this house.'"

527
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,100
 Remember, Jesus says it's hard for the rich.

528
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:58,660
 But then here it says he's a rich man and he goes, "Salvation has come to this house."

529
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,700
 What's crazy is you don't even have a record of Jesus saying, "Well, give to the poor."

530
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,900
 Zacchaeus just goes, "I can't believe you're in my house.

531
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,220
 You're in my house.

532
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,220
 The Son of God is in my house.

533
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:14,020
 Okay, everyone, half of everything I own goes to the poor.

534
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,020
 And I know I've stolen money from some of you.

535
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,580
 I'll give you four times as much back with the rest of my money."

536
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:25,620
 And Jesus just sees Zacchaeus and goes, "Salvation has come to this house."

537
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:30,180
 Do you see the difference in the attitude?

538
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,340
 One person is looking at his money going, "Oh, I don't know.

539
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,700
 I don't know.

540
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,060
 I don't know."

541
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,420
 You're asking for everything.

542
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,460
 I don't know.

543
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:46,340
 The other person, Zacchaeus is like, "Jesus, you're Jesus.

544
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,620
 You're the Son of God.

545
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,460
 You want to come into my house?

546
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,460
 Seriously?

547
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,860
 Oh my gosh, this is crazy.

548
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,700
 Here, take all my money.

549
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,980
 You guys, I know I stole from you.

550
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,980
 Here's the money."

551
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,420
 He's not thinking about his money.

552
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,220
 He's looking at Jesus and going, "I can't believe you're willing to come into my house."

553
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:15,620
 You see, when you really understand who Jesus is, when you've really tasted and you really

554
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:21,820
 go, "Wait, so Jesus, you went earth.

555
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,340
 And then the earth just showed up?"

556
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,420
 He's like, "Yeah, yeah, that's what I did."

557
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:31,460
 "Oh my gosh, and you're in my house.

558
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,060
 Like you seriously, what did you do?

559
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,060
 You just said light?"

560
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,100
 He goes, "Yeah, I just said light."

561
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,820
 And just, "That's it?"

562
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,580
 And then light, like the sun, "Well, how did it?"

563
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:46,180
 And now you're in my house.

564
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,700
 Of course I'm not thinking about my money.

565
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,140
 Of course I'm not thinking about retirement.

566
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:59,020
 You spoke the world into existence and now you're about to go to the cross and you're

567
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,620
 going to die for me?

568
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:07,540
 To pay for everything I've done wrong?

569
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,620
 Because you want me?

570
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:13,340
 Because Jesus, you want me?

571
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:16,580
 You want relationship?

572
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,780
 You want to know me?

573
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,620
 My own dad didn't want to know me.

574
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,860
 And you who spoke the world into existence, you're going to die on a cross because you

575
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:32,560
 want me?

576
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,060
 This is crazy.

577
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,420
 This is insane.

578
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:46,020
 That's why a few million dollars, you're talking about money?

579
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,620
 You think I care about money?

580
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:56,100
 Man, I go, "God, thank you.

581
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,100
 Thank you.

582
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,520
 You gave me a gift.

583
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,220
 You opened my eyes."

584
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,180
 And now money, nothing matters.

585
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,740
 You have it all.

586
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:18,940
 Because for me to live is Christ and to die is gain.

587
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:32,980
 And I'm praying that some of you would be honest enough to admit, "Wow, I feel more

588
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,860
 like the rich young ruler than I do Zacchaeus.

589
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,380
 I'm looking at all these things.

590
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:43,340
 I didn't have to give up to really follow Jesus and I still love them all.

591
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:48,500
 And I don't know if I'm ready to follow him.

592
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,260
 But I see Zacchaeus and now you're explaining who Jesus is?"

593
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:01,420
 And I'm going, "Wow, he really did that for me?"

594
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:08,340
 And maybe tonight he's going to open your eyes because I prayed that.

595
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:14,580
 For some of you, maybe you're like a lot of the people in the church I grew up with where

596
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:19,500
 you did things, you obeyed things.

597
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:26,740
 You didn't do anything super evil, you know, all the thou shall not command, you got them

598
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,740
 down.

599
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,040
 You stayed away from those things.

600
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:37,380
 But this joy of tasting God and going, "Oh, I love him.

601
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:41,000
 I just want to leave this earth and be with him.

602
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,240
 Jesus, please come because I miss you.

603
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,200
 I just want to be with you.

604
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,880
 I just want to hold you and experience you even more."

605
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,480
 That's what I'm praying for.

606
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:07,800
 In fact, even right now, I'm going to pray that God would give some of you the gift.

607
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,600
 I'm not asking you to give, okay?

608
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,160
 I'm going to ask God to give.

609
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:20,680
 I want him to give you sight like Zacchaeus.

610
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,920
 I want him to give you generosity like the Macedonians.

611
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:41,400
 Father, right now, I praise you.

612
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:58,280
 I worship you for opening up my eyes to how beautiful you are, for giving me generosity.

613
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:11,480
 God, I was just as selfish as anyone until you opened my eyes to what a treasure I have

614
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,040
 in Jesus.

615
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,280
 Money is ridiculous to me now, Lord.

616
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,680
 That's a gift from you.

617
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:38,200
 And I pray for my new friends in this room that you would pour your grace out on them,

618
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:49,880
 that they would see you even now as we worship you, that they would taste of you.

619
00:45:49,880 --> 00:46:15,560
 Holy Spirit, please fall on this room.

620
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,320
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

621
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:29,320
