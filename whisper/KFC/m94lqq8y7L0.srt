1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 (audience applauding)

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,520
 - Good evening.

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,860
 How is everybody doing?

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,700
 Can you believe it?

5
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,900
 2022 is almost over.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,160
 We can take a deep breath.

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,440
 Wow.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,020
 What a year it has been.

9
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,020
 What is one word you would use to describe 2022?

10
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,120
 What is one word you would use?

11
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,960
 What is one word?

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,100
 Okay, somebody said COVID.

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,400
 Okay, everybody shout out the word in one, two, three.

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,240
 Okay?

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,880
 One, two, three, shout out your word.

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,480
 - COVID.

17
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,880
 - Okay, I heard some great.

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,600
 I had some COVID, so I didn't hear anything else.

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,680
 But I would say that this year

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,240
 has been a year of uncertainty.

21
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,280
 Uncertainty.

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,520
 Yes, COVID has been mutating,

23
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,680
 and we had alpha, beta, delta,

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,280
 and Omnicron was at the height.

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,500
 When I was back in Canada in January,

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,120
 and you remember these lockdowns,

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,900
 they would just randomly lock down your block,

28
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,420
 you remember, and you would be trapped there.

29
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,940
 It was, you had no idea, right?

30
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,940
 You would just be randomly trapped in that quarantine zone.

31
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,180
 And not only was COVID still going on,

32
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,180
 a war started.

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,780
 Ukraine was attacked by Russia,

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,580
 and this left lots of people, refugees,

35
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,580
 running out of Ukraine to other countries.

36
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,580
 And with this war came the threat of nuclear, nuclear war,

37
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,820
 and a lot of sanctions were happening against Russia,

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,300
 and so because of that, energy prices went up,

39
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,940
 and the markets went crazy,

40
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,240
 and we don't know, it's going up and down,

41
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,340
 up and down, up and down.

42
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,340
 And on top of that, 2022, the queen died,

43
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,060
 and that was a very, just shocking thing,

44
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,660
 that the queen had reigned for so many years, and she died.

45
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,500
 But it wasn't all negative, it wasn't all negative.

46
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,960
 It was a tough year, but it wasn't all negative.

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,980
 Travel started to ease up.

48
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,520
 Who's ready to travel again?

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,780
 Yeah, good, I see a couple people admitting it.

50
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:19,900
 And not only was traveling starting to go around,

51
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,900
 we had the best football World Cup match ever, finals ever.

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,740
 A lot of people love Messi, and I'm not a Messi fan,

53
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,260
 but I'm happy for Messi fans, he finally won it.

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,260
 And our world has gotten bigger in terms of population.

55
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,180
 We are now at eight billion people.

56
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,620
 Wow, eight billion people.

57
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,620
 And so 2022, I would say was a year of uncertainty.

58
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,200
 There's social and political uncertainty,

59
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,480
 still protests around the world,

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
 and in Peru and different countries.

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,500
 There's economical and financial uncertainty,

62
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,820
 the fear of recession and housing markets going down,

63
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,080
 and we don't know what's gonna happen with the markets.

64
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,580
 The global health uncertainty,

65
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,060
 we don't know how the pandemic is gonna end,

66
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,200
 or when it's gonna end, or if it's gonna continue on.

67
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,320
 And then there's environmental uncertainty,

68
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,660
 the threat of global warming and climate change.

69
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,940
 There's so much uncertainty in our world.

70
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,420
 And not only is there uncertainty in our world,

71
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,700
 there was also uncertainty in Jesus' time.

72
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,360
 There was the Romans controlling everything, right?

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,020
 And then there was also the Jewish extremists

74
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,560
 called the Zealots, and they were trying to do something

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,020
 to uprise against the Romans.

76
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,360
 There was uncertainty.

77
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,300
 Was Rome continue, would Rome continue to take over Israel?

78
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,900
 Or would Israel finally be free?

79
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,780
 And the disciples were like,

80
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,500
 you're supposed to be the Messiah,

81
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,380
 but you're leaving us?

82
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,300
 You're leaving us?

83
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,140
 Where are you going?

84
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,960
 In the place you're going, we cannot come?

85
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,260
 But you're supposed to be the Messiah.

86
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,020
 You're supposed to save us.

87
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,020
 And Jesus says this in John 14, verse 27, he says this,

88
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,980
 peace I leave with you, peace I give to you,

89
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,980
 not as the world gives, not as the world do I give to you,

90
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,440
 not as the world gives do I give to you.

91
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,500
 Let not your hearts be troubled,

92
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,020
 neither let them be afraid.

93
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,040
 Jesus promises peace.

94
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,040
 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you.

95
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,520
 How would you define peace?

96
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,000
 How would you define peace?

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,700
 All right, go around with someone beside you

98
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,840
 and share what your definition of peace is.

99
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,140
 You have 20 seconds.

100
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,780
 It's interactive, yeah, talk with people around you.

101
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,840
 Go, what is your definition of peace?

102
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,720
 - Sleep well.

103
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,880
 - Sleep well, yeah, I would like it.

104
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,500
 Okay, what is your definition of peace?

105
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,380
 Joseph said sleep well, shout it out.

106
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,740
 Calm, okay, calm.

107
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,160
 Jesus, okay, very good, very biblical answer.

108
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,020
 Nowadays, we define peace

109
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,940
 is like sitting on this beach, right?

110
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,500
 Just peace, just nothing going on,

111
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
 the waves crashing in and out,

112
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,880
 our hands and our feet on the sand.

113
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,540
 We define peace as an absence of conflict.

114
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,220
 No conflict means peace, no war means peace.

115
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,100
 Avoidance of trouble, of struggles, of poverty,

116
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,440
 we define peace as avoidance, absence.

117
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,800
 And we define peace as being relaxed,

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,480
 resting, comfortable, good night's sleep.

119
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:18,240
 And Jesus, in Jewish culture, they would say shalom, right?

120
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,440
 You guys have been to Israel, they would say shalom,

121
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,040
 shalom, peace be with you.

122
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,600
 And that was a way that they would greet each other

123
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,600
 and then they would say bye to each other.

124
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,920
 And I think it was maybe 10 years ago,

125
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,600
 people, teenagers would say peace,

126
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,480
 when they say goodbye, right?

127
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,640
 Peace, bye, peace, something like that.

128
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,280
 But Jesus isn't saying peace, bye, see you later.

129
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
 Jesus is saying something more.

130
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,560
 Firstly, he says peace I leave with you.

131
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,040
 It's as if he's saying that I am peace,

132
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,840
 I provide you peace.

133
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,040
 He says my peace I give you.

134
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,680
 It's a personal peace.

135
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,400
 It's not just any peace.

136
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,400
 He also says this, I do not give to you as the world gives.

137
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,000
 It is prized, it is set apart.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,300
 His peace is different from the world.

139
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,400
 Peace is not just bye, peace is something different.

140
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,040
 And I believe this, peace does not come from your situation.

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,420
 Peace comes from your foundation.

142
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,520
 Let me repeat that.

143
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,080
 Peace does not come from your situation,

144
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,080
 but it comes from your foundation.

145
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,920
 The cause of peace,

146
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,740
 we're gonna learn a couple things today.

147
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,960
 The four things we're gonna learn.

148
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,360
 The cause of peace, the call to make peace,

149
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,440
 the challenge of seeking peace in tough times,

150
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,440
 and the consequence of peace.

151
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,680
 The cause, the call, the challenge, and the consequence.

152
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,320
 The first thing is the cause for peace.

153
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,960
 Who is the cause for peace?

154
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,240
 Jesus says my peace I give to you.

155
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,160
 God's name, one of God's name.

156
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,400
 When Gideon was raising an altar,

157
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,400
 he called Yahweh, Lord, as the Lord of peace.

158
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,280
 That's one of his names.

159
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,520
 Jesus, his name is the Prince of Peace.

160
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,480
 For to us a child is born.

161
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,200
 He shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,

162
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,200
 Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.

163
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,680
 God is the source of peace.

164
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,700
 His name is peace.

165
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,040
 Jesus is the Prince of Peace.

166
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,200
 And Paul also says this,

167
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,200
 that the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.

168
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,380
 Love, joy, peace.

169
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,760
 Peace is one of the fruits of the Spirit.

170
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,640
 It comes from depending on the Holy Spirit.

171
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,960
 It's not from ourselves.

172
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,400
 It is given by the Lord.

173
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
 It's given by the Lord.

174
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,920
 I was in the Philippines and we were doing a mission trip.

175
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,040
 Who's been to the Philippines?

176
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,600
 Raise your hand.

177
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,760
 Ni hao, raise your hand.

178
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,600
 Yes, good.

179
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,120
 I was in the Philippines.

180
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,680
 We were with a missions team together.

181
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,680
 And on our way back from Cebu or another city,

182
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,680
 we had to pass through Manila, okay?

183
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,280
 And to pass through Manila,

184
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,520
 we had to show our passports once again

185
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,400
 to go back to Hong Kong.

186
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,240
 And we were on the trip.

187
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,960
 I think there was like 10 of us or something like that.

188
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,400
 And once we were in Manila, everything was good.

189
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,640
 And we were about to pass customs

190
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,400
 to go to Hong Kong to our next flight.

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,440
 And once we were at customs,

192
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,320
 one of the guys was like, "Oh no."

193
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,320
 And I looked at him, I was like, "What happened?"

194
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,480
 And he's like, "He left his passport on the plane."

195
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,280
 Has anybody done that before?

196
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,560
 You know, the front pocket?

197
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,720
 Yeah, has anybody put their passport in the front pocket

198
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,760
 and forgot it?

199
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,840
 That's what he did.

200
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,640
 And at that time, I was thinking, "Oh no.

201
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,240
 "I guess we're staying in Manila for a couple more days.

202
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,600
 "I guess we'll go to the consulate and get it.

203
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,400
 "If anything, we can stay a couple days

204
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,940
 "and the rest of the team can go first

205
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,920
 "and I'll stay with this guy.

206
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,240
 "We'll get a hotel and stay in Manila

207
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,680
 "and wait for his passport."

208
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,680
 Even though things were frustrating,

209
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,120
 I had a sense of peace.

210
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,720
 Peace knowing that God was in control.

211
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,320
 And we waited in this,

212
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,760
 we went to this office where it was like lost and found

213
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,640
 or something like that.

214
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,000
 And we asked them, "Can you get this passport?

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 "This is the seat number."

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,640
 He left it in front here.

217
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,880
 And we were praying.

218
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,400
 We didn't know whether our flight was boarding.

219
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,880
 So there was a time race.

220
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,920
 We didn't know if we could board this flight.

221
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,040
 We didn't know what was gonna happen,

222
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,800
 but there was a sense of peace

223
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,780
 knowing that God was in control.

224
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,440
 And the passport arrived in time, thankfully.

225
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,400
 And we rushed off running for our flight

226
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,200
 and we made it back to Hong Kong.

227
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,680
 The cause of peace is God.

228
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,120
 True peace comes from knowing God is in control.

229
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,280
 And what happens is we need to place our faith in Him.

230
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,440
 The cause of peace is God.

231
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,180
 And what He does is He calls us to make peace.

232
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,640
 Jesus says this, "Blessed are the peacemakers

233
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,760
 "for they will be called the children of God."

234
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,120
 Blessed are the peacemakers.

235
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,520
 Jesus calls us to be peacemakers.

236
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,100
 Also, Paul writes this in 2 Corinthians,

237
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,820
 "Finally, brothers, rejoice, aim for restoration,

238
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,120
 "comfort one another, agree with one another,

239
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,720
 "live in peace, and the God of love and peace

240
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,140
 "will be with you."

241
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,140
 Jesus calls us to not only have peace, but to make peace.

242
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,160
 And that's not always easy to make peace,

243
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,160
 especially when there's conflict, when people have hurt you.

244
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,140
 But Jesus is the ultimate example of making peace.

245
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,120
 Read this with me, Ephesians chapter two.

246
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,360
 Read this with me, one, two, three.

247
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,220
 "For He, Christ, Himself, is our peace,

248
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,400
 "who has made us both Jews and Gentiles one,

249
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,920
 "and has broken down in His flesh

250
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,400
 "the dividing wall of hostility

251
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,160
 "by abolishing the law of commandments

252
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,280
 "expressed in ordinances that He might create in Himself

253
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,280
 "one new man in the place of two, so making peace."

254
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,520
 Jesus is the ultimate example of making peace.

255
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:33,560
 And how did He make peace?

256
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,240
 He made peace by dying on the cross for us.

257
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:42,240
 There was conflict between us and God because of our sin.

258
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,240
 And so Jesus had to die to make peace

259
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,060
 between this relationship.

260
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,160
 And so the first thing that Jesus calls us

261
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,800
 to make peace with is peace with God,

262
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,320
 as you see in the next slide, peace with God.

263
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,520
 It was purchased by God, it is personal,

264
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,620
 it was purchased on the cross, and it reconciles us to God.

265
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,440
 And in order for us to make peace with God,

266
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,760
 what is required is for us to confess,

267
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:18,640
 agree that God has died for us,

268
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,680
 and that we are sinners, confession.

269
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,600
 The second thing that God calls us to make peace

270
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,100
 is with others.

271
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,860
 Because Jesus died on the cross and made peace

272
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,580
 between God and us.

273
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,560
 He set an example for us.

274
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,340
 Because God first loved us, we also should love others.

275
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:50,220
 He brought peace between the hostilities,

276
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,340
 between Jews and Gentiles.

277
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,140
 Before Jews had the law, they were the promised people.

278
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,700
 Gentiles were outsiders,

279
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,580
 but Jesus brought these people together.

280
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,940
 Now they are one body in Christ through faith.

281
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,560
 We are reconciled to each other through Christ.

282
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,160
 We are a community, one body of Christ.

283
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,220
 I was in Taiwan, we were in Taiwan for a mission trip.

284
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,780
 There's a lot of peace needed in mission trips,

285
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,940
 just so you know.

286
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,300
 And in this mission trip,

287
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,940
 there was a group of us that were very normal,

288
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,980
 just normal, cool people.

289
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,140
 And then there was another group that was very high energy.

290
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,500
 We'd go out there, yeah, let's go share the gospel,

291
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,380
 yeah, let's go meet people.

292
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,180
 And then there was another group that was very slow

293
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,780
 and sick and tired.

294
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:00,300
 And so we had three groups of people on this mission trip.

295
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,000
 And there was a lot of peace that was needed to be made.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,380
 The tired group would be like,

297
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,820
 oh, can we sleep a little longer?

298
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,740
 Can we be a little late?

299
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:18,380
 The high energy people were like, yo, let's go, let's go.

300
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,460
 Okay, that was me, I'm sorry.

301
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,300
 That was me.

302
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,620
 Let's go, let's do something.

303
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,380
 We're here, let's go meet people, let's share the gospel.

304
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,620
 And the tired people would be like,

305
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,340
 ah, I'm a little bit tired, feeling a little sick.

306
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,380
 And there needs to be peace.

307
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,000
 We need to make peace.

308
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,540
 Jesus calls us to peace with God.

309
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,780
 Jesus calls us with peace with each other.

310
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,740
 And Jesus calls us to peace with ourselves.

311
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,900
 Jesus says this, or Paul says this,

312
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,180
 therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.

313
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,020
 The old has passed away, behold, the new has come.

314
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,700
 Our God is a God that loves us.

315
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:10,820
 And God disciplines the ones he loves.

316
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,900
 And in this process of being disciplined,

317
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:21,500
 it takes time and it takes us accepting our weaknesses

318
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,780
 and it takes peace, peace accepting ourselves

319
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,500
 and this process.

320
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:36,220
 Paul also says this, now may the God of peace himself

321
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,260
 sanctify you completely and may your whole spirit

322
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,060
 and soul and body be kept blameless

323
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,620
 at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.

324
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:53,100
 The peace of God will sanctify us, discipline us.

325
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,240
 And we especially need this peace

326
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,420
 in tough, challenging times.

327
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:07,200
 Jesus says this, I have said these things to you

328
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,760
 that in me, you may have peace.

329
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,080
 In the world, you will have tribulation,

330
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,480
 but take heart, I have overcome the world.

331
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,500
 Jesus says we will have trials, we will have tough times,

332
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,380
 we'll have tough financial times,

333
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,500
 we'll have times we're going through physical health

334
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,100
 difficulties, friendship difficulties,

335
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,220
 we will have challenging times with each other,

336
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,220
 with ourselves, but God says that he will be our peace.

337
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
 In him, we may have peace.

338
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,960
 Paul also tells us, do not be anxious about anything,

339
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
 but in everything by prayer and supplication

340
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,800
 with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God

341
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,280
 and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,

342
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,480
 will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

343
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,240
 In the midst of this tough times, difficult times,

344
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,860
 Jesus says that we should not be anxious,

345
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,100
 but in prayer, we should rely on him,

346
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,220
 that his peace would be with us.

347
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:32,780
 I was at a summer camp recently,

348
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,220
 I was at a summer camp recently,

349
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,700
 in the summer, not that recent, I guess,

350
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:46,120
 and I was kayaking, and I was kayaking with a bunch of kids,

351
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,360
 and these kids were like, oh, let's get Johnny,

352
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,120
 let's flip his kayak, and so when he flipped my kayak,

353
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:01,340
 I actually had my phone in a waterproof case,

354
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,180
 but not a floating case, it was a case that sank,

355
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,500
 and so when my kayak flipped,

356
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,140
 and my phone was around my neck,

357
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,980
 it also sank to the bottom,

358
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,540
 and so many things were happening,

359
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,860
 when you get flipped, the water, you're trying to grab air,

360
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,060
 some things are floating, some things are sinking,

361
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,120
 you don't know what's gonna happen,

362
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,220
 your eyes may be burning 'cause of the salt,

363
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,700
 and then I realized, oh, my phone is not floating,

364
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:37,540
 it has sunk, and it was the muddiest waters ever,

365
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,460
 it was zero visibility,

366
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:44,900
 and so I lost my phone at this camp,

367
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,880
 and you could be very frustrated,

368
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,140
 you could blame these kids, you could blame yourself,

369
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,140
 you can blame God, God, why you send me here to help out,

370
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,500
 and I lose my phone,

371
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,060
 and it's not a nice feeling losing your phone,

372
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,860
 all your contacts are there,

373
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,300
 you feel disconnected from the world,

374
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:11,260
 but at that time, in the midst of these circumstances,

375
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,140
 I still had a sense of peace,

376
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,880
 my attitude was, well, God didn't want me

377
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,660
 to have a phone this weekend,

378
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,180
 God wanted me to focus on serving the Lord,

379
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,420
 and loving the people there,

380
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,180
 and that was my attitude, honestly, that was my attitude,

381
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,420
 and all these worries about all these appointments,

382
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,580
 or these people coming to message me,

383
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,180
 I was just like, I'll just leave it up to you, Lord,

384
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,180
 somehow, it will work out, there was a sense of peace,

385
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,700
 when we put our problems in His hands,

386
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,800
 He puts His peace in our hearts,

387
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,340
 peace with God, peace with others,

388
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,040
 peace with ourselves, peace in challenging times,

389
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:07,120
 and the consequence of peace is this,

390
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,260
 the consequence of peace is this,

391
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,980
 deceit in the heart of those who devise evil,

392
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,320
 but those who plan peace have joy,

393
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,000
 the promise of peace comes with joy,

394
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,780
 when we experience the peace of God,

395
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,460
 there is also a sense of joy,

396
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,020
 knowing that He is in control, that He is with us,

397
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,940
 and lastly, blessed are the peacemakers,

398
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,900
 for they shall be called the sons of God,

399
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,780
 when we are making peace with God, with others,

400
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,780
 with ourselves, we are doing what God has called us to do

401
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:01,700
 as His children, we are called to be like our Father,

402
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,700
 like Jesus, Jesus is the Prince of Peace,

403
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,060
 and we're called to be peacemakers,

404
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:14,860
 and when we do that, we are blessed by the Lord,

405
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,860
 the consequence of peace is joy and happiness,

406
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,860
 joy and it's being blessed by our Heavenly Father,

407
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,100
 and the blessings might not come on this earth,

408
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,100
 our blessings might come in the life that comes after,

409
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:41,380
 the consequence of peace is joy and blessing from our Lord,

410
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,740
 and so I said earlier,

411
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,140
 that peace comes not from your situation,

412
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,780
 the true peace comes from your foundation,

413
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,780
 and so when our peace with God upward,

414
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,780
 when our peace with God upward is fully secure,

415
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:07,260
 then we can truly have peace with others outward,

416
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,860
 and we have truly have peace with ourselves,

417
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,420
 when our foundation is strong,

418
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,860
 our foundation, our relationship with God

419
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,900
 is peaceful and full of joy,

420
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:25,780
 then we can truly have peace with others and ourselves,

421
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,420
 and in tough situations.

422
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:34,140
 So how do we have peace in times of uncertainty?

423
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,620
 How do we have peace?

424
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,020
 Peace does not come from your situation,

425
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,780
 but from your foundation,

426
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,860
 and lastly this, peace equals love,

427
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:52,060
 faith plus love plus wisdom plus perseverance,

428
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:57,180
 peace equals faith in God that He is in control,

429
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,380
 that He loves us,

430
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,180
 and He gives me wisdom to face this situation,

431
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,220
 this challenging situation,

432
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,020
 and in this challenging situation,

433
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,340
 I will need perseverance,

434
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,580
 because life is challenging,

435
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,180
 life is challenging,

436
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,020
 in my relationships with others,

437
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,780
 to have peace, I need to have faith

438
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,780
 that God first loved,

439
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,860
 first is the God of peace,

440
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,500
 and He's called me to love others,

441
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,900
 and He gives me wisdom to know how to connect with others,

442
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,700
 and to make peace with others,

443
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,620
 and connecting with others,

444
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,180
 and making peace with others is not easy,

445
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,180
 it requires hard work,

446
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,860
 it requires perseverance,

447
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:48,060
 and so today, what is your foundation?

448
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,700
 What is your foundation?

449
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,420
 As the band comes up,

450
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,340
 I just want us to close our eyes,

451
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,180
 what is our foundation of peace?

452
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,780
 What are we relying on?

453
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:07,380
 Are we relying on ourselves

454
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,460
 as the foundation of peace?

455
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,460
 If we're relying on ourselves for the foundation of peace,

456
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,340
 then if things go wrong,

457
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,540
 then our lives will just go up and down,

458
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,900
 if we're relying on our bank account for peace,

459
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,140
 if those numbers go up,

460
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,100
 or if those numbers go down,

461
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,380
 that's what we're gonna rely on,

462
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,500
 and it's gonna cause us to go up and down,

463
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,580
 what is our foundation of peace?

464
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,180
 Is God our foundation of peace?

465
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,220
 Jesus says this,

466
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,220
 "A wise man builds his house upon a rock."

467
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,420
 A house upon a rock,

468
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,580
 'cause when the waves come crashing,

469
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,180
 it will stand firm.

470
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:03,180
 My prayer to you guys is that Jesus is your foundation,

471
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,620
 your strong foundation,

472
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,220
 you're rooted in him,

473
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,700
 you place your faith fully on him,

474
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,260
 you depend on him for wisdom,

475
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,060
 you know that you are loved,

476
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,340
 and that you persevere with his spirit.

477
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,140
 Let us pray,

478
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,860
 Heavenly Father,

479
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,580
 we thank you that you promised peace to us,

480
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,660
 that you are our peace.

481
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,980
 In this world of uncertainty,

482
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,540
 as we close off 2022,

483
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,340
 we don't know what the next year will bring,

484
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,540
 but we know that if our foundation,

485
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:52,660
 the foundation of our peace is you,

486
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,060
 we can go through any storm,

487
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,940
 any trial,

488
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,820
 anything that comes our way,

489
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,860
 'cause you are our peace.

490
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,940
 Bless us, Lord,

491
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,420
 help us to be peacemakers,

492
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,180
 help us to depend on you.

493
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,460
 In Christ's name we pray,

494
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,300
 amen.

495
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,540
 Let us stand up and respond.
