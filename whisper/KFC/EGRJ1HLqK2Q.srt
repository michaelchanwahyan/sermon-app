1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,480
 Now, we're going to move into our sermon segment, and we're going to do this slightly differently.

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,540
 And the title for today's talk is Tracing Our Steps As We Walk Ahead.

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,840
 Tracing Our Steps As We Walk Ahead.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,600
 And we're actually going to do it as a group effort, remembering the early church that

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,480
 there wasn't heavily reliant on maybe just one person bringing the word.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,080
 In the gatherings that defined the early church, we're recognising that we are all part of

7
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,080
 the body.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,640
 We all have different gifts, and we all have different things to bring to edify the body.

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,320
 And what a great opportunity to give this a go during a season like this and Chinese

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,640
 New Year, where we all get to bring something slightly different.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,240
 And I titled this Tracing Our Steps As We Walk Ahead.

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,320
 And I want to share with you a little story.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,920
 Last week, I went on a spiritual solitude retreat, and I went all the way to the New

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,200
 Territories. Hands up who has been to the New Territories recently.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:11,040
 For those of us who live on Hong Kong Island who think that Kowloon is far, then you don't

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,680
 know a thing. New Territories is even further.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,600
 My family are from a place called Yuen Long. So I went there, and I went to stay overnight

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,240
 in a place called Tin So Wai. Tin So Wai. Actually, it was a hotel that my family used

19
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,120
 to stay at when we used to visit back here.

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,600
 And I woke up the next day, and then I decided just to go for a walk, just to see where the

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
 Lord was taking me.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,800
 And I looked on Google Maps, and I saw a seafood fishing village nearby. So I thought, "Oh,

23
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,520
 well, why don't I walk there?"

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,640
 And so I started walking there. And as I was walking down the road in this place called

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,320
 Lau Fau Sam, and as I was walking towards there, I started getting these childhood memories

26
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,760
 flashing back in my mind.

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,360
 I started recognising the roads that I was walking along. And I was like, "Oh, I've been

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,440
 here before, but I'm not entirely sure why or what I was here for."

29
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,360
 And then as I kept walking, it dawned on me that actually this is the place where my grandparents

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,400
 were buried.

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,080
 And so then I was like, "Oh, well, I'll just keep walking." And then eventually I found

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,880
 the place where they were actually buried.

33
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,360
 And then, of course, it was a Buddhist temple. So I walked in, and then they were all on

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,720
 the wall, huge wall, and I had to walk around.

35
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,280
 It took me probably a good hour to find the picture of my grandparents. And I told my

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,240
 mum, "Oh, look what I found." You know, I found my grandparents. And she was like, "Oh,

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,880
 actually, your great-grandparents are also nearby. So why don't you go and find them

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
 as well?"

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,920
 And then another half an hour later, I found them as well. And as I was reflecting on this

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:51,040
 journey, and I was just sitting there in this Buddhist temple, and I was like, "Wow, I've

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,920
 come a long way, or my family have come a really long way."

42
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,880
 You know, just thinking back that actually my family were from China, from a county called

43
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:09,720
 Bao'an. And then eventually my great-grandparents moved to Hong Kong, settled in the new territories

44
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,960
 in Pingshan. And then from there, that's where my grandparents started to really kind of

45
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,680
 just settle down here.

46
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,760
 Then my dad, I'm sure I've told you guys about my dad before, he was a high school dropout

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,320
 in Yuen Long, couldn't cut it, got sent away to Taiwan. And that was when he met Jesus.

48
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,240
 And then he came back and then we ended up in the UK.

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,760
 And then fast forward all these years, now I, as their grandchild, or as their great-grandchild,

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,240
 and sat there under the picture of my grandparents, and my great-grandparents, but this time as

51
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,960
 a Christian minister.

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,760
 And I was thinking, "Wow, what a journey that my family has been on."

53
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,000
 And as I traced my steps, all I could see was God's hand. All I could see was God's

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,200
 faithfulness and God's goodness, and just this, His working for His glory.

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,240
 And I thought, "What a great thing to talk about as we look and reflect on Chinese New

56
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
 Year."

57
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,040
 And there's really three questions that I've been asking myself when I've been thinking

58
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,760
 about us and the Chinese culture.

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,440
 There's one, where did we come from?

60
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,760
 Two, where are we right now?

61
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,360
 And three, where are we heading?

62
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:29,000
 So as we figure out what we're doing as a culture, as a people, as a nation, it's so

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,320
 helpful to trace our steps first, to see where we've come from, and then to recognise where

64
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,960
 we're at, and then to figure out where we should be heading.

65
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,280
 And those are the three questions I wanted to really address with us today, and also

66
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,480
 ask these lovely people around me.

67
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,560
 The first question is, where did we come from?

68
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,920
 At least in terms of our spirituality, our faith.

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,480
 One of the earliest dynasties in the Chinese culture is the Shang Dynasty.

70
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,280
 And the Shang Dynasty, I think, is the second one on record.

71
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,760
 And the Shang Dynasty, they actually worshipped ancestors, and they treated them as demigods

72
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
 almost.

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,520
 But they also worshipped, ultimately, an OG ancestor, if you will, the ultimate ancestor

74
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,360
 at the very, very beginning of time.

75
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,000
 Did you know that?

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,880
 And do you know what they called this OG ancestor?

77
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,600
 This original ancestor?

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,200
 Shang Di.

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,640
 Song Dai.

80
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,720
 And that's who they worshipped.

81
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,680
 They worshipped this force, this being called Shang Di.

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,560
 And then of course, the Chinese culture has taken lots of different journeys from there.

83
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,200
 It's gone from worshipping one being almost, to then worshipping many, many.

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,840
 Now the Shang Dynasty actually existed in 1500 years before Confucius or Buddha were

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,640
 even born.

86
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,020
 So this was way before then, but of course, Confucius was born, and Buddha, and then religions

87
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,320
 from India started coming in, and then they went from worshipping one thing to worshipping

88
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
 many, many things.

89
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,400
 They worshipped all these different things.

90
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,040
 And then as time progressed, the Chinese culture eventually, maybe in the last century, have

91
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,640
 declared, especially in the mainland, that they are a culture that doesn't worship any

92
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,640
 god.

93
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,720
 Cantonese is "mǒ sān lèng", there is no god.

94
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,560
 And so we've gone from one god to many gods to no god.

95
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:24,840
 And it makes me think, wow, what an interesting story that God is writing in all this.

96
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,240
 And that's where we come from.

97
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,760
 And where are we right now?

98
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,080
 Christianity is growing fast in the Chinese culture.

99
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,080
 God is clearly moving.

100
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,480
 We look at Hong Kong, we look at the churches here, we look at all the things that are going

101
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
 on.

102
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:44,080
 We can say with certainty that God is alive and well, and that he is moving.

103
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,200
 And there's so much in our Chinese culture that is good.

104
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
 There is so much of it.

105
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,000
 And actually, it's one of the questions I want to ask all of us here is, where can you

106
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,360
 see God in our Chinese culture?

107
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,080
 And I want to have you think to yourself, where did you come from?

108
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,360
 And actually, where are you right now, culturally, spiritually?

109
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,520
 The Chinese culture is steeped with just great things like honour, like integrity, like perseverance.

110
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,680
 It's all in line with the teachings of the Bible.

111
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,800
 Yet, of course, as mankind has progressed, as the Chinese, as a people, we have progressed,

112
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,280
 we have also deviated from the ways of God as well.

113
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,000
 And there are many, many things that are now not of God within our culture too.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,720
 Things that strike fear into us, things that cause us to envy, things to fill us with pride,

115
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,240
 putting our faith in the wrong kinds of things.

116
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,320
 And so I think that's part of where we're at right now.

117
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:46,000
 And my question really is, how are we to maintain an appreciation for our culture whilst also

118
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,840
 still honouring God and not compromising our faith?

119
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,320
 Chinese New Year is full of rituals and things that we have to do when we visit friends and

120
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,080
 family, when we meet younger people and we're forced to give them money, which I think is

121
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,760
 totally not of God and not evil, which is why we are resisting from giving these people

122
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
 red pockets.

123
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,520
 Because it's just, I ask myself, is this really of God?

124
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,720
 Only joking, I'll give them something.

125
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,320
 No, you can leave now.

126
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,440
 But that question remains.

127
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,040
 For those of us who are fully Chinese and fully Christians, how do we live out our faith

128
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,880
 in a way that both honours our culture, appreciates our culture, but also honours and loves our

129
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,440
 God and doesn't compromise in our faith?

130
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,680
 These are fascinating questions.

131
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,920
 And finally, where should we be heading?

132
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,920
 Now we've evaluated where we came from and maybe some of the tensions and struggles that

133
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,600
 we have, what should we really be doing?

134
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,880
 As God is moving in our people, what should we be doing?

135
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,920
 How should our hearts be changed?

136
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,240
 How should our mindsets be shifted?

137
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,760
 And I was really just thinking about this and praying about this.

138
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,760
 I was led to a book in the Bible that I thought actually has something very interesting to

139
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,560
 say to us.

140
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,880
 And that book is one that we're very familiar with.

141
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,880
 It's 1 Peter.

142
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,120
 We just went through it and we probably went through it way too fast because there's so

143
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
 much good content there.

144
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,880
 But there's this passage that I wanted to read to us today, just to allow it to really

145
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,720
 seep into our minds and our hearts again.

146
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,200
 And I'll read it to you.

147
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,560
 And of course, Barney's very kindly put it on the screen for us as well.

148
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,520
 1 Peter chapter 1, verse 14.

149
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,400
 As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance.

150
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,200
 But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written,

151
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,960
 you shall be holy for I am holy.

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,440
 And if you call on him as father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds,

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
 conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were

154
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,680
 ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things

155
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,800
 such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without

156
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
 blemish or spot.

157
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,600
 And you look at this passage and you actually think about actually the context in which

158
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,720
 this was written.

159
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,280
 Peter writing to these new believers, seeped in the cultures that they were in.

160
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,600
 And he's asking them and saying, hey, as obedient children, don't conform to these passions

161
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,120
 of your former ignorance.

162
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,640
 Verse 17, you are to live out a new way of life now.

163
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,440
 Why do they have to live out a new way?

164
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,120
 Why do they have to now be holy?

165
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,760
 Again, verse 17, because and if you call on him as father, that is why.

166
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,120
 You see, in the ancient world and actually very much in the Chinese world, the father

167
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,960
 is the one that has the say in the household.

168
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,280
 Whatever the father says goes.

169
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,360
 Everything is dictated and determined by the father.

170
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,720
 And Peter saying here to these believers, hey, you have a new father now.

171
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,800
 You're going to ask yourself that question.

172
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,840
 Who's your daddy now?

173
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,720
 It isn't the ways of the world.

174
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,280
 It isn't the idols of the world from the past.

175
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,080
 You have a new father now.

176
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,520
 And because of that father, that must impact the way you live.

177
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,340
 It means that there are new rules to live by now because of this father.

178
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,680
 And so because of him, you have to transform.

179
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,840
 You have to remind yourself, verse 18, knowing that you are ransomed from the futile ways

180
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,760
 inherited from your forefathers, knowing that you were ransomed.

181
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:35,000
 You know, I always have this question, how is God redeeming the Chinese culture?

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 How is he redeeming it?

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,240
 Like, one of the things that we have now fallen short on, how is God redeeming it?

184
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,880
 And I realised, I think I was asking the wrong question.

185
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,480
 Because actually, God, I don't think, redeems a culture.

186
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,200
 He redeems us from the culture.

187
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,000
 Do you get that?

188
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,360
 He's not necessarily focused on the cultures, which are all man-made, but he seeks to redeem

189
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:02,520
 us from our cultures, from the things of man.

190
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,120
 Because now, because of the blood of Jesus, we now belong to his house, his home, his

191
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,400
 kingdom, his culture.

192
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,640
 He has redeemed us from the world's culture and brought us into his family.

193
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:21,560
 See, Jesus entered at a time where the most prominent and most powerful culture that has

194
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,360
 ever been on this earth was right in its prime.

195
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,400
 And have you ever wondered, why did Jesus choose that moment to come into this world,

196
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,960
 to invade the world, and to set up his throne and to start something, start a kingdom, start

197
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,960
 a revolution that ended up outliving the most powerful empire, outliving, outlasting the

198
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,960
 Roman culture?

199
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,200
 You see, Jesus came to this world not to necessarily dethrone the cultures of this world, not to

200
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,320
 necessarily dethrone the kingdoms of this world, but rather to show a new way, show

201
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,000
 that his way is even higher, and that the economies of this world are flipped upside

202
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,080
 down when it comes to the kingdom of heaven.

203
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,760
 And he ended up starting something that was so much more transformational.

204
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:12,640
 You see, God placed us here in our culture, I believe, to appreciate it, to honour it.

205
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,840
 There are some beautiful, righteous things about the way that we live, but we're also

206
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,320
 needing to be careful in remembering that we are in this world, but we are not of this

207
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,600
 world, that we have been redeemed from the things that are not of God within our culture.

208
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,840
 Romans 12, 2 says this, "Don't conform to the patterns of this world, but be transformed

209
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,960
 by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what

210
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,800
 is good and acceptable and perfect."

211
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,720
 You see, for us as believers, and I feel strongly about this, is we as believers, we need to

212
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:56,160
 test ourselves constantly, check our hearts, and ask ourselves, what about our faith?

213
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,160
 What about our lives has been influenced by the world?

214
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,440
 You know, there's a lot of talk about this, and recently I read a book called Pagan Christianity,

215
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,360
 which really forced me to think, where do the traditions, where do the practices that

216
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,480
 we have inherited come from?

217
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,520
 Are they really of God?

218
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,600
 We all need to ask the question, why do we do what we do?

219
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,640
 Is this righteous?

220
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,720
 Is this holy?

221
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
 Is this of God?

222
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,880
 Because we have a Father in heaven now.

223
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,480
 You see, the problem is, and I feel as though we all maybe have been guilty of this, is

224
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,520
 Christianity did convert the world, but I also wonder if the world ended up converting

225
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,640
 Christianity as well.

226
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,160
 Maybe there are parts of our lives, maybe there's a part of our faith, our own mindset,

227
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,560
 our own psyche, that has been converted, that has been influenced by the world.

228
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,960
 And God is calling us again and telling us, know that you were ransomed from your futile

229
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,160
 ways inherited from your forefathers, and I know for sure I have futile ways in my life.

230
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,160
 I know for sure that I chase perishable things.

231
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,920
 But reminding myself at this time of year that God has redeemed me, redeemed from that

232
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,880
 culture, from that way of thinking.

233
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,240
 And so I wanted to really open that up to ask my lovely brothers and sisters here some

234
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,240
 of those questions.

235
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,560
 And actually it's a great and fun way for us to get to know each other a little bit

236
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,360
 about where we come from.

237
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,960
 And so the first question I want to do is direct to Florence over here.

238
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,000
 Florence, where do you come from?

239
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,800
 Where do your family come from?

240
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,360
 My family came from, so I came from my mom and my dad, who, surprise.

241
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
 Great.

242
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,600
 But my dad is from Maoming, which is around the Guangdong region.

243
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,040
 And then my dad should be fact-checking this and I'm saying the wrong things.

244
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,840
 And my mom is from Laozhou, which is around the Guangxi area.

245
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,400
 And then they both, as in my grandparents were from there, and then they escaped from

246
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,400
 China to Hong Kong.

247
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,240
 And then here we are.

248
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
 Okay.

249
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,800
 So it's your grandparents that moved?

250
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
 Yeah.

251
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
 Okay.

252
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,800
 They moved.

253
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
 Yeah.

254
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
 Brilliant.

255
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
 And that's almost your cultural heritage.

256
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
 What about your spiritual heritage?

257
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
 What's the journey as you trace your steps?

258
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,360
 Where did that come from?

259
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
 Yeah.

260
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,520
 So my grandparents, they weren't Christians and I think some of them turned to other Buddhists

261
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,720
 or quite didn't think that there was a God.

262
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,720
 And then, but my dad's grand, no, my dad's dad, when he first came to Hong Kong, he actually

263
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,320
 was, went to a Catholic church who then helped him a lot with just being, approving his like

264
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,800
 degree to be able to teach.

265
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,440
 And as he met the church there, the father who was there, he got to know God.

266
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,880
 So that was where we kind of first crossed paths with the Lord and the Lord has been

267
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,480
 gracious and revealing more to him just personally in our own family.

268
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
 Wow.

269
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,440
 You know, I find something that's really fascinating about us believers here in Hong Kong is that

270
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,600
 so many of us are actually first, second or maximum third generation believers, maximum.

271
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,680
 And actually it doesn't take us tracing our steps too far back to find when God entered

272
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,000
 our family and when God was in, when Jesus was introduced to us, which is maybe different

273
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,600
 from the States where some of the pastors that I follow are seventh generation pastors.

274
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,880
 So all their lineage comes from pastors.

275
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,440
 It's just a, it's a different kind of experience and history that we have.

276
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,440
 You know, that's fascinating.

277
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,440
 Paul, where do you come from?

278
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,440
 Well, this is a little bit different.

279
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,320
 So I was born and raised in Australia.

280
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,440
 So my mum is first generation Australian and then with English and Scottish descent.

281
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:56,920
 And then my dad is born Swiss and then moved to Australia when he was like early twenties.

282
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:02,840
 So that's, I'm first generation Australian on one side and second on the other side.

283
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
 Oh, I see.

284
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,320
 And what about your, what about your spiritual heritage?

285
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,640
 So I grew up in a Christian home.

286
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,400
 So I was going to a church in Australia since basically I was born.

287
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:23,680
 And then, but my mum and dad both like growing up in Australia and in, and in Switzerland,

288
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,440
 they were kind of around church, but they weren't necessarily from like Christian families

289
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
 themselves.

290
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,840
 So they're kind of both first generation as well.

291
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,240
 And then, yeah, so that's my spiritual heritage.

292
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
 Oh, thank you.

293
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
 Thank you.

294
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,240
 And is this so Julian, what about yourself?

295
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,760
 In terms of cultural heritage, I come from an immigrant Chinese background.

296
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:52,120
 So Malaysian Chinese, and that can be traced back to my great grandfathers who immigrated

297
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,960
 from Southern China to Malaysia in search of a better life there.

298
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:00,140
 And then my grandfather and my father were both born and raised in Malaysia.

299
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,360
 And then my dad moved from Singapore here.

300
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,600
 So I was born and raised here.

301
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,960
 So that's my cultural heritage.

302
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,680
 In terms of spiritual heritage, I can trace that back to my grandfather as well.

303
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,700
 The church had a strong missionary presence in Malaysia at that time.

304
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:23,100
 So he came to faith through, I think it was the Assemblies of God actually, through what

305
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,940
 they were doing there in Malaysia.

306
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:32,300
 And then my dad also came to faith as a young teenage boy through the Brethren Church.

307
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,700
 So I can trace my spiritual heritage back just three generations as well.

308
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
 Oh, interesting.

309
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,900
 And of course, as I hear a story like that, I'm filled with appreciation for missionaries.

310
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,220
 We see in the Book of Acts, all these apostles and missionaries who, facing persecution,

311
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,540
 scattered, but didn't stop, didn't give up, didn't hide, didn't try and conform to the

312
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,860
 patterns of this world.

313
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,220
 But they couldn't help themselves but share the gospel.

314
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:02,780
 And I feel as though all of us are beneficiaries of these spiritual giants, some we know of,

315
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:08,260
 some we don't know of, who actually, if it were not for them being so committed to spreading

316
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,420
 the gospel, we may not even be here as children of God.

317
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,420
 I think that just fills me with praise for how God uses people to work.

318
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,420
 Absolutely.

319
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,420
 Absolutely.

320
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,420
 Christina, what about you?

321
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,420
 Where did your family come from?

322
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:33,420
 Well, I only just discovered that both my parents' grandparents came from Bao'an.

323
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:39,420
 Bao'an is a province in Guangdong.

324
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,420
 Guangdong, yeah.

325
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:49,820
 And my grandparents moved to Hong Kong in search for a better life.

326
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:57,660
 And then my parents, so my dad grew up in Genting and my mom grew up in a place called

327
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
 Lei Ji Wo.

328
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:04,180
 Yeah, it's a little island.

329
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:12,020
 And they both moved to the UK in their teen years.

330
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,300
 And then funnily enough, I came back.

331
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,760
 Very quickly then, I wanted to ask just maybe just the first thing that pops to mind.

332
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
 What is it about the Chinese?

333
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,220
 Let me rephrase this.

334
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,100
 Where do you see God in the Chinese culture from your angle?

335
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,500
 Where do you see God in the Chinese culture?

336
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,340
 I think I see God in how in the Chinese culture, there are also very specific roles for the

337
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,540
 family and there's also just like a sense of duty to the family.

338
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:46,420
 And in my family, my mom's side is a very traditional Chinese culture.

339
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,540
 So then they really valued a lot of that.

340
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:53,500
 And also just in the value of family, which is a huge thing in the Chinese culture.

341
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,620
 You want to gather for all the "Tunin Fa" and all the winter solstice.

342
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,140
 It's just the thing.

343
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:05,380
 And all these are just values that God has as well for us to be family and treasure all

344
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,380
 that.

345
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,060
 Are there any downsides to actually to some of those features?

346
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,340
 Would you say that actually it is a godly thing, but has ended up maybe not being so

347
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,340
 godly?

348
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,340
 Yeah.

349
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,340
 Yeah.

350
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,340
 And I can see that just in the very traditional areas of the heritage from my mom, where in

351
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,460
 the duty, there was a lot of just a lot of shame when you couldn't achieve that kind

352
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:33,260
 of duty or a sense of feeling that you have to be able to do certain things in order to

353
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,300
 get a reward or to in order to feel loved, where it's pushed to the extreme where we

354
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,500
 don't recognize the drive of just doing that thing will be for love or where even though

355
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,100
 there are roles in the family where the women would be supporting the men in their work

356
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,180
 that went very far on that spectrum of patriarchy where the women didn't have opportunities

357
00:22:53,180 --> 00:23:00,260
 to study to be a part of just to take on more of the things and they could where, yeah,

358
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,340
 where in Christ where the love would redeem that.

359
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
 Yeah.

360
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
 That's great to hear.

361
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:09,900
 And Paul, what about you as a, as someone who's kind of learning about the culture?

362
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
 What is it?

363
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,260
 What is it about the culture that you where you see God is clearly working?

364
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:20,100
 One thing that comes across strongly to me, and I think especially at KFCI is just humble

365
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:26,980
 service that comes across a lot, whether it's like from people my own age, but also some

366
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,740
 of the most successful people I've ever met are willing to just serve in ways that are

367
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,820
 in their, in their line of expertise and also not as well.

368
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,020
 So I think that that takes real humility and willingness.

369
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:47,980
 And one other thing I'd say is also just the high value on sort of education.

370
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,740
 It means that people when they really, they really want to know about what they believe

371
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,700
 in so that that desire to really understand the scripture, understand what, what it is

372
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:03,460
 they believe is, is I think really a lot more, a lot more prevalent than in maybe some other

373
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
 cultures.

374
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,460
 Yeah, that's great.

375
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,340
 And yeah, I think there is this, there's maybe built into our cultures and maybe the way

376
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:16,940
 we were raised is this thirst for knowledge, this thirst for being taught to fill, to fill

377
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,420
 our minds with, with good stuff.

378
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,420
 And actually that is good.

379
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,660
 But then of course, when it comes to our own kind of humanity, there's always that risk

380
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,060
 where we, where we, where we yearn and thirst for knowledge.

381
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
 And actually scripture talks about this, Psalm 27.

382
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,420
 You know, the one thing I ask for, one thing I seek is to, of course, be in his presence,

383
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:38,100
 gaze upon your beauty, but also inquire in his temple.

384
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,140
 I think that's such a good thing to have.

385
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,980
 But maybe the things that we neglect are the being in his presence, the gazing upon his

386
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,980
 beauty.

387
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,340
 And those are the things that maybe we as a culture struggle with a little bit more.

388
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
 Yeah.

389
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:56,420
 And then here, what about you guys in terms of, as you, as you know, the Chinese culture

390
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:03,260
 well, are there some things where you think, you know, I really wish God would be bigger

391
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,860
 in this dynamic, in this setting.

392
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,340
 Is there anything that really pops out to you guys?

393
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,780
 How can, how can God really redeem us from certain parts of the culture?

394
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,340
 Well, this is me just thinking off the top of my head, bouncing off what are you guys

395
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,900
 think, but yeah, we, we know how to grind.

396
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,540
 We have a great work ethic, right?

397
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:26,540
 So you know, I, for one, am the benefactor of so much hard work that, you know, my father

398
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:32,940
 put in, my grandfather put in, and, you know, forging a life and a household in Malaysia.

399
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,100
 So there's, there's that, there's that strength of our culture that again, has that dark side

400
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,700
 that I think you just alluded to James, where we, and I think maybe in some ways I've inherited

401
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:49,820
 this, we have a trouble with sitting still and just appreciating what's good around us,

402
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
 being present.

403
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:55,420
 And there is just that constant instinct to just keep working, keep working, keep working,

404
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,420
 like what's next?

405
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,420
 What's next?

406
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,420
 You know, how can we provide for others?

407
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,740
 But you know, there's a, there's, I think there's a real sense in which the Lord wants

408
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:09,940
 us to enjoy Him and to enjoy what He, what He's placed around us as well.

409
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,940
 That just, just that ability to be still and to, you know, to take a step back.

410
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,940
 Thank you.

411
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,940
 Something we've inherited for, for us in our culture.

412
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,340
 That's really good insight there.

413
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,820
 And actually that ties in with, you know, maybe your experience, Christina.

414
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,820
 I think, yeah.

415
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:34,300
 I think growing up, culturally I've always been shown or taught to show respect and honor

416
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,620
 in your parents and to obey, right?

417
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:44,540
 And I would say that that's probably translated into my faith where like, okay, this is Father

418
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,540
 God.

419
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:51,860
 How do I respect, honor and show obedience to God?

420
00:26:51,860 --> 00:27:03,580
 And almost to the point where I idolize the doing of that and forfeit the, you know, the

421
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:12,180
 relational aspect of being with God and being at the foot of, you know, Jesus, you know,

422
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:22,140
 to learn about who He is and what He would actually like me to do in my life.

423
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:29,380
 And I think that's, that's also reflected and tied into the way I relate to my, my dad

424
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,380
 as well.

425
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,380
 You know, so it's, yeah.

426
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,380
 Yeah.

427
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,420
 And of course in this new year where it's the year of the ox, the ox known as the one

428
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:45,780
 that represents hard work, resilience, actually shout out to Andrew Garner at the Vine that

429
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,300
 John was part of as well.

430
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:54,460
 Actually, he reminded us of the fact that actually Jesus or the way the scripture talks

431
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,100
 about the ox or the Jesus' yoke is easy.

432
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
 It's not hard work.

433
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,820
 And actually we can't get there ourselves.

434
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,420
 We actually have to rely on Jesus.

435
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:09,220
 And maybe there's so much in our culture which is like, no, we can do this.

436
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
 We have to do this.

437
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,780
 And of course I can see the Aussie is.

438
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,180
 Someone else can do it.

439
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
 Someone else.

440
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:20,180
 So the Aussies don't quite have that same kind of thinking.

441
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,180
 But we have that.

442
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:26,300
 But that is completely contradictory to what the gospel is saying, that we are saved by

443
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,940
 faith and faith alone.

444
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,420
 And actually it's Jesus who does His work in us.

445
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:39,260
 And sometimes we try, we work so hard to be the one that pleases both man and God.

446
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,860
 And actually that shouldn't be the way.

447
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,340
 And so maybe we're talking here about when we're looking at ourselves as Chinese Christians,

448
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,180
 maybe that's where we've got it the wrong way around.

449
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,220
 That actually we should be Christians who are Chinese.

450
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,700
 Maybe what we're saying is actually our identity as children of God should be first and foremost.

451
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:04,540
 And then it's the fact that we are then made in this culture is a secondary factor.

452
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:09,460
 And as we accept Jesus into our lives, as we recognise God as our Father, things should

453
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
 change for us.

454
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,780
 Julian, you had something that was interesting to share about that as well, right?

455
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,780
 That's right.

456
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,780
 That's right.

457
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,820
 As I touched on, I have a more plural background with growing up here in Hong Kong, but my

458
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,820
 parents are from Malaysia.

459
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,460
 So I identify with the label third culture, Kay, which some of you might be familiar with,

460
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:32,820
 where you have a sense of both belonging to multiple cultures, but at the same time feeling

461
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:39,260
 a bit alienated from each one because you don't quite fit perfectly into one mould.

462
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,220
 So that's a dynamic I've just been aware of throughout my life.

463
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:48,380
 But I think as a result of that background, I particularly appreciate places in Scripture

464
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,460
 that talk about how the kingdom of Christ transcends cultures.

465
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,940
 So the passage I wanted to share with all of you tonight was from Revelation 7, which

466
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,700
 is the Apostle John's vision of the new creation and what that's going to be like when Christ

467
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
 comes again.

468
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:12,060
 And so I'll just read from Revelation 7, verse 9, starting from verse 9.

469
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,300
 After this I looked and behold, a great multitude that no one could number from every nation,

470
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,580
 from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the

471
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,140
 Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, and crying out with a loud

472
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,380
 voice, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb."

473
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:37,940
 So as I was just reading that again, I'm struck by maybe the fact that, yeah, that picture

474
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:43,820
 of the kingdom resonates with me, how Christ came to save both Jew and Gentile.

475
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,860
 He broke down the cultural hostilities between them then, and he's capable of breaking down

476
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,620
 those same barriers today.

477
00:30:52,620 --> 00:31:00,460
 So I think I just appreciate that more as maybe, yeah, with my particular background

478
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,620
 and how my true identity, as you said, James, is as a citizen of heaven.

479
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,660
 That's how Paul would phrase it.

480
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,660
 That's where we're going.

481
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,660
 That's where we're journeying towards.

482
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:17,540
 Well, at the same time, just the final thought, just appreciating what you said about how

483
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,820
 we're Christians who are Chinese.

484
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:27,860
 So what I find really interesting about that passage is I just get a real sense that the

485
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,300
 gospel and Christ's kingdom transcends cultures, but it doesn't erase cultures.

486
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:41,940
 You can see how those nations are still somewhat distinct in their features, and that all comes

487
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,220
 under Christ's kingdom.

488
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:50,820
 So I think for me personally, that's meant that I've felt more happy to more recently

489
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:58,460
 to get to know my roots more, to improve my Cantonese, to work on that side and understand

490
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,460
 where I've come from.

491
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:06,500
 And that's all good and well and part of the Christian life as well for me, I would say.

492
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
 Guai jiang.

493
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
 Guai jiang.

494
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,940
 Hey, just on that, before I wrap up, as I gave you guys a few days to just mull and

495
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:19,980
 think about this, for you to share with our church family here, were there any passages

496
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,220
 of scripture or words from God that really resonated in your heart or maybe you felt

497
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,980
 as though God was speaking to you about that really ties in with what we've just talked

498
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:34,100
 about in terms of what does God have to say about the way we live?

499
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,820
 Yeah, I have something to share.

500
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,220
 And the passage is from Ephesians.

501
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,060
 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing.

502
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,620
 It is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.

503
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,500
 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand

504
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
 that we should walk in them.

505
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:02,500
 And just as I was reflecting on my entire family's journey throughout all of these generations,

506
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,300
 and just the redemption God has had on just a completely broken family where they wouldn't

507
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,700
 even talk together on my mother's side, to now, yesterday, just sitting together at the

508
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:17,220
 dinner table, seeing gifts exchanged, to see that God's grace is able to redeem all of

509
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,900
 us.

510
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,220
 And it's not any of our doing.

511
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,980
 It's the gift of God, not a result of our works.

512
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,940
 But also in this time to not forget beauty and also the duty that there is, and how there

513
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:34,660
 was a duty to the family, there was a duty to provide and to just do what they can for

514
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,100
 the family, much like our family of God.

515
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:43,100
 And all of this is also just, yeah, we are God's workmanship created in Christ so that

516
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,460
 we can walk in them.

517
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,580
 So that there is that, yes, that there is a lot of grace for us and where we fall and

518
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,060
 where we are unable to just be there.

519
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:58,540
 But God also calls us so that we can continue to walk in his work and he will supply us

520
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,660
 in his will and his kingdom.

521
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
 Thank you.

522
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,660
 Praise God.

523
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,660
 Thank you for that.

524
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,660
 Christina, anything that really struck your heart?

525
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:16,180
 Yeah, I think it's very similar to the lines of Flora.

526
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:25,900
 I've been studying Ecclesiastes and it's very sad and it's like, "Oh, woe is me," and all

527
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,580
 that kind of stuff.

528
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,700
 But something struck me that was different this time.

529
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,340
 Let me read it.

530
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:41,020
 Ecclesiastes 5.18, it says, "Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat

531
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:47,660
 and drink and find enjoyment in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few

532
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,100
 days of his life that God has given him.

533
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,620
 For this is his lot.

534
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:59,300
 Everyone also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them and

535
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,180
 to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil.

536
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:09,220
 This is the gift of God, for he will not much remember the days of his life because God

537
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,300
 keeps him occupied with joy in his heart."

538
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:23,940
 And that has just, yeah, just warned me so much because as an ox, year of the ox, and

539
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,340
 I think a part of the environment.

540
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:33,620
 That means she's 24 years old, by the way.

541
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:42,460
 I think cultural background and also family background, working hard is something that's

542
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,460
 a must.

543
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,700
 That's so ingrained in me.

544
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:54,260
 But here, actually, while Ecclesiastes is so much about vanity and things like that,

545
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,540
 everything is like chasing after the wind.

546
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,700
 This is saying, "Hey, eat, drink, and be merry."

547
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
 Eat, drink, and be merry.

548
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:10,180
 And yeah, I just want to encourage all of us to do that.

549
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:16,340
 And whilst working hard is great, we should do that, but we should also enjoy the things

550
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,860
 that God has blessed us with.

551
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,860
 Thank you.

552
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,860
 And Paul?

553
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:26,260
 Yeah, I mean, mine is almost more like an encouragement, actually.

554
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,300
 So to go back to what I was talking about before, which really stands out to me is that

555
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,300
 humble service.

556
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,500
 So Galatians 5, 13 stuck out to me.

557
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,820
 "For you were called to freedom, brothers, and only do not use your freedom as an opportunity

558
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,300
 for the flesh, but through love serve one another."

559
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,900
 I have a translation that says, "Humbly serve one another."

560
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:56,900
 And over this as well, the thing that also stuck out to me in this, this passage is talking

561
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:07,100
 a lot about how that church was to actually help people to come and know God.

562
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:15,620
 And actually that humble service and that love is really powerful and really, it moves

563
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,540
 a lot and it goes a long way.

564
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:23,540
 So that's my kind of encouragement, and to say that, that comes through and to continue

565
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
 on.

566
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,540
 Thank you.

567
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,540
 Thank you so much for that.

568
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:32,620
 Hey, and actually I've really cherished being able to just have here, you guys just bring

569
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:36,540
 something that God's placed on your heart and share what's been, he's been talking to

570
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,540
 you through his word.

571
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:42,180
 But I just wanted to wrap up here and maybe, I asked three questions at the beginning.

572
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,980
 I asked, where did we come from?

573
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,980
 Where are we right now?

574
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,660
 And where are we heading?

575
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,300
 Maybe I want to finish by turning those questions to you.

576
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:56,260
 And those questions, and I would love for you to ask yourself and really, and reflect

577
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,220
 on and then take before the Lord and ask him as well.

578
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,260
 And those questions are the same, but maybe instead of we, we switch it around to have

579
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
 the word I.

580
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,500
 And maybe ask yourself, where did I come from?

581
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:14,500
 As you look back on your own life, as I did, as I went on that journey from Tien Tso Wai

582
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:20,300
 to Lao Tso San, as I walked, as I reflected on where I came from, as I sat beneath my

583
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,540
 grandparents' picture, recognizing the story that God has been writing on my life, my question

584
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,820
 to you is, where did you come from?

585
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:32,660
 Now, I'm not talking necessarily just about cultural heritage, but about your spiritual

586
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,540
 heritage or just your life in general.

587
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,300
 What has God been doing in your life?

588
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,140
 Because one of the great things about moving forward is also remembering that we need to

589
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,500
 look back to be grateful.

590
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,140
 Gratefulness is so key, it's such a key theme in scripture.

591
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,300
 It's such a key part of our own faith and our own maturity.

592
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,220
 As you look back, can you see God's hand in your life?

593
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:01,700
 Can you see the faithfulness that he's shown you, the goodness that he's poured out on

594
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,700
 you?

595
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,980
 And then from there, really the next question is, where are you right now?

596
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,740
 Where are you right now?

597
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:14,940
 When it comes to your faith, when it comes to how you as an individual, as a child of

598
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,620
 God, how do you interact with the culture around you?

599
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,620
 Are you more culture rather than Christian?

600
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,340
 Are you more Chinese rather than you are Christian?

601
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:32,140
 Or does your faith really come first and foremost at the top of your list in terms of priority?

602
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:37,780
 Recognizing that actually people will look at you differently if you are first and foremost

603
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,780
 Christian.

604
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,020
 1 Peter 4, Gabriel preached on this.

605
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:49,340
 There are those who knew you from the past won't understand your new way of life, won't

606
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,580
 understand why you aren't joining them in doing the things that they do.

607
00:39:54,580 --> 00:40:00,020
 But still recognizing that you have been ransomed, you have been rescued and redeemed from the

608
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,020
 things that are not of God.

609
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:07,300
 But it's interesting, 1 Peter also says, even though we stand out from them, even though

610
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:13,540
 we don't do the things that they do, 1 Peter 2, verse 12, says this interesting passage,

611
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:18,380
 keep your conduct among the Gentiles honourable so that when they speak against you as evildoers,

612
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,420
 they may see your good deeds and glorify God.

613
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,340
 So even though we may not do all the things that the world does, maybe there are traditions,

614
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,500
 maybe there are things that our families will be doing over this weekend, but maybe we don't

615
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,540
 want to do.

616
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,380
 But Peter is also saying here, keep your conduct honourable.

617
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:40,540
 Be righteous, but don't be a jerk about it.

618
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,180
 Follow Jesus, but don't stamp on the people around you either.

619
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,980
 Keep your conduct honourable.

620
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:52,260
 And maybe the final question is this, where are you heading?

621
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,500
 Where are you heading?

622
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:00,700
 Considering your past, considering where you've come from, considering where you are right

623
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:06,060
 now, all the things that you're holding in balance, all the tensions that you are experiencing,

624
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,940
 where does God want you to head?

625
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,340
 Because often when we're asking God, where do you want us to go, where do you want us

626
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,340
 to go?

627
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,780
 It's helpful to look back, to see how far we've come, that actually we're not where

628
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,780
 we used to be.

629
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,540
 Now we're not where we want to be, but we're definitely not where we used to be.

630
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:25,780
 And it gives us encouragement, it gives us hope that God is still working in our lives,

631
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:31,180
 and gives us maybe a little bit of a hint as to what he is planning for us.

632
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:40,140
 Because we are all uniquely made to be in the unique family and work and education settings

633
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:43,340
 surrounded by the people that we're surrounded by.

634
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,300
 God has a very clear and unique calling on all of our lives.

635
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,380
 And it's up to us to really spend time with him to find that out.

636
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:59,220
 And remembering, and finally, as you trace your steps, as you remember the unique place

637
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,100
 that you are in right now, and the unique place that God is calling you to.

638
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:10,980
 That his call for us is not to redeem the culture, but to be redeemed from the culture.

639
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,940
 To stand out, to be a blessing to those around us.

640
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:20,220
 And recognising none of that is easy, because people look at you strange when you don't

641
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,540
 conform to the patterns of this world.

642
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:30,460
 But also remembering that Jesus set us that example in how to step into a culture.

643
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:34,540
 And he stepped into the most powerful one, which maybe has lots of parallels with the

644
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,300
 ones that we've got right now.

645
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:41,980
 He stepped into that, not to condemn it, but to save it.

646
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,340
 Not to condemn it, but to save it.

647
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:50,860
 In fact, he sacrificed himself for that culture and ended up rescuing all of us.

648
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,500
 He stood out and he was different.

649
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,180
 And he ended up giving up his life so we wouldn't have to.

650
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,220
 So we could live a life that is abundant.

651
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,180
 So we could gain a true abundant life.

652
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:07,180
 So this Chinese New Year, my encouragement to all of us is, as well as sharing blessings,

653
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:12,380
 is eat, drink, be merry.

654
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,580
 Don't spread COVID.

655
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,900
 Stay positive, test negative.

656
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:24,060
 Don't enjoy the blessings that God has given you, but remember to also stand for the things

657
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,900
 that Jesus stood for in the most honourable and loving way.

658
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,020
 Because in him, we have a new father now.

659
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:38,260
 And this father in heaven allows us, compels us to play by new rules.

660
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,420
 And these rules give life.

661
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,420
 We are Chinese.

662
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,620
 Most of us are Chinese.

663
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:53,620
 But we are now first and foremost, children of God, citizens of heaven.

664
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,700
 May that be a blessing to all of you.

665
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,980
 Let me end with a word of prayer before Paul leads us in a song of response.

666
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,860
 Let's pray.

667
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,780
 Father in heaven, we come before you.

668
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,740
 As one day we all will, all tribes and all tongues.

669
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:16,780
 And recognising it doesn't matter what race we are, what culture we come from, but that

670
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:21,380
 we are all your children.

671
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:28,780
 And you paid for us with a price, a large one.

672
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,820
 You died as a ransom for many.

673
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,300
 And now we are free.

674
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:40,620
 Free not to conform to the patterns of this world, but to love this world.

675
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:46,260
 So Lord, we pray that you will give us wisdom on how to navigate the challenges that we

676
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,180
 face living in a culture such as this.

677
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:54,460
 But may we appreciate and honour all the things that are of you that we find in this world

678
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,780
 around us.

679
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:04,500
 And may we also in love stand for truth to those things that are not of you.

680
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:08,740
 And as we end with this song, we remember that we are all your children.

681
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,740
 We are united.

682
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:14,020
 Just as it says in Corinthians 12.

683
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:17,860
 That we are all of the same love and the same mind and the same spirit.

684
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:22,660
 We are all part of the same body.

685
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,620
 We are one.

686
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,980
 And may the world see our unity and believe in you.

687
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,780
 And it's in your son's precious name that we pray.

688
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,320
 Amen.
