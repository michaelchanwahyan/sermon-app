[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.040]   I had studied with the Bacca Graduate University program under my esteemed mentor and professor,
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.760]   the late Ray Bacca.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:28.200]   Can you imagine how excited I was to receive a gift from none other than Ray himself?
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:39.000]   I was told that all Bacca graduates, and that would have included our beloved Pastor Lam,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.480]   received the exact same gift.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.720]   It was done up in a beautiful package with a ribbon.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.240]   I was so excited.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.000]   I was wondering what it was.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.920]   I couldn't wait to open it.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.680]   My mind was racing with possibilities.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:25.320]   Can you imagine how I felt when I finally opened it and I found this?
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.760]   A white towel.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:37.280]   A white towel, and can I say, not wishing to be rude or ungrateful, more like mini-so
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.720]   than Lane Crawford.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:53.960]   But the point was, and the whole point of this series, Dr. Ray wanted to remind each
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:07.000]   of his graduates that the doctoral degree was only of any value if it led to the metaphorical
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.040]   washing of feet.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.760]   That saved people, served people.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.120]   We just heard John 13, Bonnie read it so beautifully.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.040]   Jesus said, "When he had washed their feet and put it on its outer garments and resumed
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.440]   his place, he said to them, 'Do you understand what I've done to you?
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.320]   You call me teacher and Lord and you are right, for I am.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:45.560]   If I then, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, then you ought to wash one another's
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.640]   feet.'"
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.440]   Let me put this into context.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.160]   This is Thursday in Passion Week.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.160]   It's the day before Good Friday.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.320]   It was just before the Last Supper.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.320]   Jesus knew that he would die tomorrow.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.400]   We read this when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.440]   Father.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.320]   It leads me to a question.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.360]   What would you do?
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   What would we do?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.320]   If we knew tomorrow we would die?
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.840]   And to boot, die a barbaric, torturous death.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.920]   A death that was reserved for common murderers.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.840]   I'll tell you what Jesus did.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:14.320]   After Jesus, who had committed no crime, he began to wash their feet.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.200]   Peter's reaction may have been the same as ours.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.600]   This is bizarre.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:29.240]   We read it.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:42.400]   He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?"
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:51.640]   Now we should, however, remember that foot washing was not an alien or strange action
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.120]   at all.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.520]   In point of fact, it was a much needed service for those who had traveled the dusty and dirty
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.440]   roads where Jesus and his followers traveled daily.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.240]   No one wore socks because there were none.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:27.280]   It was actually an act of honor on behalf of a host to wash a guest's feet.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.480]   And it was a sign of dishonor not to do so.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.760]   It was not uncommon for wives to wash their husband's feet and for children to do the
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.920]   same for their parents.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:55.400]   Peter, understandably perhaps, was not at all happy with Jesus, his master, becoming
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:02.440]   the servant of anyone, especially the disciples.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.520]   Peter just did not feel that Jesus should act like a servant, but especially not as
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.800]   Peter's servant.
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.880]   It was unthinkable.
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.240]   I love Peter.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:24.720]   As usual, he speaks what he feels without giving it a whole lot of thought.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:31.160]   So Jesus tells him to his face that he has to wash Peter's feet.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:41.680]   Peter, however, remains skeptical and really is not in line with Jesus's thought process.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.560]   Continuing to miss the point, Peter asked Jesus to also wash his hands and his head
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.280]   and his feet.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:58.000]   Jesus replied that a person who is already clean does not need to wash his whole body,
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   have it washed again, but their feet would still need attention.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.360]   Let me explain that.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:12.600]   Jesus is saying, "When you first come to me, you are bathed.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.480]   You are clean all over."
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.120]   We symbolise that, don't we, in baptism.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:23.560]   This is what the Bible calls justification by faith.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:31.880]   It is a washing away of all the guilt and sin of past life, present and future.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:38.880]   But as you walk through life, Jesus knows that your feet will be defiled during your
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.520]   walk and that needs to be washed away.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.620]   Then Jesus goes on to say that not everyone who was with him was clean.
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.400]   He was, of course, referring to Judas.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:10.000]   Now you will probably be aware that Jesus was setting an example so that we, yes, us,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.040]   would wash the feet of others.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:23.400]   Now up until this point in John's Gospel, we have seen Jesus doing work that no one
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.920]   had ever done before.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:33.480]   We talked about a couple of weeks ago, making water into wine, giving sight to the blind,
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.320]   raising the dead.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:49.600]   But now he does what almost anyone can do, but what few want to do.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.640]   Can I say that again?
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:09:04.480]   Now Jesus does what almost anyone can do, but what few want to do.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.480]   He washes feet.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:19.320]   The King does the work of a slave.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:26.260]   And in doing so, Jesus brings to a head a question, one that has dominated the Serving
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.640]   the Community series.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:35.280]   To what extent is Jesus' work an example for our own work?
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:40.560]   It would be easy to answer, not at all.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.480]   After all, none of us are the Lord.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.400]   None of us die for the sins of the world.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:10:00.200]   But when he washes the disciples' feet, Jesus explicitly tells them, and by extension, is
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:07.040]   telling us tonight, that we are to follow his example.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.680]   Let's read it, I'll repeat it.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:17.720]   If I then, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash one another's
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.120]   feet.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:31.080]   Jesus is an example we are meant to follow, so far as we are able.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:39.360]   The attitude of humble service should accompany all we do.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:51.120]   If a CEO walks the trading floor in an investment bank, it should be as if he is coming to wash
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.480]   the dealer's feet.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:05.080]   So too, the hotel room attendant should clean the bathroom floors as if being there to wash
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.480]   the hotel guests' feet.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:20.000]   This is not so much a matter of action, but attitude.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.320]   I mean, both the CEO and the hotel room attendant can probably serve people better through activities
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:34.880]   other than washing feet, even if the employees or the customers were willing to have it done.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:42.240]   But they should see themselves as performing humble service.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:55.760]   Jesus, the Spirit-filled teacher who reigns over the entire universe, deliberately performs
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:05.680]   a concrete act of lowly service to demonstrate what ought to be the habitual attitude of
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.520]   his people.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:16.240]   By doing so, he both demonstrates to his followers and demands from his followers humble acts
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.680]   of service.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.240]   Why?
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:34.760]   Because doing so makes us realize that godly work is performed for the benefit of others,
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:42.920]   not merely for the fulfillment of ourselves.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:48.940]   I said at the beginning of the subject of this sermon was serving blesses me.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.720]   Now I want to concentrate on verse 17.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.840]   I'll read it again.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:03.760]   If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.000]   Let me repeat that.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.960]   If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:19.560]   You will be blessed.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.080]   Why?
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:31.800]   Because serving ensures that our life mission is on the right track.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.600]   Can I just say that?
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   The byproduct on being on right mission is a blessed life.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.040]   Now read my lips.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.440]   Church is not a bless me club.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:56.840]   You know, don't we pray something like this, "Lord, bless me with a full bank account,
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:05.680]   a full stomach, the job, the relationship, the life I've always craved for."
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:14.960]   I need to tell you tonight, seeking a blessed life is not your mission.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:20.880]   What your mission is this, two verses in Matthew.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:28.380]   Your mission is you are the light of the world.
[00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:35.360]   Your mission is let your light shine before men.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:43.160]   We are to glorify God in the way we live our lives.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:49.560]   Your mission is not to seek happiness for happiness sake.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:58.360]   I need to tell you and tell you again, you are blessed when you are on the right mission.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:05.840]   If anyone didn't need to humble himself to wash the feet of a bunch of fishermen, it
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:09.920]   was Jesus.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:16.280]   But because he knew he was the Lord of the universe and because he was not worried about
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:25.040]   his self image, he was able to show his love in humble service.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:35.240]   He took up the towel and basin and stooped to serve.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.800]   What an example for all of us.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:47.160]   You see, foot washing is not about foot washing.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.800]   Can I say it again?
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.880]   Foot washing is not about foot washing.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:59.560]   It's about serving others at personal sacrifice.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:08.640]   It's about humbling ourselves when we don't have to because we don't have to.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.440]   It can start very simply.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.240]   It can start by sending someone an encouraging note.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.280]   I've encouraged this before.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.000]   Send someone an encouraging note.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.200]   It's a gift we can give that costs us nothing.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:34.000]   Pick a friend, pick a family member each week and send an email, a text, a handwritten note
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.040]   telling that person you're proud of them, you're praying for them and that you're here
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:41.880]   to help.
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.680]   That's washing feet.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.720]   It can start by watching the children of a neighbour who has good reasons for needing
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.040]   to get out of the apartment.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:57.760]   It can start by listening to a colleague or a friend who needs to talk when you don't
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.120]   have time to listen.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:05.240]   It's giving ourselves when we don't have to.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.880]   It's walking and talking with Jesus on the road that we call life.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.940]   It's about sharing a meal.
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:20.840]   It's about standing at the foot of a cross and in faithfulness standing by an empty tomb
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:29.800]   as the darkness is lifted and life becomes hopeful once again.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:41.360]   When I said that last sentence, my mind invariably turned to Mary, the mother of Jesus.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.520]   Can I be honest tonight?
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:50.240]   I, given that it's Mother's Day tomorrow, I was looking for an interchange to switch
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:18:00.360]   the direction of this sermon towards mothers and Mary responds perfectly.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:06.600]   Scripture is full of mothers who demonstrate Christlike, servant-hearted qualities and
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.320]   Mary tops the list.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:18.640]   Mary said, "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:24.200]   Let it be to me according to your word."
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.760]   Wow.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:31.640]   Wouldn't this be a great prayer for us all to pray?
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.680]   Let's look at the context of these words.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:41.960]   Mary is without doubt the most well-known and revered woman in the Bible.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:50.360]   The scriptures explain that God chose Mary to be Jesus' mother, granting her one of the
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:57.160]   most important and transformational roles in human history.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:04.080]   Mary questioned how pregnancy was possible and she was initially troubled by the angel's
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.520]   appearance.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:14.840]   But once she learned of the reason for Gabriel's visit, she responded to the life-changing
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.200]   news with a heart that was fully open to God's will.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.880]   "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.720]   Let it be me according to your word."
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.860]   And she broke out in song.
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:34.400]   She breaks into a song which we now know as the Magnificat.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.720]   And it starts like this.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.240]   "My soul magnifies the Lord.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:45.400]   My spirit rejoices in God my Saviour, for he has looked on the humble estate of his
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.400]   servant.
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:57.160]   For behold, from now on, all generations will call me blessed.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:06.300]   For he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name."
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:14.160]   Mary was blessed because she was on the right mission.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:21.180]   If Mary is almost certainly the most famous mother in the Bible, I want to look at another
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:28.660]   mother of whom there are just 12 verses in the book of Exodus.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:36.380]   I was privileged to hear a sermon a few weeks ago about Moses' mother, Jochebed, a woman
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:44.460]   who effectively linked serving on one hand and blessing on the other.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:52.660]   The Bible tells us that Jochebed went above and beyond to save her little boy's life.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.220]   The background is at the time of Moses' birth.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:05.060]   The Egyptian pharaoh demanded that midwives kill every Hebrew boy born in Egypt, something
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:10.720]   done in an effort to control the Hebrew population.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:18.380]   We read in Exodus 1 that the Hebrew midwives refused to participate in the infanticide
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:23.980]   and deceived Pharaoh so they could avoid killing the baby boys.
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:24.980]   Read this.
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:31.220]   "But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:33.180]   the male children live.
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:38.380]   So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, 'What have you done?
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.900]   Why have you let the male children live?'
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:47.140]   The midwives said to Pharaoh, 'Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:51.140]   They are vigorous and they give birth before the midwife comes to them.'"
[00:21:51.140 --> 00:22:03.700]   And what Moses' mother Jochebed did, she hid Moses in a basket of bulrushes and set him
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:09.620]   afloat in the Nile River to preserve his life.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:16.420]   Even Pharaoh's own daughter disobeyed the decree when she found Moses in the basket
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:23.100]   and she took pity on him, adopting him as her own child.
[00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:30.860]   So Moses was raised as the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:39.500]   Jochebed made the sacrifice not only to ignore the king's mandate and hide her son for three
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:48.660]   months, but to then selflessly release him so that he could survive and be cared for
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.820]   by Pharaoh's daughter.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.060]   Now here comes the blessing.
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:23:04.940]   In an amazing turn of events, Jochebed became Moses' nurse while Pharaoh's daughter raised
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.820]   him.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:15.620]   An effort that kept her connected to her beloved son and she got paid for it.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.420]   Amazing.
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:24.060]   Exodus 2, 9-10 tells us what happened after Pharaoh's daughter discovered Moses in the
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:29.700]   basket in the Nile and hired Jochebed to nurse the boy.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:36.500]   And Pharaoh's daughter said to him, "Take this child away and nurse him for me and I
[00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.340]   will give you your wages."
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:42.540]   So the woman took the child and nursed him.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:48.700]   When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son.
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:56.700]   She named him Moses because she said, "I drew him out of the water."
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.260]   That's what the name Moses means.
[00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:06.220]   Although Jochebed has one of the shortest stories in the Bible, her life has some truly
[00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:13.180]   life-changing lessons because of who she was.
[00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:19.140]   In fact, her name means God's glory.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:25.460]   In fact, we can say, I'll put it on the screen, Jochebed was blessed because she was on the
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.540]   right mission.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:38.460]   My friends, I could go on and give examples of, biblical examples like Naomi who built
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:43.660]   up a relationship with her daughter-in-law Ruth, who would become through Boaz, part
[00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.140]   of the lineage, the ancestor of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:53.820]   Sarah, who became pregnant in her 80s and gave birth to Isaac, the child of promise.
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:25:00.060]   Hannah, who trusted God in her barrenness and was rewarded by giving birth to Samuel,
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:05.860]   who plays a key role in the transition from the judges to the kings under Saul and again
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.340]   in the transition between Saul and David.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:19.540]   But I want us to recognize mums in 2023.
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.100]   I want us to recognize mums here in Hong Kong.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:31.260]   I want us to recognize mums at KFCI.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:39.620]   We as a church have recognized those who serve the poor, who serve asylum seekers amongst
[00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:45.220]   others and it is right for us to do so.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:52.500]   But today we want to do as the fifth commandment tells us, to honor our mothers.
[00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.060]   Now I know that's half of the commandment.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:26:01.900]   Dads, you're going to have to wait till Father's Day on June the 18th.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:11.460]   It has been said a mother is a person who seeing there are only four pieces of pie for
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:20.140]   five people promptly announces she didn't care for pie.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:28.220]   Famous Indian writer, Dr. Nitya Prakash wrote this, "Mothers hold their children's hands
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:36.340]   for a short time, but their hearts forever."
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:44.340]   And a favorite Jewish proverb and one I heartedly agree with, "God could not be physically be
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:49.720]   everywhere, so therefore he created mothers."
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:27:00.100]   The clear cut definition of a mother is one of a selfless service to another.
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:11.900]   Mother or mom or as you Americans say, mom, as she is lovingly known, is always really
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:20.620]   good at putting the needs of others before her own.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:27.020]   We're going to honor moms in a few moments.
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:34.300]   I was going to give you 50 ways to serve moms, but I decided not to, but to give you one.
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:38.940]   I'm going to suggest just one.
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:48.060]   Write a poem or heartfelt letter expressing your love and appreciation to your mom.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:56.220]   If you're like me, you're almost passed on to glory, still sit down and do it.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.820]   It's good.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:06.020]   What we're going to do here is we're going to pray for moms.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:12.060]   We also have a gift for them from our church.
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.940]   But before that, I'm going to ask two special women.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.140]   I need two chairs on the stage.
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.020]   Ryan, can I just have two chairs on the stage?
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:22.340]   I'm going to ask two special women to come forward.
[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:30.460]   One who's just been a mom for a few months and one who's been a mother for almost 48
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.460]   years.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.460]   I'm going to ask them to come forward.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:38.340]   Sandra and Michelle.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:48.940]   Let's welcome them.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:55.300]   Now I've got to tell you that originally my plan was to wash the feet of all the mothers
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.300]   in the church.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:08.340]   Now, I reckon that maybe not all of you wanted that, not specifically.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.020]   I'm going to wash the feet of these two women.
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:18.560]   One who's just become a mom with a baby and one who's been a mom and a grandmom for almost
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:21.260]   half a century.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:27.980]   As we do this, this is symbolic of us wanting to wash the feet of all of our moms in this
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.980]   church.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:36.420]   Then what we're going to do after that, actually moms, we're going to pray for you.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.300]   Please take this as a proxy for all of you.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:43.300]   We appreciate you all.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:49.280]   I've got the shortest serving mom and the longest serving mom here today.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.160]   I feel so excited.
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.560]   You need to take your shoes and socks off.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.560]   Shall I do that for you?
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   You want me to do that for you as well?
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.120]   You want me to do that for you as well?
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.800]   Do it like this at home.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.440]   We're getting the secrets now, right?
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   Don't buy Michelle a pair of shoelaces.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.440]   I'm just going to tell you that.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.440]   She doesn't use them.
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:25.500]   Michelle is a standing for the moms in this church and someone has just become a mom.
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:33.220]   I think we all know how difficult the first year of being a mom is.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.220]   We want to honor you.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:40.620]   It's great that we've got Isabella here and we're just so grateful for the gift.
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:46.500]   I think the day that Isabella was born, she caught COVID, right, basically?
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.500]   You caught it.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.500]   You caught it.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.500]   You caught it.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.500]   You were separated, right?
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.500]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:53.660]   I think she was separated.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:31:01.700]   I watched these feet as a sign that we really value you and we honor you.
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.180]   We treasure you as a mother.
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.140]   We treasure you as a minister.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:16.940]   We just want to say how proud we are of you, that you've become this mom.
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:29.820]   As we do this, Lord, may this just be reflecting your heart for Michelle and your heart for
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:34.700]   all the mothers of this church.
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:39.460]   We thank you, Lord, for what you've done.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:41.180]   Amen.
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:45.580]   This is very hard for me, but that's good.
[00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.940]   Yeah, please do that.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:51.180]   You can stay there.
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.180]   Yeah.
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:32:02.300]   It's not the first time, actually, but actually, I just want to say I admire her nail varnish.
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:03.300]   It's great nail varnish.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:12.540]   And Sandra, you've not only been a mom to two boys and a grandma to five, you're a mom
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:18.620]   to many here in Hong Kong, in this church, and around the world.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.940]   And I just want to say I want to bless you.
[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:28.420]   I want to bless you as a mother, as a grandmother.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:32.580]   And most of all, you've been a mother to this big kid as well.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.020]   You've been a mother to me.
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:39.940]   And thank you for your years of service, devoted service.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.240]   You are a selfless person.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.620]   You've given of yourself for other people.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.140]   You were the one I was thinking of with the four pieces of pie.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:48.140]   You would have done that.
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.300]   Definitely would have done that.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:57.580]   And as a church, we really want to just honor you as a mother, as a grandmother, as a mother
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:02.180]   to the city, and a mother to the nations.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.780]   And I just thank God for you.
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.020]   And we bless you.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.540]   In Jesus' name.
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:09.540]   Amen.
[00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:13.620]   Let's give a round of applause.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.620]   Good.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:19.620]   You can go back to your seat.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:32.100]   I'm just going to pray a prayer, and then I'm going to ask mothers to stand.
[00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.700]   Could you just stay there for a moment?
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.700]   I'm just going to pray.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.700]   Lord, we thank you for your service to us.
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:52.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.700]   We thank you for your service to us.
