[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.000]   He gives a great sermon on Ephesus
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.080]   and they were doing church the right way,
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.040]   but they didn't have the right heart.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.680]   They didn't love with the first love of Jesus.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.200]   And today we're talking about Smyrna.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.520]   Has anybody been to Smyrna before?
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.520]   It is near Ephesus, actually.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.040]   It is only 80 kilometers north of Ephesus.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.240]   It was known for its architecture.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.100]   It was known as a rich city.
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.360]   It was known as a seaport.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.360]   As you see here, it's very close to Athens and Rome.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.080]   It was known as a seaport.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.960]   It was also known, according to some of the research
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.960]   that I went into, it was known for myrrh.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.840]   So you hear Smyrna, myrrh.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.200]   And do you guys know what myrrh is?
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.920]   Anybody dressed in myrrh today?
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.960]   No? Okay.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.840]   Myrrh was used as perfume
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.560]   and also more commonly used as embodiment, right?
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.080]   And so in Egypt, they have mummies
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.760]   and they used myrrh a lot.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.760]   Possibly myrrh that was used for Jesus came from Smyrna.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.400]   We don't know exactly,
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.040]   but possibly that was one of the trades,
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.800]   major trades that they had.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.640]   And Smyrna, we will begin this letter in verse eight.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.760]   So the angel of the church in Smyrna write,
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.120]   "These are the words of him who is the first and the last,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.540]   "who died and came to life again.
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.320]   "I know your afflictions and your poverty,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.800]   "yet you are rich.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.680]   "I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.620]   "and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
[00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.360]   "Be not afraid of what you are about to suffer.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.320]   "I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.220]   "to test you and you will suffer persecution for 10 days.
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.080]   "Be faithful, even to the point of death.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.080]   "And I will give you life as your victor's crown.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.060]   "Whoever has ears, let them hear what the Spirit says
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.800]   "to the churches.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.220]   "The one who is victorious will not be hurt at all
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.320]   "by the second death."
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.860]   So we see here that in the first chapter of Revelations,
[00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.080]   Jesus introduces himself as the Alpha and the Omega.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.160]   And once again, he introduces himself here
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.160]   as the first and the last, the Alpha and the Omega.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.120]   The city of Smyrna was actually overtaken by a Lydian king.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.460]   And it was torn to pieces and it was only a village.
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.880]   But then Alexander the Great saw the city
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.840]   and he had a vision that this city would become great again.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.760]   And so Jesus might be playing on this death of the city
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.160]   and resurrection of the city.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.840]   And that's why he might be introducing himself
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.200]   once again and emphasizing that he is the Alpha
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.000]   and the Omega, the first and the last.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   And Jesus says that he knows, he knows.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.400]   Pastor James says last week, he reminded us,
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.240]   Jesus knew what was happening in the church of Ephesus.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.200]   And he also knows what is happening in Smyrna here.
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.500]   And he says, "I see three challenges.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.400]   I see your afflictions.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.600]   I see three challenges that you are going through
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.720]   and that you are about to go through."
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.760]   And these are the three challenges, the three Ps,
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   poverty, persecution, and prison or imprisonment.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.440]   And the first thing he says in verse nine is,
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.760]   "I know your afflictions and your poverty.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.000]   I know your poverty."
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.440]   Why were they poor?
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.880]   Why were they poor?
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.280]   What was the religious dominance of that time in that city?
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.900]   That city, just like Ephesus,
[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.800]   was filled with all sorts of gods, right?
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.100]   Gods to Athena and Apollos
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.160]   and all those other Greek sort of gods.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.540]   It was full of those temples in that city.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.140]   And so if you followed Jesus Christ
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.680]   and you were a Christian,
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.380]   possibly you couldn't get a job in that city.
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.880]   You couldn't get a job.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.020]   And if you were in charge of trade,
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.940]   you were trying to trade something,
[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.780]   and they were like,
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.780]   "Oh, has your product been blessed by Apollos or Athena
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.380]   or one of these gods?"
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.940]   And, "No, no, these products have been blessed by God."
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.780]   They would be like, "Why would I trade with you?
[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.940]   Why would I trade with you?"
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.020]   And so these Christians were facing poverty.
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.740]   They were poor because they were Christian,
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.320]   because of their belief in Jesus Christ.
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.840]   They possibly could not get a job because of their faith.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.040]   And also their trade was being affected.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.440]   You know, I went to India several years ago.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.180]   I've been to India a couple of times.
[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.380]   And as I went to India
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.380]   and got in touch with some of the Christians
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.220]   that were there,
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.380]   did you know that in India,
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.940]   you have to place,
[00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.980]   like some other countries around the world,
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.380]   you have to place your religious status on your passport.
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.340]   You have to claim whether you're Hindu or a Christian
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.880]   or Catholic or...
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.520]   And because some of these people came in India,
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.120]   came to know Jesus,
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.180]   they decided to change their passport
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.680]   from Hindu to Christian.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.680]   And some of them came from Hindu families.
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.520]   How do you think their families would take that?
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.020]   That they would change on their official status,
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.920]   that they've changed their religion?
[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.160]   And some of them could not get a job
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.060]   because they were no longer Hindus.
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.760]   They were following Christ.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.100]   I had dinner recently with a church member of mine
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.060]   from Toronto,
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.660]   who now works in Hong Kong.
[00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:57.020]   And she manages several portfolios for the company.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.960]   And she would go out and meet other companies.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.620]   And she's in charge of different trade deals
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.300]   or manufacturing deals.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.200]   And a lot of them would go under the table and be like,
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   "Hey, if you set up this deal between my company and yours,
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:22.540]   I'll give you something under the table, tax-free,
[00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.440]   so you can be rich."
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.340]   So that, it's a win-win, right?
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.500]   Your company wins, I win,
[00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.700]   and most importantly, you win as well.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.280]   And she said a lot of people in her position
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.440]   already would be super rich, super rich.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.940]   But she has made an oath
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.340]   because of her belief in Jesus Christ,
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.340]   she would not take some of these bribes.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:54.000]   She's willing to stand for her faith.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.240]   She might've lost monetarily on some of these things,
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.340]   but yet she has chosen to obey Christ.
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.740]   And Jesus says to this church,
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.640]   and also to her, I believe,
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.500]   that you are rich, maybe not in terms of monetary,
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.740]   but you are rich in faith.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.200]   You're rich in obeying God.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.380]   You're rich in spiritual gifts and spiritual treasures.
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.580]   'Cause where your heart is, your treasure is also.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.280]   And Jesus is saying here
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.820]   that you might not have gotten that job,
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.680]   might not have gotten that trade deal,
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.580]   but you are rich because your treasure is in heaven.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:47.140]   Your treasure comes from the Lord.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.720]   And so this was the first affliction,
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.540]   first tribulation that this church went through,
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.780]   that they were poor monetarily,
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.740]   but yet a rich church, a rich church.
[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.420]   The second thing that they went through is persecution.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.940]   And we see that in verse nine.
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.420]   I know about the slander of those who say
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.740]   they are Jews and are not,
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.220]   but are a synagogue of heaven.
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.180]   Oh, sorry, synagogue of Satan.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:23.140]   The Jews back then had special entitlement
[00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.540]   to not have to worship the Roman gods.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:32.840]   The Jews had the God of Israel, right?
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.340]   They had special privilege to not have to worship
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.620]   the Roman gods and they could just worship their own God,
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:42.820]   the God of Israel.
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.820]   And they had that privilege.
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.820]   However, the Christians threatened this entitlement.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.420]   This entitlement because of several things.
[00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:00.420]   The first was an accusation of cannibalism.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.060]   Okay, so they had communion, right?
[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.900]   And so apparently they were eating the body of Christ
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.380]   and drinking the blood of Christ.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.380]   And Jews were like these Christians, they're cannibalists.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.060]   They're practicing cannibalism.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.220]   How could they, right?
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.100]   And so they would complain maybe to the Roman authorities
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:31.100]   and they would exercise those who were Christians
[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.200]   because of what they were doing.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.400]   The second thing is these Christians would call each other,
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.060]   what do you guys call each other?
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:42.780]   Brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.520]   And the Romans had a very specific family system.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.620]   They had a very specific citizen and slave system.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:57.220]   And so for them to call each other just brothers and sisters
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.780]   and accept everyone into this family,
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.060]   it was as if they were going against
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.740]   the Roman family system.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:11.340]   And so these Christian Jews were not accepted
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.080]   by their own people.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:18.080]   They were not accepted by their own people
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.920]   because of their faith and devotion to Jesus Christ.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:30.740]   Have you ever been challenged to believe Jesus Christ
[00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:36.140]   in the midst of people not accepting you?
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:43.760]   My father, he was the first person
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:49.060]   to be a Christian in his family.
[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.880]   And he came to know Jesus because he went to a Christian,
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.280]   a Christian school in Hong Kong.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.380]   And then, hi dad, by the way.
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.760]   He's always listening.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.680]   He had a scare.
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.400]   The first scare was that Bruce Lee died, right?
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.880]   Bruce Lee, how could Bruce Lee die of cancer?
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.440]   He looks like he's invincible in these Hong Kong movies.
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.440]   And then the second scare that he had,
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.720]   he had this sort of, yeah,
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.840]   some sort of tumor on his hand, on his wrist.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.280]   And he was very scared that he himself
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.040]   possibly had a tumor and had cancer.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.320]   And those two things led him to Jesus Christ.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.480]   And my dad is a very intellectual, brilliant person.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:46.040]   And he had inspiration, inspiration to become a doctor,
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.720]   to be an engineer, all those Asian jobs, right?
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:57.960]   And so when he told my grandparents, his parents,
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.200]   that he was gonna go to seminary,
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.900]   my dad threatened to kick him out of the house.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:10.160]   My grandma was on her knees begging,
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.000]   Don't go, don't go.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   And yet my dad chose to follow Jesus Christ.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.160]   And he became the first in his family to know Jesus Christ.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:34.600]   And his obedience to Christ is a big reason
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.360]   why I choose to follow Jesus Christ.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.640]   Are we willing to follow Jesus Christ
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.880]   in the midst of persecution
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.640]   when the people around us do not accept us?
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.860]   Maybe our own families do not accept us.
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:56.080]   Are we willing to follow Jesus Christ?
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.280]   My dad did.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:05.480]   And years later, when my grandparents came to Canada,
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.460]   they came to our church.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:14.280]   And eventually, they gave their lives to Jesus Christ.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.200]   And so my grandparents, who are no longer with us,
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.760]   they are with the Lord in paradise.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.320]   And I hope to see them once again.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.880]   And I know I will see them once again, not I hope.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.740]   I will see them.
[00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.360]   I will.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.420]   I will see them.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.680]   Poverty, persecution.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.300]   And the last thing is the threat of prison.
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:50.320]   Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.240]   I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:58.240]   to test you, and you will suffer persecution for 10 days.
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.380]   Prison.
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.640]   You know, prison nowadays,
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:12.440]   it might not be as bad as back then, all right?
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.360]   Back then, the Roman prisons were probably rat infested,
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:21.400]   feces everywhere, right?
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.260]   Little light, little food.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:31.380]   Prison was not really a place that you would just be there
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.260]   for a short period of time.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.980]   Prison was basically, you were gonna go to trial
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.740]   and possibly execution, right?
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.020]   It was a short-term stay.
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.580]   It wasn't like nowadays, you can be in prison for 10 years
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.340]   and survive and have some sort of survival.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.900]   A lot of times, the Christians or the people
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.500]   that were in prison were later sent to the Colosseums
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.260]   where they would be eaten by animals
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.400]   in these war festivities.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:10.660]   Prison was what Jesus said that they would face,
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.480]   that they would suffer.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.040]   The devil would put some of you in prison
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.000]   because of your faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.820]   And it says here that you will suffer persecution
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.680]   for 10 days.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.920]   Now, we don't know exactly what these 10 days means, right?
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.040]   It could literally mean 10 days.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.040]   Some theologians think it could be a period,
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.220]   10-year period.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:42.480]   Some thought, oh, it was following the Roman Caesars.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.800]   There were 10 Caesars.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.320]   It could possibly be those 10 Caesars.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.880]   You're gonna suffer through those 10 Caesars.
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.860]   We don't know exactly.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.520]   But they were gonna suffer persecution.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.260]   And one of the people that suffered persecution
[00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:01.820]   was a pastor there called Polycarp.
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.940]   You guys heard of Polycarp?
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.940]   And he existed there from 69 to 156, 69 to 156.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:16.300]   All right, Jesus died around 33 AD,
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:21.300]   so a period after Jesus where the church had been built up.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.700]   And the story is this,
[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:30.200]   that imperial worship became more and more prevalent
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.560]   in that city, right?
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.980]   So not only just worshiping the Roman gods,
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.740]   but worshiping Caesar, right?
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.880]   And so there was sort of this ritual
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.200]   that you would have to pay tribute to Caesar once a year.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.780]   You would have to claim Caesar as God,
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:51.220]   give him incense, and then you could be off in your way.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:58.100]   And the Christians at that time were not willing to do that.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.940]   And Polycarp himself was not willing to do that.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:07.020]   And so the Roman officials sent guards towards him
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.900]   to arrest him.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.300]   And he was an old man by then.
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:13.220]   He had served the Lord faithfully.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.360]   And he offered food to the guards
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.420]   and, you know, hope you guys are okay.
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:24.160]   And these guards start to feel sorry.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.400]   This is an old man.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.360]   We really have to take him to the officials.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.720]   But eventually they wanted to do their job.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.480]   And so they took Polycarp towards the authorities
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.720]   and the officials there.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.420]   And the officials said, "Polycarp, are you going
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:48.060]   to claim Caesar as God?"
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:53.080]   And he said these famous words,
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.460]   "Eighty and six years have I served Christ,
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.700]   nor has he ever done me any harm.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:05.620]   How then can I blaspheme my King who saved me?
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.020]   I bless thee
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.100]   for
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:18.540]   fordeigning me worthy of this day and this hour
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.620]   that I may be among thy martyrs
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.340]   and drink the cup of my Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.700]   His famous words.
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.420]   "Eighty and six years have I served.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.420]   How could I blaspheme my King who has saved me?"
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.720]   So usually they would be nailed to a stake and burned.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.980]   Polycarp was like, "You don't need to nail me.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.160]   Just tie my hands. I will stand there.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.320]   I will not flee."
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.120]   And he stood there and they lit up,
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:57.840]   as you can see in the next slide,
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.700]   lit up a fire underneath him.
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:07.380]   And some witnesses said in history
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.420]   that this flame did not engulf him.
[00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.740]   It burned, but it did not engulf him.
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.120]   Just like Daniel and Daniel's friends
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:18.960]   when he was challenged by Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.380]   The flame did not burn him.
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.400]   It was a miracle.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.320]   And then a soldier who was nearby,
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.880]   you see the soldier right there,
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.240]   he took his spear and stabbed him.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   And that is how he gave his life to Christ as a martyr.
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:41.020]   He gave his life to Christ just as Jesus said
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:46.300]   that some of you would be put in prison.
[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.620]   Some of you would suffer and he did.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.180]   And we see this church here,
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.580]   the three challenges that they went through.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.380]   The first challenge was poverty.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.380]   All right, they were rejected by the Romans.
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.540]   The people around them did not offer them jobs.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.740]   They would not trade with them.
[00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.380]   They dealt with persecution,
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.140]   rejected by the Jews, their own people.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.020]   These people, they're cannibals.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.020]   These people, they're going against the Roman systems.
[00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:25.660]   The challenge of prison,
[00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.740]   they were rejected by the authorities
[00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.300]   who said you need to pay tribute to Caesar as God.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:39.640]   And yet they stayed faithful.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:45.280]   Jesus says they were experiencing poverty,
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:51.100]   yet they are rich because their treasure is in heaven.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.700]   They were being persecuted by their own people,
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:58.700]   yet Jesus Christ accepts them into the family of Christ.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.840]   We sang, we are a child of God.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.400]   And they faced imprisonment,
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:12.360]   yet they were free in Jesus Christ.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:18.760]   They were rich, accepted and free.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.780]   What an amazing church.
[00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.980]   And I hope that is our church,
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.380]   that we would be rich in Christ,
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.260]   be a church that is a family of God,
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.180]   accepted by Christ as children of God.
[00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.940]   And we are free in Christ
[00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.760]   to go and proclaim his message wherever he calls us to.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:47.060]   The Roman authorities could not hold this church,
[00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:48.080]   imprison them.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.500]   And I hope that we, no matter who is going against us,
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.500]   that we would boldly proclaim the message of Christ,
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.740]   the gospel of Christ,
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:05.620]   rich, accepted and free.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.140]   Amazing.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.380]   And Jesus says this to finish off his letter to Smyrna,
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.180]   "Be faithful even to the point of death,
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.620]   and I will give you life as your victor's crown.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.140]   Whoever has ears,
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.580]   let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.300]   The one who is victorious
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.760]   will not be hurt at all by the second death."
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.260]   Jesus says, "Be faithful.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.840]   I will give you life as a victor's crown."
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.920]   Now, who wears crowns?
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.740]   Who wears crowns?
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.820]   Royalty, right?
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:50.200]   The Queen of England, right?
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.360]   Back then, who else wore crowns?
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.560]   A victor's crown.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.640]   Those who competed
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:04.320]   in the games.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:10.400]   The winners would get the victor's crown.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:16.320]   And these Christians in Smyrna,
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.640]   nobody thought they were royalty.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.960]   Nobody thought they were winning.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   They were poor.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.240]   They were outcasted.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:30.960]   But in Jesus' eyes, they were winners.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.800]   They deserved a crown,
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.920]   a victor's crown,
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.760]   because of their faithfulness to Jesus.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.240]   And Jesus here is saying,
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.720]   "Be faithful to the point of death,
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:51.720]   and I will give you life as a victor's crown."
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:58.720]   And so the message for the Church of Smyrna
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:02.080]   2,000 years ago,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.880]   it's also a message to us.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:11.680]   Are we willing to follow Jesus?
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.200]   Are you willing to follow Jesus
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.640]   in the midst of hardship,
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.760]   in the midst of poverty,
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.840]   in the face of poverty?
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.080]   Are we willing to follow Jesus?
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:30.760]   When there's temptations to take bribes,
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   just like my friend from Toronto, who now works here,
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.920]   are we willing to follow Jesus, stand for Jesus?
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:47.520]   In the midst of being outcasted and persecution,
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.360]   are we willing to follow Jesus?
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:57.880]   My dad was facing persecution from his own father.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.960]   If you go to seminary, I will kick you out of the house.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.440]   But he was willing to obey Christ.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.640]   And we see the fruit of his labor.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:19.840]   Are we willing to go to the ends of the earth
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.200]   to share the love of Christ?
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.760]   There will be trials and tribulations.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.120]   Jesus tells us that.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:36.040]   If they persecuted me, will they not persecute you?
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:40.840]   Following Christ will not always be easy,
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.520]   but it will be worth it.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:49.560]   Because where our treasure is, our heart is also.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.400]   Will you choose victory in Christ
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:57.520]   or will you choose to be a victim?
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:03.720]   Oh, I feel sorry for myself.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.280]   I'm a victim, you know.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.440]   Or will we claim victory in Christ
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.960]   who has died and resurrected from death
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.080]   so that we could have a relationship with him?
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:20.560]   I'm gonna invite the praise team to come up
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.360]   as we close in prayer.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:28.400]   Heavenly Father, we come before you.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.200]   We thank you for what you have done on the cross.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.320]   You have purchased for us a place in heaven.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.160]   You have restored for us a relationship with you
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.800]   that was once lost.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.480]   And Heavenly Father, I pray that you would help us
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.320]   in our situation, whatever we're facing,
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.720]   to be faithful to you,
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.280]   whether in our jobs, whether in our family,
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.800]   in whatever circumstances.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.200]   Maybe we're being outcasted as a Christian.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.640]   Oh, you Christian.
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:03.960]   They say at school or at work or wherever,
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.120]   but we would stand firm
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.560]   because your spirit gives us strength.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:14.800]   Help us, Lord, in our weakness
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:19.040]   to be faithful to you,
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.080]   that we would one day go to heaven
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:29.800]   and you would say, "Good and faithful servant."
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.200]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:33.700]   Amen.
