1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
 It's so good to see you human beings!

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,160
 Isn't it good to be together again?

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,360
 Actually, you know what, who are we kidding?

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,360
 We've had people on the MTR for a good few weeks now.

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,760
 Has it surprised you when you suddenly see all these people on the MTR again?

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,840
 It's kind of like moving to Hong Kong all over again.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,200
 And I was like, "Whoa, social distancing, bro!"

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,000
 But it's really good. It's really good to be here to see everyone.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,840
 I pray that you've all been well.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,640
 Last week, Pastor John started us on a new series called "Dear Church."

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,440
 "Dear Church," looking at the book of Revelation.

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,960
 And today I get the honour of going through the first letter

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,160
 that Jesus writes to the first church He wants to talk about.

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,440
 The book of Revelation really is the revelation of Jesus Christ.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,840
 You see, I can't do it. OK.

16
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,960
 Let's just move this aside.

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,240
 The revelation of Jesus Christ to the Apostle John.

18
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,240
 To us.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,040
 You know, the whole book, the whole Bible is basically pointing towards what?

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,760
 Pointing towards Jesus.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,560
 Jesus is central to God's rescue plan for us.

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,840
 And we see here now in Revelation, is Jesus revealing Himself.

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,240
 And it looks nothing like we expected.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,560
 Jesus looks nothing like we expected or had prepared ourselves for.

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,160
 In fact, we sang a little about it.

26
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,440
 That He will return.

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,640
 And it looks very different.

28
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,840
 And if you look at Revelation 1, you'll see a very, very different Jesus

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,360
 to the lovey-dovey, teddy bear Jesus that accepts us and forgives us.

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,360
 And so we now start in Revelation 2, and He writes to a church in Ephesus.

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,040
 Ephesus is an interesting city.

32
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,840
 It's described as Asia's supreme metropolis.

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,240
 It wasn't the official capital, that was Pergamum.

34
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,760
 But in some ways, Ephesus was the economic, political and spiritual capital.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,760
 Maybe very similar to New York.

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,160
 Everything was there. Everyone was there.

37
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,560
 Every business was there. All the money was there.

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,960
 All the religions were there.

39
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,560
 In fact, the main, the chief cult that was there

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,960
 was a cult that worshipped the goddess Artemis.

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,360
 And so John writes and receives this vision from Jesus

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,360
 to tell to the church of Ephesus.

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
 And as we look through this letter,

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,760
 as we look through all the letters in the next few weeks,

45
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,560
 what I want us to do is, as we look at what Jesus says about this church,

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,760
 is ask ourselves, "Is that us?"

47
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,960
 Can we see any of this in us?

48
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,160
 And then what are we supposed to do about it?

49
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,960
 Jesus, as He goes through these different churches,

50
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,960
 He gives what, in England, we would call good constructive feedback.

51
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,960
 It's called a poo sandwich, where He starts off with something good,

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,360
 then He moves into something less good,

53
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,160
 and then He finishes off with a bit of encouragement at the end.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,560
 And as we look at this constructive feedback that Jesus gives these churches,

55
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,760
 I ask you to look into your own heart.

56
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,960
 I look into my own heart.

57
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,560
 And we, as a church, ask, "Is Jesus saying this to us right now?"

58
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,160
 And so this is the first one.

59
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,960
 And we're going to look at it.

60
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,760
 And you can turn there.

61
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
 Actually, we've got it on the screen.

62
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,760
 And it's Revelation 2, verse 1-7.

63
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,760
 And I want to go through each verse.

64
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,160
 I haven't got three points today.

65
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,760
 We've got seven verses, so we're just going to go through it one by one.

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,360
 Okay?

67
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,960
 So the first verse is this, and I'll read it to you.

68
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,360
 And it says this, Chapter 2, verse 1.

69
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,760
 "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write,

70
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,960
 'The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand,

71
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,360
 who walks among the seven golden lampstands.'"

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,160
 So Jesus reveals to John in a vision, and He tells him to write this down.

73
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,760
 And He sends a message to the angel of the church in Ephesus.

74
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,160
 And He says, "The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand."

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,360
 What are the seven stars?

76
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,960
 If you look at the end of Chapter 1, you'll see, verse 20,

77
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,560
 "As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand,

78
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,960
 and the seven golden lampstands,

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,560
 the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches,

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
 and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."

81
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,960
 So He's holding the angels, and then, here's the key sentence,

82
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,160
 He walks among the seven golden lampstands.

83
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,360
 This is my first observation.

84
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,560
 Jesus walks amongst the church.

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
 Jesus knows the church.

86
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,560
 He writes to the church and calls the church by name.

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,360
 And He knows the church, and later we'll see, He knows the works of the church.

88
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,760
 He knows all these different things.

89
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,760
 And the first observation is that Jesus knows the church.

90
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,760
 Jesus knows us.

91
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,160
 I want to ask you, how do you feel if I told you that Jesus knows you,

92
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,560
 and is walking amongst you?

93
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,960
 How would you feel if Jesus was sat right here?

94
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,560
 Can you just pause for a moment and just imagine

95
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,560
 if Jesus Christ Himself was sat on this chair?

96
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,560
 How would you feel?

97
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,560
 What would you be thinking?

98
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,360
 What would you think about that you've done this last week?

99
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,560
 What would you be thinking about what you need to address and do now?

100
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,960
 You see, Christine and I, we entered into full-time ministry a good few years ago,

101
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,560
 and we dedicated our lives to spending our time to talking about Jesus,

102
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,960
 to doing work for Jesus, to serving Jesus.

103
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,760
 You know, I'll confess to you, sometimes I forget that He's next to me.

104
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,960
 I forget that He's walking beside me.

105
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,360
 I fail to acknowledge His presence, His existence in my life.

106
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,560
 How about you?

107
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,560
 For those of us who have grown up in the church,

108
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,160
 who know all this stuff, who know how to talk about Jesus,

109
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,560
 who know how to serve Jesus and do all these things,

110
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,360
 how aware are we of Jesus' presence in our lives?

111
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,960
 KFCI, how aware are we that Jesus is walking amongst us?

112
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,160
 Who walks among the seven golden lampstands?

113
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,560
 He's actually walking with us.

114
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,960
 He is here right now, and He knows us.

115
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,960
 I don't know about you, that gives me a little bit of an uneasy feeling.

116
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
 Because Jesus is actually right here.

117
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,560
 He's actually seeing what I'm doing.

118
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,160
 He actually knows what I'm thinking.

119
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,760
 He actually knows, He can see how I'm treating other people.

120
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,960
 Jesus knows us.

121
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
 Jesus is walking amongst the church.

122
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,560
 Verse 2.

123
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,160
 "I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance,

124
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,960
 and how you cannot bear with those who are evil,

125
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,760
 but have tested those who call themselves apostles and none are,

126
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,160
 and found them to be false."

127
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,760
 This is the model church that we in Hong Kong revere.

128
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,160
 A church, Jesus says here, "Hey, I know your works.

129
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,360
 I know your good works.

130
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,960
 You guys do good stuff.

131
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,560
 You do good Bible studies.

132
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,960
 You do good prayer groups.

133
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,760
 You do good outreach.

134
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,960
 You do good 101s and 102s and 103s.

135
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,960
 You do good things.

136
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,160
 I see that.

137
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,760
 I see you, church.

138
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,960
 You are good."

139
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,560
 Then He says, "I know your toil.

140
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,760
 I know it's not easy.

141
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,360
 I know that you guys are diligent.

142
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,760
 You are hard workers.

143
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,960
 Things are not easy outside.

144
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,760
 What was not easy?

145
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,960
 The church in Ephesus was stuck between two big, big powers,

146
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,760
 the Roman Empire and the temple.

147
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,160
 And it was hard, but still they were doing good work.

148
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,360
 They were hard workers.

149
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,360
 Does this sound familiar?

150
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,560
 Does this sound like a church that we here in Hong Kong strive to be?

151
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,560
 That we do lots of good stuff, that we work hard?

152
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,960
 Isn't it natural to us that that's what we do?

153
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,160
 And so Jesus is saying to this church in Ephesus,

154
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
 "I see you.

155
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
 I see you're doing these things.

156
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
 What else do I see?

157
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,760
 And your patient endurance."

158
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,160
 As I said, it wasn't easy at that time.

159
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,360
 The patient endurance really represents a persistence in faith.

160
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,160
 So this church had gone on for a couple of generations now.

161
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,360
 The early church fathers, the ones who maybe spent time with Jesus himself,

162
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,560
 or spent time with Paul, they had now gone.

163
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,960
 And now the church was filled with people, their children,

164
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,360
 their children's children, their children's children's friends,

165
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,960
 and all the people had just joined the faith.

166
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,760
 And things were not easy.

167
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,360
 In fact, they were very hard.

168
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,160
 But yet they showed patient endurance.

169
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,160
 That meant that even in the midst of the tough times,

170
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,160
 even in the midst of not seeing where the hope was,

171
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,360
 where the future was, they were still committed.

172
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,960
 And Jesus saw that.

173
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
 So this was a resilient group.

174
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,160
 This, right now so far, is a good church.

175
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,960
 Right?

176
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,760
 It's a good church.

177
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,360
 It's one that we all, in some ways, strive to be.

178
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,360
 And how you cannot bear with those who are evil.

179
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
 So not only was it hard working, not only did it have good programs,

180
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,560
 it also was committed to the truth.

181
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,960
 It wasn't compromised.

182
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,560
 Ephesus was full of different people, different distractions.

183
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,960
 And yet it remained true to the biblical truths.

184
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,360
 It stayed and it could not bear with those who were evil.

185
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,560
 It did not tolerate sin.

186
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,160
 And we'll find out later, there were groups of people within the church

187
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,960
 who did compromise,

188
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,160
 who started to take advantage of the newfound freedoms,

189
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,560
 who then started to basically twist the faith to serve themselves,

190
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,360
 to satisfy their own desires.

191
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,960
 Yet here we see the saying,

192
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,160
 "How you cannot bear with those who are evil.

193
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,960
 You did not tolerate sin and you stuck with the truth

194
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,560
 and you were committed to the truth."

195
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,760
 Still sounds good.

196
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,160
 Still sounds like an A+ kind of church.

197
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,760
 "But have tested those who call themselves apostles

198
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,560
 and are not and found them to be false."

199
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,160
 Here again, they are committed to the truth.

200
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
 They tested the false apostles.

201
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
 They tested false preaching.

202
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,560
 During that time, there were different groups.

203
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,960
 There were the Nicolaitans, which we'll read a little bit more later.

204
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,760
 There were the Gnostics,

205
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,360
 who were starting to kind of preach a twisted gospel,

206
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,760
 where if you got it, you got it.

207
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
 You're in the secret club.

208
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,960
 If you are elite, you will get it.

209
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
 And they were starting to twist the gospel.

210
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
 They would twist what the scripture was teaching.

211
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,960
 But these guys, the church in Ephesus remained true.

212
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
 They stayed and were committed to the truth.

213
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,360
 How did they test the apostles?

214
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,160
 That meant that one, they were knowledgeable in the word of God

215
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,760
 and that they were also tight-knit,

216
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
 that they would be in community.

217
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,360
 They would talk and pray and wrestle with

218
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,360
 the things that were out there,

219
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,760
 the distractions that were out there.

220
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,160
 And they would test them against the word of God.

221
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,560
 And they would see that those were false.

222
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,160
 They were committed to the truth.

223
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,560
 Still, what an admirable trait to have.

224
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,960
 What a great church to be a part of.

225
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,760
 And it carries on.

226
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,760
 "I know you are enduring patiently

227
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,560
 and bearing up for my name's sake,

228
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,160
 and you have not grown weary."

229
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
 Again, that patient endurance.

230
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,760
 Why? Because there was persecution.

231
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,160
 Brothers and sisters in the church were falling like flies.

232
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,960
 And yet they would still hold on, knowing that this was true.

233
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
 Can you imagine how much conviction

234
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,560
 they would have had to held to the truths in their heart

235
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,760
 when things weren't going well?

236
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,760
 See, they had this faith passed down to them

237
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,360
 from their fathers and from their forefathers.

238
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,360
 And yet here they were, clinging on to doing the right thing,

239
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,760
 running the right programs, and sticking true to the word,

240
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
 even when it did not serve them well.

241
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
 Even when it would have been easier just to tell the Romans,

242
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,960
 "You know what? It was all for a bit of fun.

243
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,960
 It was quite a good little thing. Don't worry about us.

244
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,760
 We're not going to threaten your power here."

245
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
 And just left it. They didn't.

246
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,760
 They held on to it. They were patiently enduring

247
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,160
 to the point where they did not grow weary.

248
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,160
 Did not grow weary. Are you weary?

249
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,360
 Let me tell you, I am weary.

250
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,960
 This last year has been quite a wearisome year.

251
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,360
 But it's interesting.

252
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,160
 When times are tough, when there is suffering,

253
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,360
 that's when our true convictions are revealed or exposed.

254
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
 I don't know about you.

255
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,560
 This last year for me, with all the tough things,

256
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,360
 and Christina and I, we realized that we're really not that good.

257
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,960
 That we really weren't that strong.

258
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,360
 That the things that we thought we put our faith in, we didn't.

259
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,360
 We keep saying we trust God, but actually,

260
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,360
 this last year has shown us every time there's an opportunity to be angry,

261
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,160
 every time there's an opportunity to be frustrated,

262
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,960
 we take the bait.

263
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
 And we realize we're not as strong as we were.

264
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,560
 That the truths that we said, that we declared, that we believed,

265
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,760
 we kind of believed.

266
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,960
 But when it came to it, when the going got tough,

267
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,160
 our inner self was exposed.

268
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,160
 What about you? Are you weary?

269
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
 See, it's interesting.

270
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
 During a time like this, these people here,

271
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,160
 they were going through persecution.

272
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,160
 They were getting hunted down, driven underground,

273
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,560
 yet they were patiently enduring.

274
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,760
 The persecution that we face now, if any,

275
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,560
 was nothing like what they faced here.

276
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,560
 Now, I don't know how you feel about the future of Hong Kong,

277
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,160
 and we're not going to talk too much about this,

278
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,960
 but what if there was one day that we were persecuted in the same way that this was?

279
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,160
 Where would you stand?

280
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,560
 How committed to truth are you?

281
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,160
 If it meant that it would cost you your life.

282
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,360
 If it meant it would cost me my life.

283
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,560
 How committed to truth are you?

284
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,760
 Are you as committed as these people here?

285
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,760
 This morning, I got sent an article from, written by, I think, Sydney Anglicans.

286
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,560
 And it was talking about how, you know,

287
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
 I won't name the country or the government here,

288
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,960
 but there's a country that has been tweaking and rewriting the Bible

289
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,760
 to serve its own purpose.

290
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,160
 Has been twisting certain stories so that when it's taught,

291
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,360
 it would basically serve the needs of that country instead.

292
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,160
 In some ways, that is a form of persecution that these guys faced.

293
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,160
 They were testing against false teaching.

294
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,360
 Now, and then I thought about this myself.

295
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
 We're lucky enough that we have the Bible in our hands,

296
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
 and we know that it's the true one.

297
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,960
 We have it on our phones. We have the ESV app. We have the Holy Bible app.

298
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,560
 What if that was taken away?

299
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,560
 What if we didn't have access to that anymore?

300
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,960
 I think then we would find out how grounded in truth our lives really are.

301
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,560
 So that when we look at stories that may be tweaked by mankind with selfish desires,

302
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,760
 we would be able to see it.

303
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,960
 We would be able to test it.

304
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,560
 And it convicted me.

305
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,960
 Because I think there'd be parts of the Bible, if someone tweets,

306
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,560
 I would have no idea that they tweaked it.

307
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
 Is that the same with you?

308
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,960
 But this church here, they were committed to the truth.

309
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,360
 This was a good church.

310
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,360
 And so persecution is a huge threat to the church right here and now.

311
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,960
 But there's something that's maybe even more threatening to the church.

312
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,160
 And I recently heard a speaker, an apologetic speaker, talk about this.

313
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,360
 That actually modernity is an even bigger threat to the church than persecution.

314
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,160
 What's modernity?

315
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,560
 It's what we have in this modern age right now.

316
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,560
 It's social media, it's consumerism, it's materialism.

317
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,560
 These things are even more threatening to the church right now.

318
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,560
 Why? Because it makes us think that all we have to do to get to heaven is turn up to church.

319
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,960
 It makes us think that none of our lives really have to change.

320
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,160
 As long as we turn up to church, we will get where we want to be.

321
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,160
 That we don't really need to live out our faith the rest of our lives.

322
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,560
 That we can still live comfortably.

323
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,160
 That we can still indulge in the desires of this world and still be okay.

324
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
 That we can have other gods around.

325
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
 We can have other idols.

326
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,960
 We can climb. We can have other ambitions.

327
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,360
 We don't need to fully follow Christ and that will be enough.

328
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,160
 You see, that is a much bigger threat to our church than persecution is right now.

329
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,360
 In fact, I think this year, of not having church taken away from us,

330
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,560
 really has forced us to evaluate what we place our faith in.

331
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,560
 What is the most important thing to us?

332
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,560
 I've been watching the NBA finals recently.

333
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,160
 My team is in the finals, which is why I'm talking about it.

334
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,960
 It's called the Los Angeles Lakers and their best player is LeBron James.

335
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,560
 And he's pitched up against his old coach and arch rival Pat Riley.

336
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,960
 And they both have a saying.

337
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,160
 I think LeBron got it from Pat Riley when he was being coached by him,

338
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,760
 which was "Keep the main thing the main thing."

339
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,560
 Keep the main thing the main thing.

340
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,760
 And I realise that's the same for us.

341
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,360
 When trials come, when suffering comes, do we even know what the main thing is?

342
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,160
 Do we know why we are here?

343
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,360
 Are we rooted in truth? Are we committed to Christ?

344
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,160
 Because when those trials come, that's what's going to be put to test.

345
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,560
 And this church passed.

346
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,760
 In the face of modernity, in the face of all the challenges that we face in this world right now,

347
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,560
 how are we doing?

348
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,960
 Are we committed to the truth?

349
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,760
 You see, the church, us, we have to be different to the people outside.

350
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,960
 We know the truth, so it must impact the way we live.

351
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,960
 So the way we love people, the way we work, the way we study,

352
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,160
 the way we interact, the way we do anything should be different because we know the truth.

353
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,560
 Because we've had the gospel planted in our hearts.

354
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,760
 We should be different.

355
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,560
 And there's another way we should be different.

356
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,560
 And that's what? In the way that we love.

357
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,960
 So not only should we be committed to truth like this church here, like this A+ church here,

358
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,760
 but we must also be different in the way we love.

359
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,960
 And that's where this church fails.

360
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,960
 And that's where Jesus has something to say against them.

361
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,560
 The next verse, verse 4.

362
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:52,360
 "But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first."

363
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,160
 This is the bad bit.

364
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,960
 "But I have this against you, this A+ church that has all these good works,

365
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,160
 that works hard, that patiently endures, that holds on to the truth, that tests false teaching.

366
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,960
 I have this against you. You have abandoned your first love."

367
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,760
 Wow.

368
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,160
 The main thing was not necessarily truth.

369
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,760
 The main thing was not necessarily works.

370
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,160
 The main thing was love.

371
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
 And you abandoned it.

372
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,760
 And abandoned is a strong word.

373
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,160
 Another version uses forsaken.

374
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,760
 You've left behind. You've ran away from it.

375
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,560
 "I have this against you. You have abandoned your first love."

376
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,760
 Have any of us here abandoned our first love?

377
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,360
 Pastor John talked a bit about this earlier.

378
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,760
 Do you remember the time when you first encountered Christ?

379
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,360
 When you first fell in love with Jesus?

380
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,160
 How did it make you feel?

381
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,560
 What did it make you do?

382
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,960
 How did it change your life?

383
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,760
 Are you still there right now?

384
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,160
 It's hard, right?

385
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
 It's hard to keep that kind of thing going.

386
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,160
 In some ways it's the same as relationships, the same as married life.

387
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,360
 Alex and Kara, you got married recently, so maybe that first love is still fully there.

388
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,960
 This month, it's Christina and I's 10 year anniversary.

389
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,760
 This month.

390
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,160
 Oh, thank you. That's good. Thank you.

391
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,560
 I was going to take her around the world and do everything and splash out.

392
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:37,360
 But because of COVID, we're going to go to Mong Kok.

393
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,960
 And Christina will tell you, actually we've been married for 10 years, but we've been dating for 20.

394
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:50,360
 And I remember in the early days where you'd receive a letter or you'd get an SMS or even better, you get an ICQ.

395
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:56,160
 Oh, only old people will recognize that one.

396
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,560
 I said, oh, she messaged me.

397
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,160
 Oh, she put an X at the end of the message.

398
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,360
 Two X's. Capital X. She misses me.

399
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,960
 I'm going to see her again.

400
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,560
 And now it's like, oh, you again.

401
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,360
 Why are you still here? Don't you have some place to be?

402
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,360
 And many of you here are married for even longer.

403
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,160
 And you will know that to even maintain that kind of enthusiasm and that passion, it takes work.

404
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:35,560
 And if you're not careful, if you abandon that first love, if you forget why you were here in the first place, you run into some problems.

405
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,160
 How did Jesus know that they had abandoned their first love?

406
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,960
 You see, it's quite a hard thing to judge, right?

407
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,560
 How did he know that they'd abandoned their first love?

408
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,760
 They were doing good works. They were doing good Bible studies.

409
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,360
 They were going to BSF. They were running outreach programs.

410
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,760
 They were doing all the right things.

411
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,360
 How did he know that they had abandoned their first love?

412
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:05,560
 A lot of commentators would say that the way he knew, or the way that they had lost their first love was because they stopped loving each other.

413
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,760
 That was it.

414
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,160
 You see, loving God and loving people comes hand in hand.

415
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:15,760
 If you realize that you're not loving people as much as probably because you've stopped loving God,

416
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,360
 that they are so close and intertwined together.

417
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,960
 And if you love God, you can't help but love people.

418
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,960
 And actually, the Apostle Paul, when he writes to this church in Ephesus in the book of Ephesians, chapter 1, verse 15,

419
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,160
 he gives thanks for the love that they had for each other.

420
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,560
 And now we see how far they have fallen. They have forgotten their first love.

421
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,960
 They have abandoned their first love.

422
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,560
 It's down to us to not abandon our first love.

423
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,760
 Another question.

424
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,960
 So that's how Jesus knew that they had abandoned their first love, because they'd stopped loving each other.

425
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,160
 But why did they stop loving each other?

426
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,760
 How did that happen?

427
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,960
 How do we stop loving each other?

428
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,760
 My guess is pride.

429
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,360
 You see, it's really interesting.

430
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:11,760
 When you first meet Jesus, you encounter His holiness and His purity and also His love.

431
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:20,360
 And you also are reminded and shown your own depravity, your own weakness, the depth of your sin.

432
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:27,160
 Peter, when he first meets Jesus, goes down on his knees and says, "Depart from me, Lord, because I am a sinner."

433
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
 And so maybe it's the same for you.

434
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:35,160
 When you first met Jesus, you realised the depth of your sin.

435
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:42,160
 And it's only when you realise the depth of your sin do you get to appreciate the depth of His love.

436
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,960
 Because unless you know where you've gone wrong, you won't know how good He is to you.

437
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:55,560
 It's very hard to sing, "How great is your love" or "How great are you, God," if you think you're quite great yourself.

438
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,760
 So then what we have here is then pride.

439
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,760
 And why do I know that?

440
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,960
 They are so committed to all the other things.

441
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,360
 They are so committed to knowledge, to truth.

442
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
 But maybe that's where the problem lies.

443
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
 Because you see, you remember from the beginning.

444
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
 You first meet Jesus and you realise and you're on the ground.

445
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,160
 And you just don't actually...

446
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:16,560
 The apostle John here at the very beginning, chapter 1, verse 17,

447
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,160
 "When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead."

448
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:25,360
 That's the first exposure, that's the first encounter to the holiness of God.

449
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,560
 But then you realise, "Oh my goodness, He loves me.

450
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,760
 I'm allowed to be here."

451
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:39,960
 And that gratefulness, that release, that you're forgiven, suddenly just completely opens up a whole new world.

452
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,560
 And yet the problem is then, after that, you start committing to good things.

453
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,760
 "Oh, you know what? Now I'm saved by Jesus. I'm going to start going to church.

454
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,360
 I'm going to start going to clan. I'm going to start going to BSF."

455
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,560
 And suddenly what happens? These are all good things, by the way.

456
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:59,360
 Slowly, you start to feel better about yourself, which in some ways is not a bad thing.

457
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,760
 But then as you accumulate more knowledge, you start thinking, "You know what? I'm not so bad myself.

458
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,560
 I'm pretty good. I'm a decent person."

459
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:12,560
 And whilst that in itself is not a terrible thing, the risk is you start thinking,

460
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,560
 "Hmm, maybe my debt for my sin isn't that much."

461
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:22,960
 And the problem then is that you start thinking, "Hmm, how much does God really need to love me?

462
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,560
 I'm pretty easy to love."

463
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,960
 And then you have this pride. And then suddenly you think, "Oh, look at them.

464
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,760
 Oh, you see, I'm so much better than them. I'm doing all these different things.

465
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,760
 I'm doing so many works. I'm toiling away. I am patiently enduring. And look at them."

466
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,160
 I think that's where the problem lies.

467
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,560
 As we go on this journey, as we accumulate more knowledge, as we go on this path, which are all good things,

468
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,760
 you see, the Paul talks about this, that knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.

469
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,560
 And so that's where this church has gone wrong.

470
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,960
 And I wonder whether it's where we have gone wrong.

471
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,160
 We have been so engrossed with living a Christian life, engrossed with learning Bible verses,

472
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:07,160
 engrossed with forming our views on predestination and eschatology,

473
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,960
 that we have not allowed the main thing to still be the main thing.

474
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,960
 Love is the main thing. And it's so important for us to remember that.

475
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,360
 So I wonder whether church, and actually for us in Hong Kong, for us as Chinese people, we love to learn.

476
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,560
 We love to accumulate knowledge. We love a good expository sermon.

477
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,360
 We love a good Bible study in Leviticus.

478
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,560
 But I wonder whether even though it is a good thing that we have put it as the very top thing,

479
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,360
 when the very, very top thing is to love.

480
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,160
 Jesus' final prayer before he leaves was that we would love each other.

481
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:54,160
 His final declaration was that you will be known as my disciples if you love each other.

482
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,960
 That is the key. And maybe that's where this church went wrong.

483
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,560
 And this is where, for me, I'm trying to remind myself, this is not where I go wrong.

484
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,960
 Let's carry on.

485
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,960
 Verse 5.

486
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,360
 So Jesus doesn't leave them there.

487
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,960
 So he gives them some good stuff, then he gives them the really bad stuff,

488
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,760
 and then he shows them how to address this.

489
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,360
 And he gives them three very simple points.

490
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,960
 He says, "Remember, repent, and do."

491
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,160
 Remember, repent, and do. What does remember mean?

492
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,160
 Remember means think back to when you first met me.

493
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,560
 Your first state, when you realised who you were, how lost you were, how you were in darkness.

494
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:41,560
 But I came to you. Remember that.

495
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,160
 Because when you remember that, you remember the depth of your sin.

496
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:48,760
 And then you will realise again the depth of my love.

497
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,760
 And then you will be compelled to love others.

498
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,560
 So remember. It's the same as married couples who have maybe lost our way.

499
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,160
 It's go back to why we got married in the first place.

500
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,760
 What was the thing that I loved about you the most?

501
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
 And so you remember that.

502
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,360
 For us as a church, we remember why we came to this church in the first place.

503
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,960
 What drew us here? Why did God call us here? What has he called us to do?

504
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,760
 Remember. To look back and remember.

505
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,760
 And to see how far we've fallen.

506
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,160
 And what's the second step? To repent.

507
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,960
 Repent is to turn away. To realise that you've taken the wrong way and turn away.

508
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,360
 Just like this church, they were all good things.

509
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,360
 And actually many, many things start with the right intentions.

510
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,360
 They start with love.

511
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,560
 The early church fathers, when they put these Bible studies and these services

512
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,760
 and these teachings and prayer groups in place,

513
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,360
 they were all done out of love.

514
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,760
 Because they loved Jesus and they loved each other.

515
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,760
 So they put these things in place so that they can show each other more love.

516
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,560
 Yet somewhere along the line, they took a wrong turn.

517
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:55,960
 And mankind has this uncanny ability to corrupt anything that starts with good intentions.

518
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,360
 That even though it was started right, somewhere along the line,

519
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,960
 whether it's ourselves or someone we pass it to, eventually we lose our way.

520
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,160
 And Jesus is saying, "Go back. Remember. Then repent. Turn around and head back that way."

521
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,560
 And what's the best thing to do after that? Is do.

522
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,960
 Do the things that you did at first.

523
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,360
 Married couples, start talking to each other again.

524
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,760
 Start asking each other questions about how their day has been.

525
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,360
 What kind of food they like the most. Or just anything new.

526
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,960
 Do those things. Go out on dates. Talk to each other. Spend time with each other.

527
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,760
 And do the things. Find new hobbies.

528
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,160
 As for the church, go back to the things that are the most important.

529
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,760
 What are the main things?

530
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,960
 How are the ways that you can show love? Go back to those things.

531
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,160
 Remember, repent and do.

532
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
 I think that's a message for us as well.

533
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,560
 Remember how you got here at the beginning.

534
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,360
 Remember the darkness where God plucked you out from.

535
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,760
 And then repent and realise that you've made a mistake.

536
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,360
 God is gracious like that. His mercy is on you every day.

537
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,360
 And then do. Live it out again.

538
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,560
 It's important to live it out because if not, the consequences are severe.

539
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,160
 What are the consequences? The end of that verse.

540
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:19,960
 If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place unless you repent.

541
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,760
 If you don't do these things, if you don't remember, repent and live it out,

542
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,560
 what will Jesus do? Remove the lampstand.

543
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,960
 All these churches that made it into the Bible,

544
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,160
 these seven churches that Jesus writes to, all the ones that Paul writes to,

545
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:40,160
 they made it into the Bible. These were good churches.

546
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,960
 I haven't been to Israel or to the Holy Land myself, but for those who have been,

547
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,760
 they tell me that if you go and visit these churches, what do you find? Rocks.

548
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,960
 These churches made it into the Word of God, made it into the Scriptures,

549
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,560
 yet they did not survive. They ceased to exist.

550
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:04,960
 It makes me think, what right do I have to even think that a church like ours, KFCI, will exist forever?

551
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:11,560
 What Jesus is saying here is, if you cease to exist for the purpose that I have called you for,

552
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,760
 you will cease to exist.

553
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,960
 It makes me think that if we do not honour why God has placed us here,

554
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:23,760
 if we do not truly reflect His love, we could be gone.

555
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,760
 And not because, OK, one way we could go is because if we stop loving each other,

556
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,560
 we'll just self-destruct and then the church will disband. That has happened before, right?

557
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:38,160
 Another way, so Jesus is saying, if you don't stick to the main thing, which is loving,

558
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,760
 you will cease to exist.

559
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,360
 But He's very prepared to do it Himself. He says, here,

560
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,960
 if not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.

561
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,960
 I will do it because you're not reflecting me to the world.

562
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,760
 What's the main argument against us as Christians, why believers don't want to come into the church?

563
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,960
 That you're no better than us. That you're a bunch of hypocrites.

564
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,960
 That you argue within yourselves.

565
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,160
 Why on earth would I want to come into you when I can get all the argument I can have outside?

566
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:24,760
 You guys are the same. And you read all this stuff. And you're still the same.

567
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:30,760
 That's my conviction. That's where I feel that I need always to work on, to remind myself.

568
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:38,160
 That this is why we were placed here, to love. And if we cease to fulfil that, we may cease to exist.

569
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,560
 See, we come to KFCI thinking that it's been around forever and that it will exist forever.

570
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:49,160
 But that's not the case. Things change. But the body of Christ should remain.

571
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,760
 Our love for Him and our love for each other should remain.

572
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,760
 That is the key takeaway for me. Let's carry on. Verse 6.

573
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,960
 "Yet this you have. You hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."

574
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:09,360
 So Jesus, after doing that bad bit, after that threat of "I will destroy you all,"

575
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,560
 he then says, "But you guys still do some good stuff."

576
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:19,560
 The Nicolaitans were a heretical sect that had made compromises and arrangements with pagan society

577
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:26,360
 to basically say, "Hey, we have newfound spiritual freedoms. That should allow us to do whatever we want to do.

578
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:30,360
 So let's try and do both. Let's try and appear to be godly and holy,

579
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,760
 but let's also still indulge in everything that we want to indulge in."

580
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,160
 And that was that group. And so Jesus is saying here to them, "Hey, Church of Ephesus,

581
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,760
 but you are still doing a good job. There are so many temptations out there,

582
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,960
 so many distractions, so many compromises, but yet you guys have remained faithful to me.

583
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,360
 You still do not tolerate sin. You cannot bear with evil. So you are doing well."

584
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,960
 You see, interesting word here, "You hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."

585
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,560
 So he's saying that, well done. Not that they hate the Nicolaitans.

586
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:06,360
 Remember, they hate the works of the Nicolaitans.

587
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,760
 That reminds me of a common saying, "We're not supposed to hate the sinner.

588
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,160
 We're supposed to just hate the sin."

589
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,360
 Again, this is part of what we as a church should have in terms of our identity and our ethos,

590
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,560
 is not to look outside and go, "Those guys are sinners. God will judge you.

591
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,960
 And because of that, I hate you."

592
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,760
 And there's this cancel culture now that we have where we disagree with one thing that person stands for,

593
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,760
 and we dismiss them entirely, and we just declare ourselves free to not need to love them anymore.

594
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,360
 But here, Jesus is saying, "I respect what you do, Church of Ephesus,

595
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,560
 because you hate the works of the Nicolaitans."

596
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:46,760
 And that is our calling as well, that we hate the things of this world,

597
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,960
 but we don't hate the people of the world.

598
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,560
 That our job is to love those who are still indulged in darkness, who are still indulged in sin.

599
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,160
 Our job is to love them just like Jesus loved us when he plucked us out from darkness as well.

600
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,960
 It is not our place to judge their political stance. It's not our place to judge their sexuality.

601
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,160
 It is not our place to look down on them because of their race.

602
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:16,360
 But it is our job to love them, regardless if we disagree with anything that they do.

603
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:23,160
 That is our calling as a church, to love, to keep the main thing the main thing.

604
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
 That is the most important.

605
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,960
 And finally, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.

606
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:37,560
 To the one who conquers, I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."

607
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,360
 And he finishes this, and he finishes this with the Isletters very similarly as well.

608
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,960
 "He who has an ear, let him hear."

609
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,960
 Jesus said this when he was alive. You see in the Gospels. What does it mean?

610
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,160
 It just means everyone, listen up.

611
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:57,160
 It's the part where the preacher goes, "If you don't get anything from my sermon, listen to this."

612
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,960
 Take it seriously. Listen.

613
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,760
 "He who has an ear," and everyone here has ears, at least I think so.

614
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,760
 Everyone has an ear. Listen to what the Spirit is saying to the church.

615
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,760
 Take heed of this advice. Take it seriously.

616
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,360
 Put into your mind what I'm saying right now.

617
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,160
 So the one who conquers, and it is a battle. It isn't easy to love.

618
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,560
 Why is love even a commandment?

619
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,560
 We're not commanded to eat food. We're not commanded to go to the toilet.

620
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:33,160
 We're not commanded to sleep. We're commanded to love because it's the hardest thing to do.

621
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,560
 It's the one thing that Jesus says time and time again.

622
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:39,360
 The greatest commandment is to love God and love people.

623
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,760
 And he commands us because he knows how hard it is and that we will forget.

624
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,760
 Love these people. Choose to love these people.

625
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,360
 Listen to me and choose to find your first love again and love God and love people.

626
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,560
 And if you choose that, you are basically choosing the tree of life.

627
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,160
 In the Garden of Eden, if you remember, there were two trees.

628
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,960
 There was one tree of life and there's another tree of knowledge of good and evil.

629
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,760
 And Jesus is saying, "Choose me."

630
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:17,360
 Choose me in every decision that you make, whether big or small in your life, every single day.

631
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:24,760
 Choose me. And if you choose me, you will be with me in Paradise.

632
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,160
 And how do you choose him?

633
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,960
 You choose to love him and love the people around him with any opportunity that you are given.

634
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:43,560
 Brothers and sisters of KFCI, this letter to the Church of Ephesus, I believe, can also be a letter to us.

635
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:52,560
 I think it also can be a letter to you, to me, to not abandon our first love.

636
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,760
 To remember that is the main thing.

637
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,360
 Keep the main thing the main thing.

638
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:09,160
 Let's pray.

639
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:19,160
 Father, we thank you that you loved us enough to sacrifice your Son for us.

640
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:29,760
 And Jesus, we thank you that you chose to come to this earth to show us how to love.

641
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,160
 And Spirit, we thank you for being so gracious to us that you would speak this message to us.

642
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,160
 And we who have ears commit to listening to you.

643
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:50,960
 That we will not rely on our good works or our resilience, but that we rely on you, our love for you.

644
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,760
 And may that spur us on to loving those around us.

645
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:05,760
 So we spend just a moment now reacquainting ourselves with you.

646
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,760
 And maybe it's quite appropriate as we haven't spent any time together for these last few months,

647
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:18,160
 that as we sit here together, as a community, as a family,

648
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:27,960
 we embrace all the good feelings about being together again and that we look to you together

649
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,160
 and choose not to abandon our first love.

650
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:41,160
 That we remember what brought us here in the first place and that is you.

651
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,760
 So while some of us may have come to church this evening to see friends, to sing songs,

652
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:57,760
 to listen to a message, the truth is we should have come here to see you.

653
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:04,360
 And we remember that you walk amongst our church, you walk with us here.

654
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:11,760
 And we are comforted by that fact that even though the world outside around us is swirling of uncertainty,

655
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:23,760
 you Lord are here with us and that your love for us is so deep and so wide,

656
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,160
 there is nothing we can do to be separated from it.

657
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,160
 So we humble ourselves before you now.

658
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,960
 We thank you for your grace.

00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:48,960
 We celebrate that we are forgiven and we commit to loving you all the days of our lives.

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,960
 And we pray this in your precious name. Amen.
