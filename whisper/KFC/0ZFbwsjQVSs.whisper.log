[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   >> Thank you very much.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   I feel quite overwhelmed.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.920]   This will be my last KFCI Saturday afternoon sermon.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.680]   Not my last sermon, I assure you.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.960]   But nonetheless, it holds a very special significance for Sandra and I.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.240]   And I'm so glad that it comes in this Seeing the Heart of Jesus series.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:44.520]   When we first decided on this series, I had no idea it would be my last in this role.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.720]   It was meant just as a genuine follow-up from our Serving the Community series.
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.160]   But for me, things move fast in Hong Kong.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:08.160]   I've been so grateful for all six of our speakers in this series, and feel doubly honored to
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.160]   bring this week's talk on A Heart That Forgives.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:21.440]   As we look at Jesus and the woman caught in adultery.
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.560]   I am so excited, James.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.960]   I'm so excited for the new English service and the new location.
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:39.120]   I love you all to get 100% behind Pastor James, Christina, and the team.
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:48.600]   One promise, Sandra and I will be your biggest cheerleaders.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.400]   This week I've really wrestled, I've toiled.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.120]   I've grasped to find something I wanted to leave you with.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:08.320]   Something that would hopefully carry you through the rest of your lives and indeed into eternity.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.080]   Something you might look back on and say, "Yeah, Pastor John taught us this."
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.720]   I got my answer in the unlikely shape of a new song.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.680]   No, I'm not going to sing.
[00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.120]   Done that.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.200]   Just a few weeks ago I came across a brand new song by Phil Wickham.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.800]   We sing a lot of Phil Wickham songs here.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.480]   This is Amazing Grace, Living Hope, Hymn of Heaven, etc.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.040]   It's called The Jesus Way, and it reflects so much of what we have been hearing here
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.320]   week after week during this Seeing the Heart of Jesus series.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.860]   Phil Wickham could have written it for this series and especially tonight's sermon.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.960]   Just look at some of the words.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.360]   I've put them on the screen.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.960]   If you curse me, then I will bless you.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.520]   If you hurt me, I will forgive.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.880]   If you hate me, then I will love you.
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.980]   I choose the Jesus way.
[00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.640]   If you're helpless, I will defend you.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.360]   If you're burdened, I'll share the weight.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.560]   If you're hopeless, then let me show you.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.400]   There's hope in the Jesus way.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.360]   I follow Jesus.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.780]   I follow Jesus.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.800]   He wore my sin.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.200]   I gladly bear his name.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   I love that line.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.760]   He is the treasure.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   He is the answer.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.080]   Oh, I choose the Jesus way.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.280]   The Jesus way.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:18.340]   My prayer is that when we look back on these past seven years, we would all say the one
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:26.280]   thing that we learned together was to do things the Jesus way.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.920]   But we were not unduly influenced by church culture, prevailing trends in the church,
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.940]   or by how people expected us to be.
[00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.520]   But we tried our very best, and not always succeeding, of course.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:51.840]   But we tried our very best to be the hands and feet of the Lord Jesus and demonstrated
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.020]   His heart in all we've done.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:03.880]   So before tonight's passage, I want you to watch the lyric video.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:13.100]   And as you watch it, open your heart to the words that you're about to hear.
[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:24.800]   And as you hear them, I pray that you will resolve to follow Jesus in faith and obedience
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.040]   and choose the Jesus way.
[00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.040]   Let's watch the video.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.040]   If you curse me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   If you hurt me, then I will heal you.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:06:10.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:07:00.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:21.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:45.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:08:13.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:09:03.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:23.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:58.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:39.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:46.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:58.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:19.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:49.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:22.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:46.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.040]   If you love me, then I will bless you.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:57.040]   Does this event seem to be consistent with the heart and attitude of Jesus as he is portrayed through the gospel?
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.040]   And my answer is a resounding yes.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.040]   It is an embodiment.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   It is a powerful expression of the Jesus way.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:16.040]   And yet it starts off with a fishing story.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.040]   What? You say what?
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.040]   Now, me and fishing do not get on.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:25.040]   I've got to tell you this.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:31.040]   I do not have sea legs. I get seasick on the Star Ferry.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:39.040]   On the other hand, my son Matt, who lives in Saicong, tries to get out and go fishing every morning.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.040]   But it wasn't his dad that taught him.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.040]   It was his mom.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   But what I do know about fishing is this.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   Bait is an important part of fishing.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   Now, why am I saying this?
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   My friends, this woman was bait.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   Fish bait.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:19.040]   The teachers and the Pharisees wanted to trap Jesus and were willing to see this woman put to death in order to get to him.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.040]   Let's read it.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   At dawn, he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:44.040]   They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, "Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery."
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   Now, what do you say?
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   They were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   The trap is set.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   The setting is, it is early morning.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   We read in verse 2, "At dawn, and Jesus has come into the temple to teach."
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   We read a crowd gathered as one might have expected, given the news of Jesus' teaching had spread widely.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.040]   This is one of the reasons the authorities were after him.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   And we can imagine the scene of the crowd intently listening to Jesus,
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.040]   when all of a sudden, there was a kerfuffle.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.040]   I like that word. I've never used that in a sermon before. I'll use it again.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:53.040]   There was a kerfuffle at the back of the room.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   Imagine the scene of the crowd intently listening to Jesus.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:17.040]   Slowly, the crowd parts, and a woman being dragged forward by the officially robed scribes and Pharisees is thrust before Jesus.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   Imagine the scene. Them in their robes, and her clothes all over the place, and looking a real mess.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   Why? Because she had just been caught in adultery.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:48.040]   Dragged from her bed, she became fish bait. The objective, to trap Jesus.
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   "Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery."
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:59.040]   "In the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women."
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   "Now what do you say?"
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:09.040]   "This woman had committed a capital offence."
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:19.040]   "And it's important to note that neither Jesus, nor the woman refutes, denies the charge against her."
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:23.040]   "She is guilty."
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.040]   Full stop.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:36.040]   "And the law states, the penalty is death by stoning."
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:44.040]   You can see, can't you, that Jesus is faced with the ultimate dilemma.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:50.040]   Here is the dilemma. How does God balance his justice and his mercy?
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:19:02.040]   If God is a God of righteousness, and a God of justice, and a God of judgment by his holy nature, she must die.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   If God is a God of love, and a God of grace, and a God of kindness, and mercy, and forgiveness, she must live.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:20.040]   How can he be a God of justice, and forgive sin?
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:25.040]   How can he be a God of love, and punish sin?
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:35.040]   A dilemma is when you have two options, and no matter what you select, you're in trouble.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:43.040]   Option one, show mercy and compassion to this woman, and demand she be set free.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:52.040]   But if he does so, he will be seen as defying the law of Moses, and risk discrediting his teaching and ministry.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   Option two, order her execution by stoning, and affirm his allegiance to Moses' law.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:06.040]   But actually, only the Roman government was allowed to execute capital punishment.
[00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:17.040]   And if Jesus orders the woman's death, he is in violation to Rome, and could potentially be handed over to the authorities, and even executed himself.
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:21.040]   Either way, he's in trouble.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   Either with Israel, or with Rome. It's like tossing a coin.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:32.040]   Heads he loses, tails he loses.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.040]   But let's look at the real truth here.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   The context. And for that, we need to go back to the previous chapter, the night before this event.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.040]   I want to read this to you.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:53.040]   "Finally, the temple guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked him, 'Why didn't you bring him in?'
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:57.040]   'No one ever spoke the way this man does,' the guards replied.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:02.040]   'You mean, as he deceived you also?' the Pharisees retorted.
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:05.040]   'Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in him?'
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:12.040]   'No, but this mob that knows nothing of the law, there is a curse on them.'"
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   The scene here. They were meeting in secret.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:22.040]   "They had ordered the temple police to arrest Jesus and bring him to them.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:28.040]   But instead, the guards were mesmerized by Jesus' teaching.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   They said, 'No one's ever spoken the way this man does.'
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:38.040]   That was their reply to the question, 'Why didn't you bring him in?'
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:43.040]   Hence, the trap.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.040]   And they conveniently manipulate the law to trap Jesus.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   Look at this. Deuteronomy 22.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:59.040]   "If a man is found sleeping with another man's wife,
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   both the man who slept with her and the woman must die."
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   You must purge evil from Israel.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:27.040]   Verse 24. "You shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death."
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   Now the obvious question here is, where is the man?
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   They were going to uphold the law, right?
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   But where was the man? He was supposed to be punished.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.040]   They're not interested in upholding the law.
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:51.040]   They're only interested in trapping Jesus.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:57.040]   Apparently, the religious leaders were not only willing to let this woman be stoned to death
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.040]   in order to attract Jesus.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   They were also willing to let some unidentified, unattested Jewish man
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:14.040]   to commit the sin of adultery so that they would have some bait in the trap they were setting for Jesus.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   Their aim was simple. Destroy Jesus.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   And they were happy to have a man's adultery ignored
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:30.040]   and a woman killed to accomplish their goals.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   How would Jesus react at this blatant attempt to manipulate justice?
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:44.040]   What would be the Jesus way?
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   Look at this. This is brilliant.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:55.040]   "But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger."
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   Just imagine the scene. I wish I'd been there.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.040]   The crowd are holding their breath.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:06.040]   They're waiting for Jesus' response.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   But he doesn't speak to the woman. He doesn't speak to the accusers.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   Instead, he stoops down and writes in the dirt at his feet.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:23.040]   Now, the great question that scholars have wrestled with over the years is
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:28.040]   what exactly did Jesus write in the sand?
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   Some believe he was writing the Pharisees' names and possibly their sins.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:38.040]   This theory is based primarily on Jeremiah 17.13.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.040]   "Those who depart from me shall be written in the earth
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:47.040]   because they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living waters."
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:52.040]   In the preceding chapter of John, Jesus spoke of himself as living water.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:55.040]   So perhaps he was fulfilling a prophecy.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.040]   Others believe it was to demonstrate, as God the Father did
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.040]   when he carved the Ten Commandments in stone with his finger,
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:07.040]   that Jesus had the authority to issue two new commandments
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.040]   for us to love God and love one another.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   We don't know for sure what Jesus was writing.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.040]   Nor do we know who saw his message.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:20.040]   I'd like to think that once the crowd had dispersed
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.040]   and he was left to deal with the woman himself,
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:28.040]   he'd have written only one other word, "forgiven."
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:31.040]   But who knows?
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:38.040]   So then, after writing in the dirt, what is his response?
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.040]   Let's read his response.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   Verse 7, "When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them,
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:53.040]   'Let any one of you who was without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.'
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.040]   Again he stooped down and wrote in the ground.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   At this, those who heard began to go away, one at a time,
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   the elder ones first, until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there."
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:16.040]   Friends, this is the game changer.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   We read, "The leaders kept on questioning him."
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.040]   They wouldn't let up.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   In my mind, they keep on hammering the question.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.040]   What do you say we do with this adulterous woman?
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.040]   Do we stone her? What do you say?
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.040]   Maybe they were throwing out more challenges and taunts.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.040]   Answer us, prophet.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.040]   What does your father have to say, son of God?
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:45.040]   Mobs have a tendency to get louder and more aggressive.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.040]   Maybe there was some pushing and shoving.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   There is no other way to describe this except as an ugly scene.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.040]   But before they know what happens,
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   the Bible tells us that Jesus straightens up and takes control of the situation.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:13.040]   He changes the rules of the game in 18 words,
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.040]   maybe in less than 10 seconds.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:42.040]   Suddenly the issue is not about Jesus' credibility or the woman's guilt.
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:53.040]   Jesus turns the table by making the issue about who is and who is not qualified to judge another human being.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:59.040]   The issue is not the standard.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:10.040]   The benchmark has moved from one not committing the sin of adultery to one who is without sin.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   Which, by the way, is why God alone is qualified to judge sins in human beings.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:24.040]   By the way, some of us would do well to remember that.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.040]   What Jesus is saying is this.
[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.040]   This is God's business, not yours.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:36.040]   You don't even have a right to bring up the issue.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:42.040]   And so the charade of religious righteousness has been exposed
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   because they know they can't claim utter sinlessness.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:55.040]   These men who are happy to destroy, entrap, and judge others sink away in embarrassment,
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:05.040]   dropping their stones, ready to plot other ways to destroy Jesus.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   The older ones first, until only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   Only Jesus was left with the woman still standing there.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:33.040]   Now let's look at how Jesus completes the rescue.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:42.040]   Jesus straightened up and asked her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:49.040]   "No one, sir," she said. "Then neither do I condemn you," Jesus declared.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   "Go now and leave your life of sin."
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.040]   Now put yourself in the woman's place.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:01.040]   She's been caught with her hands in the proverbial cookie jar.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:07.040]   She has been publicly charged and is genuinely guilty.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.040]   And now she has a one-on-one with Jesus.
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:17.040]   But how will he respond to her?
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   He basically says to her, "Woman, where are those accusers of yours?"
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:28.040]   "No one has condemned you. If no one wants to prosecute, the trial is over."
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   And my friends, three things.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:39.040]   Condemnation, correction, and compassion are the issues here.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.040]   Firstly, the Jesus way is not condemnation.
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.040]   He says, "Then neither do I condemn you."
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:54.040]   But note the Jesus way is correction.
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:56.040]   "Go now and leave your life of sin."
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.040]   This is important and should not be ignored.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:10.040]   But above all, the Jesus way is compassion.
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:17.040]   For the first time in probably a long time, someone views her as a person, not a thing.
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   For the first time in probably a long time, someone interacts with her
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.040]   with a real concern for her well-being and not for his selfish ends.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.040]   For the first time in probably a long time, she feels the warmth of compassion,
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   albeit with strict words of discipline and correction,
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   and remembers what it feels like to be a human being.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:45.040]   I think she was going to live out the rest of her life doing what she could
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:51.040]   to please Jesus because of the gratitude that she had in her heart.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:57.040]   In conclusion, the two most popular words in any sermon.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:08.040]   In conclusion, if I had to sum up the Jesus way in one word,
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.040]   I'd use grace.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.040]   I'd use grace.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:25.040]   I hope, I pray, when we look back on these past seven years of Saturday afternoons,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:36.040]   that what we would have experienced at the center of this service
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   is exactly that, grace.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:47.040]   Jesus' interaction with this woman, she was more accustomed to being used than being loved,
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   is a powerful reminder that our lives, both past and present,
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.040]   I love this, I'll put it on the screen,
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:10.040]   the product of our past needs to be resolved in our present to secure our future.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.040]   Screenshot that, well done.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:22.040]   The product of our past needs to be resolved in our present to secure our future.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:28.040]   And the key behind that resolution is the grace of our Lord.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:33.040]   He deals directly with her problems and then directs her towards a future
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:41.040]   that is pointed towards life and away from the self-destructed habits of the past.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:47.040]   Grace is the heart of God that loves people.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:58.040]   And nowhere is grace seen so clearly than in the life of this someone who knows undeservedness.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:07.040]   I wonder if we are grateful for what Jesus has done for us.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   I want to call you, I want to call the church, the one church.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:20.040]   Many of us have grown up in churches where it seems the law of Moses
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:24.040]   seems more important than the grace of Jesus.
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:29.040]   Rules, rules, rules, rules, rules.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:38.040]   I remember meeting with two pastors after a tragic high-profile suicide
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:44.040]   and asking the question, "Was she a Christian?"
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:50.040]   I was given the answer, "She was a lesbian."
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   That response absolutely broke my heart.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   My friends, choose the Jesus way.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:09.040]   See the heart of Jesus and use it as your compass.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:14.040]   If you are here tonight and you are not following Jesus,
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:25.040]   I want to say to you, I'm sorry for the Jesus that we as Christians at times have shown you.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   The headmaster wanting to punish your mistakes.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:38.040]   I invite you to be like this woman and run into his arms.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:45.040]   Experience his love, his forgiveness and grace.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:53.040]   To surrender your life to him right here, right now.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   As I ask the band to return, please Paul.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:10.040]   I leave my final words to Phil Wickham.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.040]   This is what he says in that song.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:21.040]   "And I choose surrender. I choose to love.
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   Oh God my Savior, you'll always be enough.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   I choose forgiveness. I choose grace.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:41.040]   I choose to worship no matter what I face.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:54.040]   I choose the Jesus way." Let's stand.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   I'd love to pray for you.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.040]   I just wonder if you just stretch your hands in front of you.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.040]   It's not a religious thing. Sometimes we do in church to say,
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.040]   "I'm open to receive what God has for me."
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:13.040]   And if there's anyone here who hasn't received Jesus as their personal Lord and Savior,
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.040]   I want to give you an opportunity right here and now
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:25.040]   to choose forgiveness, to choose grace.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.040]   We can look at this woman, but we've all done things wrong.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:40.040]   But she was able to run into the arms of Jesus.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:45.040]   If you just say this prayer in your heart, "Lord Jesus,
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:51.040]   I come to you now for forgiveness. I receive your grace.
[00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:58.040]   I'm a sinner in need of forgiveness. I choose grace.
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:10.040]   I receive your love for me. Forgive my sins and come into my life right now."
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:15.040]   And if you've prayed that prayer, please tell someone before you leave tonight
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.040]   and get them to pray for you.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:25.040]   And for the rest of us, I'm just going to pray now for the Holy Spirit just to come
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:32.040]   to fill us afresh.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.040]   We know choosing the Jesus way is not easy.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.040]   We can't do it on our own.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.040]   We need each other.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:50.040]   But we need, Lord, the power of your Spirit.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:59.040]   As we sing this song together, Lord, I pray that you will show us.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:06.040]   Show us the way forward so that we can say as a church,
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:14.040]   so that we can say as a church in this city, we chose the Jesus way.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.040]   Let's worship God.
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:26.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
