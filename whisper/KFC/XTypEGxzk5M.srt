1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Merry Christmas, everyone.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Speaking of Christmas,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 we all talk about giving presents.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Whether it's receiving presents or giving presents.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 It was funny just now,

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Mender Stanley said

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 everyone wants to get presents.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Presents always bring people happiness.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 Or Christmas is an opportunity

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 to express your gratitude.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 You may have someone in your heart,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 your parents, your friends, or your loved ones.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 You will always think carefully

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 what present to buy for them.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 How should I give them?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I've thought it all out.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 How should I give them?

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 If you have someone important in your heart,

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 you will always rehearse

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 how to give them a present.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I think it's difficult to give a present.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 How do I find the perfect gift?

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 You don't want to give a present

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 to someone who doesn't like it.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 If the person doesn't like it,

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 the person will transfer the present to someone else.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 Or if the person is very thoughtful,

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 you will put the present in the drawer

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 and see when it's the right time to use it.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 But it may always be in the drawer.

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 So you always want to find a present

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 that the person really likes.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 When you see the person using it,

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 you will be happy.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 How to buy a present like this?

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I asked Kirstie a question just now.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 What is the most memorable present you received?

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Hugo and Kirstie said it's a difficult question.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 When they asked me,

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 I had some answers in my mind,

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 but I didn't want to say it.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 But I want to say

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 what are the elements of a memorable present?

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 First, no matter what answer you have in your mind,

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 what is a memorable present?

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 The first element is related to the person who gave it to you.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 It's not about a person who doesn't know how to use it.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Even if the person gave you a beautiful present,

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 you will say, "Okay, fine, thank you."

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 It's related to the person who gave it to you.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I watched a clip before.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 The person said, "I have a present in my bag."

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 "I will give it to you."

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 What is it?

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 It's like this.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 If it's your idol or someone you like,

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 and he gave you a heart filled with air,

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 you will be very happy.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 It's free.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 The second element is related to the person's intention.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 It's not just a present from someone you like.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 The person has a thought about you.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 He has thought about your needs.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 He has thought about why you like him.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 The person's intention and time.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 This present is not just a physical object in front of you.

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 It's from his heart.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 One day, I found my mom's bedside table.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 She put a birthday card I drew for her when I was young.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 I think I was about 6 or 7 years old.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 There was a Donald Duck on it.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I drew it as if it was a little crooked.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 It wasn't too similar.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 It was a little kid's birthday card.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 She put it on her bedside table.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 I knew she valued it.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 What else would you put on your bedside table?

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 It's not about how beautiful it is or how expensive it is.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 It's about the person's intention.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Thirdly, what are the elements that make you feel touched?

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 It should be useful.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 If it's not useful,

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 even if he's thoughtful,

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 you should put it in your heart.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Recently, a friend of mine sent me a milk machine.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 It's used to make coffee.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I told him I couldn't drink milk.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 I'm lactose intolerant, so I couldn't drink milk.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Even if he was thoughtful and wanted to send me a milk machine,

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 it's beautiful, but I couldn't use it.

91
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I told him to send it to someone else.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 So, there are several elements that make a gift meaningful.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 First, it's about who sent it.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Second, it represents the person's intention.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Third, it's useful.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 We've talked about gifts for a long time.

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 On Christmas, we celebrate Jesus' birth.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 At the same time, we thank God.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 He sent us a big Christmas gift.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 This gift is Jesus Christ himself.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Jesus Christ himself included

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 a gift of love, a gift of life,

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 a gift of peace, and a gift of hope.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Let's look at 2 Cor. 10-12.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Let's read it in English.

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 1, 2, 3.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Thank you, everyone.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 What is the background of this angel?

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Jesus Christ was already born in the manger.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 The angel suddenly appeared to a group of sheep.

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 The sheep were very scared.

112
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 The angel said, "Do not be afraid."

113
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 "I bring good news to you."

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 This is a good news.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 Why?

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Because David's city is where the king will be born.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 "For you have a Savior."

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 He is the Lord Jesus Christ.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 If you read it in English,

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 "a Savior, a Messiah, and a Lord."

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 In the Old Testament, God is the Savior.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Messiah is Christ.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Christ is the Savior.

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 The Israelites have been waiting for a long time

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 to be saved by Christ.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 The Lord is like a king.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 He is above you, but he will protect you,

128
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 guide you, and provide for you.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 God has given you this gift.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 So Christmas is a good news.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 This figure, the Savior, the Messiah, the Lord.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 We rarely see this.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 Usually, we see Jesus or Jesus Christ.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 It looks like a name.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 But it includes a Savior, a leader,

136
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 a figure who will provide for us and protect us.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Now, he is a little baby.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 In the 12th chapter, he is a baby in a baby bag.

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 This is a symbol.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 You see, this is the appearance of this gift.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 This gift is like a gift we received

142
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 after coming back to church.

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 It is nothing special.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 We believe in Jesus.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Everyone has a God in their heart.

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 But why is this Christmas gift so special?

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 Because this represents God's love.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 I want to use John 3, chapter 16

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 to tell you that this is a gift of love.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 The gift is so special because

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 it represents the heart of the person behind it.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 It says, "God loves the world."

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 This gift includes God's love.

154
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 I think we can't say that we humans don't need love.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 As humans, from a psychological perspective,

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 we have a great desire to be accepted and to be loved.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 When you choose a team to compete,

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 you always want to be chosen.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 You want to be chosen.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Deep down, we have a desire to be loved.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 But when we were young,

162
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 we wanted to be loved by our parents.

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 When we grew up, we wanted to be loved by our teachers and friends.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 When we grew up, we wanted to have romantic love.

165
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 We have different desires for love at different times.

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 But we often find love in the wrong places.

167
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 Because we have a great desire for love.

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Sometimes we even give in to love in the wrong places.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 But now, God says that He loves us.

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 This is not a slogan.

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 He says that He gives us limitless love.

172
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 But human love is very limited.

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 For example, my new friend came to my team.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 I love her.

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 But she will say bad things about others in the team.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I will tolerate her and tell her not to do that again.

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Next time, she will say bad things about others again.

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 I think human love is limited.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 We like beautiful things, beautiful people, and talented people.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 We want them to be in the same team as us.

181
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 No matter how patient we are,

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 human love is limited.

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 But God says that His love is limitless.

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 What is limitless?

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 The Bible describes His love as "long, broad, and deep."

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 What is "long"?

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 It is the limitless love of time.

188
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 God loves you today, God loves you yesterday,

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 God loves you today, no matter what you do,

190
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 God will love you tomorrow, too.

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 What is "broad"?

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 We may do something wrong,

193
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 and God will not forgive us.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 But God's love is much greater than our sins.

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 God's love can cover a very wide range.

196
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 What is "long"?

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 I think it is the extent of His love.

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 What is "deep"?

199
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 No matter how deep we are in the earth,

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 no matter how big our mistakes are,

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 no matter how far we are from God,

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 no matter how deep we are in the heart,

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 God will find us in the deepest, darkest place.

204
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 This is God's limitless love.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 What is "conditional"?

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 We often think that teachers love those who have good grades,

207
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 who help the school to win awards,

208
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 who sing well,

209
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 who are good at sports,

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 who have conditional love.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 Sometimes, our parents are like brothers and sisters.

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 Would it be that the elder brother is better,

213
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 and the younger brother loves him more?

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 But God says no.

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
 God's love is unconditional.

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Even if we are distrusted,

217
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 God says He is still trustworthy,

218
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 because He cannot deny Himself.

219
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 God's love is simply love.

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 So Jesus Christ is an unconditional love.

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 Actually, for a long time,

222
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 even though I was a Christian or a mentor,

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 I found that I did not quite understand

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 what is unconditional love.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Until I was in the deepest, darkest place.

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 God met me unconditionally with grace,

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 with mercy,

228
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 accepted me back,

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 and loved me.

230
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 Then I knew what is unconditional love.

231
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 This is also an action-filled love.

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Jesus Christ Himself walked on the cross

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 to die for us.

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 So it is not just a talk.

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Many times, we say, "I love you."

236
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 "I pray for you. Rest in peace."

237
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 This is love.

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 But Jesus Christ came to this world

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 to suffer the greatest suffering

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 so that we can be saved.

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 This is an action-filled love.

242
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 This is also a very precious gift.

243
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Why is it so precious?

244
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 Because it is God's love for us.

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 Even His only begotten Son.

246
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 I don't know how much money you would spend

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 to buy a gift for your friend.

248
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 300 dollars?

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 500 dollars?

250
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 1000 dollars?

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 God says His only begotten Son is the price.

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 It is something you like very much.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Sometimes, when we buy a gift,

254
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 and we don't even want to spend extra time

255
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 or extra effort,

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 when I say, "I want to take what you like the most

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 and exchange it for a gift,"

258
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 how would you feel?

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 A gift is expensive.

260
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 It equates to how much you are willing to sacrifice

261
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 to buy this gift.

262
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 God is willing to give His only begotten Son

263
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 to exchange this gift for us

264
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 so that we can have a gift.

265
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 Thank you, Maurice.

266
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 Thank you, Gabriel.

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 This gift is free.

268
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 It is a gift, so it must be free.

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 If you have to pay, it is not a gift.

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 It is free, but it is not cheap.

271
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 It represents God sacrificing His only beloved Son

272
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 to exchange for our salvation

273
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 to give us this gift.

274
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 This gift is a very important gift.

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 This gift determines your eternal ending.

276
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 In John 3, verse 16, it says,

277
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 "God has given His only begotten Son

278
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 to give to them all that they may believe in Him,

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 not only to perish but also to live forever."

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Do you accept this gift

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 as determining your destiny?

282
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 Where are you in your eternal journey?

283
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Are you going to perish?

284
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 Or will you have eternal life?

285
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 I think the same thing about receiving gifts

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 is that you have to open the gift.

287
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 God has put a gift in front of you today.

288
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 You may not open it.

289
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 If you don't open it, it will always be next to you.

290
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 I may be one of those people.

291
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Although you have been in church for a long time,

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 the gift is next to you,

293
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 but you have never thought of opening it.

294
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 You think the gift will always be there.

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 How do you truly enjoy the gift?

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 You have to take off the ribbon,

297
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 take off the wrapping paper,

298
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 and really open it.

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 You have to let Jesus Christ enter your life.

300
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 You have to receive it.

301
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 What is receiving?

302
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 John 3, verse 16 says,

303
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 "All who receive Him will believe in Him."

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 This is what it means to be a believer.

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 This is what John says.

306
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 How do you receive Jesus into your life?

307
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 You may not think about this for a long time.

308
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 You may think, "I am a believer. I will follow the Church."

309
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 "I will believe."

310
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 But will God put this gift in front of you again today?

311
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Will you say to Him, "Yes, I need this gift."

312
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 "I need this love."

313
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 I have been to different places in the world,

314
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 even the wrong places,

315
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 but I still could not fulfill the desire in my heart.

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Today, Jesus said,

317
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 "I have come to give you hope, to give you life."

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 He will give you and guide you

319
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 in your life.

320
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And in eternity,

321
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Jesus said, "I want to be with you."

322
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 "I want to be with you."

323
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 "Do you want to be with me?"

324
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Jesus said, "I stand outside the door,

325
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 and if you hear my voice, open the door."

326
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 "I want to go to him. I want to meet him."

327
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 "He wants to meet me."

328
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 "Let us eat together."

329
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 "Let us sit together."

330
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Jesus said, "Today, I put this gift in front of you."

331
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 "I want to enter your home."

332
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 "Will you recognize me?"

333
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 In the midst of all this,

334
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 is there anyone who will accept this gift today?

335
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Jesus is waiting for you.

336
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 He wants to love you.

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 It is not that we need God.

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 It is not that Jesus needs us.

339
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 It is that we need him.

340
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 The God who is behind this gift,

341
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 is thinking of you in his heart.

342
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 He is someone you need.

343
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 And he knows you need this gift.

344
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 You need him.

345
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Let us pray together.

346
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Thank you, God, for giving us such a precious gift,

347
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Jesus Christ.

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Many times, we take it for granted.

349
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Ever since we were young, we have been going to church.

350
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 We never thought about God.

351
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 Your greatness, your goodness.

352
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Even though we go to church,

353
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 we still find love in different places,

354
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 in our schools,

355
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 in different people.

356
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 But we forget that God is love.

357
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 And you let Jesus Christ come into your life

358
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 to show us the image of your love.

359
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 God, we pray that you help us.

360
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 If we find love in different places today,

361
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 why don't we tell you again today

362
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 that we need you.

363
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 We need you in our lives.

364
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 We pray that you enter our lives.

365
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Lead us in our lives.

366
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Let us enjoy the blessings and abundance

367
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 behind this gift.

368
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 God, if we still have some sins in our lives,

369
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 we have tried many different ways to overcome our sins,

370
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 but we find that we cannot completely overcome them.

371
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 God, we pray that you let us let go of our lives today

372
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 and give them to you.

373
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Accept this gift from Jesus Christ.

374
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Because you can help us overcome all our sins

375
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 and cleanse all our sins.

376
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 God, we pray that you let us not choose any solution in this world.

377
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Today, we accept you.

378
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 We choose you in all our choices.

379
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 God, we pray that you come into our lives

380
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 and lead us in our lives to be in peace, joy, and abundance.

381
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 God, we pray that you let us accept this gift

382
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 and help us to be a gift to others.

383
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 God, we pray that you hear our prayers.

384
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.

385
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
