[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   It's been great.
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.200]   This series is on the church, and it's amazing to see how we as the church have grown throughout
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.180]   the years and how we can still continue to grow.
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.820]   And today we're talking about a hospitality-driven church.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.520]   And Pastor John introduced this sermon for us, and he talked about this chair, right?
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.960]   How the church tries to just stand on one leg, right?
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.040]   Whether it's prayer, community, generosity, or the Word of God, they're trying to just
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.080]   stand on one leg, right?
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.560]   And maybe it's one amazing speaker, and they're just trying to depend on that.
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.200]   And Pastor James talked to us last week about gathering about God's Word.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.600]   And what analogy did he use?
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.380]   It wasn't a chair, it was a?
[00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.820]   It was a stool, right?
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.760]   And the stool represented the Word of God, and the legs represented that each thing was
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.080]   the Word of God allowed us to have prayer, community, and hospitality.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.760]   And today we're talking about sharing meals and taking communion together.
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.640]   And who likes food here?
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.640]   Yeah?
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.960]   Okay, some of you are on a diet.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.440]   So my analogy this week is a table, and it's a round table, but I won't tell you what it
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.840]   means until the end.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.320]   I remember I was in Sydney, and Hillsong has been going through all sorts of drama lately,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.920]   but when I went to the church in Sydney, as you see in the next slide, I had a great time.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.200]   The worship was amazing, the talk was amazing, and afterwards the welcoming team invited
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.200]   me to have a free lunch.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.800]   And it was like, wow, you know, it was great company, it was great food, and then afterwards
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.800]   they drove me home also.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.400]   So it was like, wow, such a great time of worshiping God together and having community
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   together.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.240]   And I remember in the next slide, I was in UK, and I joined this church, it was a Baptist
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.440]   church, and we had a time of mingling afterwards, and there was food and lunch afterwards, and
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.520]   it was just so good just connecting with the people there and talking to them about, you
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.840]   know, what I do and how I'm doing some mission work in other countries.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.760]   And they're like, "Oh, we should partner together."
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.280]   It was so amazing.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.320]   I remember this one time I went to New Zealand, and I was actually sitting beside somebody
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.760]   who went to church.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.360]   And after the flight, they were like, "You should come over for a meal."
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.120]   And so I went over to their meal.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.080]   Oh, I've known them for, I don't know, like 12 hours, that's the flight time.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.600]   And they invited me over for a meal.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.360]   And afterwards, I went to church with them, and they prayed over me because I was heading
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.640]   to do missions afterwards, to India to do missions.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:24.600]   The meals I had with them and the times I shared with them, they were precious moments,
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   precious moments of connecting not only with each other, but with the Lord.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.040]   And this is what the early church did.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.600]   It says in Acts chapter 2, they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.400]   to the breaking of bread, and to prayer.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   And this word koinonia, fellowship, it also appears in 1 John chapter 1.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.840]   And this is what it says, "That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.720]   we have seen with our eyes, we have looked upon, that which we have seen and heard, we
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.480]   proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   And indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ."
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:23.040]   It says it very clearly here, that John has experienced Jesus and the things he's experienced
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:32.520]   because of Jesus, he's sharing it to them so that we can have fellowship with each other
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.680]   because we have fellowship with God.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.400]   This word koinonia, fellowship, not only does it mean gathering and community, but it also
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.200]   means that we are participants, we are sharing something.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   We're sharing something.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:56.360]   And the best example of this is, of course, the Trinity.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.440]   The Trinity, right?
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:04.200]   The Trinity is three in one, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.320]   They are sharing in fellowship.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.920]   They are sharing love, communicating with each other, working with each other, yet there
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.480]   is unity.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.760]   There is unity.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:26.000]   God is the greatest example of fellowship, the three in one.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.240]   And God created us.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:37.280]   We were made in His image, and He created us also for this longing for connection, right?
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.960]   Who's experienced this longing for deep connection before in their life?
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.880]   Yeah, you've experienced it?
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.200]   There's this connection.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.920]   We want to connect with people around us.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:58.560]   And ultimately, God created us for a spiritual connection, a relationship with Him.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.560]   And we see in these circles, right, that there's so many connections that God created.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.320]   God created a relationship with Him first, and then with Adam and Eve, God created the
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.960]   relationship, connection with marriage, and with marriage came family, family, the church,
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.120]   and the society.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:26.080]   And today, we're going to look at three different areas in the Bible of table fellowship.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.520]   We're going to look at the Old Testament, we're going to look at the New Testament,
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:36.960]   and then we're going to look at the Eternal Testament or eternal times, OT, NT, and ET.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.560]   I just try to make it rhyme, you know?
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.400]   OT, NT, and ET.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   Going home?
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   Oh, yeah, ET, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   Yeah, go home.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:54.360]   The first part we're going to look at is the Old Testament, and we're going to look at
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.080]   Exodus chapter 24 together.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.440]   And so, this is what was happening.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.480]   The Israelites, they had the great Exodus out of bondage, out of Egypt, and then they
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.120]   became free, and they arrived at Mount Sinai.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.840]   Did you guys go to Mount Sinai during your Israel trip?
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.840]   No?
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.840]   I want to go to Mount Sinai.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.920]   We'll hike off and maybe I'll experience the Lord there.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.000]   It would be amazing, right?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.520]   And so, what happened was Moses was on the mountain, right?
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.120]   And then they invited, you know, Moses and Aaron and the 70 elders.
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:37.400]   They went up, and they saw God at the Mount of Sinai.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.960]   And on Mount Sinai, do you know what they did together?
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.960]   In verse 11, it says this, "He did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   Israel.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.240]   They beheld God and ate and drank."
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:03.520]   They went up Mount Sinai, and God was there, and the elders saw him.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.200]   And what did they do?
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.400]   They ate and they drank.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:15.320]   They had fellowship with God on Mount Sinai.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.000]   It must have been a nice picnic.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.400]   I don't know what it was.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:26.960]   They were eating, maybe more manna, or manna hadn't come yet, but special bread.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:33.000]   The Old Testament is full of festivals.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.400]   So on Mount Sinai, then God gave Moses what?
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.560]   The laws, the 10 commandments, right?
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.440]   And then Moses shared them with the people.
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.960]   And there was all these festivals, right?
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:53.540]   The Sabbath celebrates the rest that God had after creation.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:57.720]   And on the Sabbath, the Jewish nation would eat together.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.720]   They wouldn't work.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:04.360]   They would gather together to remember what God had created and to rest.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:11.480]   On the Passover, they were feasting to celebrate the Exodus.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:18.120]   I remember in our church, we invited some Jewish people to come and share about the
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:23.240]   Passover, and it was so interesting.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:33.840]   The roasted shank bone that they have represents the sacrifice that the people had to endure.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:40.040]   The egg that they eat during Passover represents spring and the circle of life.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:48.040]   The bitter herbs that they have represented the bitterness of slavery.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:54.320]   The three pieces of unleavened bread represents the bread that the Israelites took with them
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.240]   when they fled Egypt.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:08.100]   The salt water that they have during the Passover represents the tears that the slaves had.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:18.800]   When they are eating the Passover meal, every part of the meal represents something that
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.800]   God did.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:27.640]   Imagine eating together, remembering God together.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:36.040]   There is both vertical fellowship with the Lord and horizontal fellowship with each other.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.520]   There's more festivals.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:44.680]   The first festivals of the first fruits is remembering God's providence.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.440]   The festival of trumpets was a day of reminding people to reflect on themselves.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:56.640]   There would be a big trumpet that would be blown, and people would be called to remember
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:01.280]   what they had done and repent before the Lord.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:09.480]   They had this dipped apple in honey that wished everybody a good and sweet new year.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:16.560]   The festival of tabernacles points to the commandment that God told them to stay temporarily
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.000]   in the tents in the desert before the temple was made.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.120]   So we see here in the Old Testament, they ate.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.840]   They ate with the Lord.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:36.760]   The examples of the elders eating together, there was vertical worship, fellowship with
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.560]   the Lord when they ate.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:45.800]   When they ate together with all these festivals, they remembered, they celebrated, they worshiped
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.720]   God for what they had done, how the Lord had saved them.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:12:00.200]   And when they ate together, they also remembered and reflected upon their sins and what they
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.360]   had done wrong.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.120]   Not only was there vertical fellowship with the Lord, there was horizontal fellowship
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:15.920]   with each other as they dined together with all these festivals.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:21.000]   So that is the Old Testament, just a short glimpse of some of the things that they did
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   in the Old Testament.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.920]   We're going to look at the New Testament, and there's a famous New Testament story.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.440]   There was a wedding.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.240]   There was a wedding, and Jesus was attending with his mother.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:41.720]   And you know how sometimes mothers are like, "Come on, son, do this," or "Do that."
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.520]   Anybody have a mother that sort of nudges?
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.520]   Yeah?
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.520]   Are you talking about Sandra?
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:47.520]   No?
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.960]   Okay, okay.
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:56.280]   Sometimes there's a mother that sort of nudges, "Sit properly," or "Fix your hair," or "Don't
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.000]   do this," or "Don't do that."
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.200]   And Jesus was at this wedding, and Mary was like, "Jesus, they're kind of running out
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.320]   of wine here.
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.960]   And if you don't have wine in a wedding, what's going to happen?
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.960]   You've run out of wine.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.840]   What's going to happen?"
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.240]   It's sort of embarrassing, right?
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.600]   It's an embarrassment to the hosts, and people are probably just going to start going home.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.160]   Pastor John's going to start going home, right?
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.960]   That's what he said.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.200]   And so Jesus was like, look at this statement.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.760]   "Woman, what does this have to do with me?
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.520]   My hour has not yet come."
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.980]   And his mother was like, "Just do whatever Jesus tells you."
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:49.340]   And so Jesus sees these six stone jars, okay?
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.040]   They're huge jars holding 20 to 30 gallons.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.960]   They're huge.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.880]   And do you know what these gallons or these stone jars, the water within them, are used
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   for?
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.040]   What are they used for?
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   Well, it says here, it says for purification, all right?
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.040]   Purification.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.480]   So what would they wash?
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.600]   They wash their feet, right?
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.960]   Anybody have smelly feet that they need to wash?
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:19.680]   Don't tell me, I don't need to know.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.840]   But imagine their dirty feet, right?
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.040]   They're wearing sandals.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.320]   They're walking through the mud.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.800]   You think they had cement, you know, pavements back then?
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   They didn't.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   It was maybe...
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   Maybe it rained, right?
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.080]   And it's raining and they're walking, you know?
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.880]   And so they arrived to the wedding.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:37.280]   Of course, they need to wash, right?
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.780]   To the temple, they wash.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:45.040]   And Jesus said to the servants, "Fill the jars with water."
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.160]   And they filled them to the brim.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:55.680]   And he said to them, "Now draw some water and take it to the master of the feast."
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.680]   And they took it.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.200]   Can you imagine those servants?
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   They take...
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   It should be water filled.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   Should I take it to the master?
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.680]   Do you think it turned to wine right at the stone?
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:19.920]   Or do you think they needed some sort of faith to walk and go towards the master?
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.600]   And they give it to the master.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.840]   And the master says...
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.840]   What does he say?
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.240]   "Everyone serves the good wine first.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:39.120]   And when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine, that you have kept the good wine
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.800]   until now."
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.160]   Jesus ate with these people.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.640]   He participated with these people.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.200]   He kept the party going.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.280]   That's what Jesus did.
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.240]   He kept the party going.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:03.920]   It was about to die down and he was like, "I'm going to resurrect this party to life."
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.000]   So Jesus ate with the people.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.120]   He had horizontal fellowship with these people.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:18.800]   Not only did he have dinners and wedding banquets, he also reclined with people that weren't
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   so popular.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:26.440]   We'll see in the next verse, he ate at a Levite's house.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.880]   And there was a large company of tax collectors there.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:35.320]   Tax collectors, they have a special word, sinners and tax collectors.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.760]   That's how bad they were.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.120]   These were people that betrayed us.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.680]   They're working for the Romans.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.280]   They're tax collectors.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:49.560]   Jesus also ate at the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:55.840]   And so we see here from Jesus, the lessons to be learned is that he kept the party going.
[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.280]   He kept the wedding going.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.360]   There was horizontal connection.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.920]   He attended these dinners with people that believed in him and also people that needed
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.520]   him.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:18.240]   He had horizontal connection and he also invites us to vertical worship and connection when
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.120]   he invites us to his dinner.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.120]   And that is communion.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:31.320]   And in Luke chapter 22, it says this, "He took bread and when he had given thanks, he
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:37.000]   broke it and said to them, 'This is my body broken for you.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.360]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:47.080]   And likewise, the cup that they had, he said this, 'This cup that is poured out for you
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.840]   is the new covenant in my blood.'"
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:58.760]   Jesus invites us to a dinner that connects with himself.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.080]   A vertical connection with the Lord himself.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:10.840]   And when we partake in communion, we are united with Christ.
[00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:19.720]   We are united because we eat his flesh and we drink his blood, which represents his body
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:26.380]   sacrificed for us and his blood poured out for us for sins.
[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:35.040]   When we partake in communion, we are united as a body of Christ, horizontally with each
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.160]   other.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:45.160]   It says in 1 Corinthians, "Because there is one loaf, we who are many are one body, for
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.640]   we share in that one loaf."
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:55.040]   We are saved because of one person, one body, one sacrifice.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:02.720]   In communion, we are connected with each other as children of God.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.920]   And lastly, in communion, we are united in hope.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.760]   And what is our hope?
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.400]   What is our hope?
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.280]   Our hope is not just in this world.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.080]   Our hope isn't in the stock market that it will do wonders for us.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.200]   It's going up and down, up and down, right?
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.400]   Or down for John.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.360]   That's what he said, not me.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:35.560]   Our hope is that one day God will come again and that there will be a new heaven and a
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.720]   new earth.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.680]   We're not made for this world.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.840]   We are made for eternity.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.480]   Eternity.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:53.360]   And in communion, we are taking part in eternity.
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.480]   And we're going to look at eternal times now, our eternal testaments.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.520]   Let's look at Isaiah chapter 25.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:06.600]   Isaiah, the prophet, prophesied this about eternity, about heaven.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:12.920]   On this mountain, the Lord of hosts will make all peoples a feast of rich food, a feast
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:19.480]   of well-aged wine, a rich food full of marrow, of aged wine and well-refined.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.480]   Wow.
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.680]   This sounds like a good menu.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.240]   You guys salivating already?
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.280]   Good wine, good food, rich food.
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.280]   Wow.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:37.240]   In eternity, we're going to eat with the Lord on his mountain.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.920]   Wow.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.480]   Let's look at Revelations, what it says.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:49.200]   Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of the great multitude.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   Great multitude.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:56.120]   Imagine just a great multitude of people in heaven, all gathered together.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.640]   What are they doing?
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   This is what they say.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.640]   Hallelujah.
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.760]   For the Lord, our God, the Almighty reigns.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:09.040]   Let us rejoice and exalt and give him the glory for the marriage of the lamb has come
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.680]   and his bride has made herself ready.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.600]   And the angel said to me, "Write this.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:23.120]   Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb."
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.840]   In heaven, we're going to be feasting with the Lord.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:41.160]   The marriage supper of the lamb, celebrating us being in eternity with the Lord because
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.680]   of what he's done.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.480]   And when does eternity start?
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.680]   When does eternity start?
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:53.880]   In John chapter 17, verse 3, it says this.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:22:04.200]   Now this is eternal life, that they know you, the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.080]   have sent.
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:16.640]   When you know Jesus, eternity starts.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.560]   Do you know Jesus?
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:28.520]   Because if you know Jesus, eternity has started.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:34.040]   What can we learn from eternity?
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:38.400]   These passages of eternity in the Bible.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:43.920]   We see here that there's this triangle, right?
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.900]   Horizontal is human to human connection.
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:55.080]   And then God, as we, as Christians and followers of God, as we get closer to God, what happens
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.680]   in this triangle?
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.880]   What happens?
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:05.960]   As we get closer to God, we become closer to each other.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.840]   Does that make sense?
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.720]   That's how a triangle works.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.520]   Just so you know, if you're awake.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:21.700]   As we get closer to God, as we become more like Jesus Christ, as the Holy Spirit is working
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:32.200]   within us, reminding us to repent and to become more like him, molding us, sanctifying us,
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:38.040]   we become closer to God and we become closer to each other.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:44.760]   Just like in 1 John, it said, when we read before, we have fellowship with God and with
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.520]   each other.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:57.680]   This is where the horizontal fellowship connection meets the vertical connection.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:07.640]   Table fellowship can be viewed as a rehearsal for eternal fellowship.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:14.120]   Table fellowship can be viewed as a rehearsal for eternal fellowship.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.720]   When believers gather together with the Holy Spirit inside of them and their bodies as
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:29.200]   the temple of God to do the will of the Lord, each table fellowship we take can be considered
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:34.800]   a step towards eternity.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:41.440]   When there is both vertical and horizontal connection, we edge closer in our relationship
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:45.880]   with God and with each other.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:53.160]   Table fellowship can be regarded as an eternal action.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:25:04.000]   The importance of eating together as Christians gather is that it's not just temporary.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.240]   We're doing something eternal.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.980]   We're spending time with people that will be in heaven.
[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.540]   We're connecting with God and praying for the food.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:29.200]   We're spending time with each other as a step towards eternity, a rehearsal for eternal
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   fellowship.
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:43.520]   That one day, that amazing marriage supper of the Lamb, we are going towards that.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.000]   This table, if you look at it from a bird's eye view, you'll see it.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.080]   What will you see?
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.080]   You'll see it in the next slide.
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.320]   It's a point.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:00.800]   That's the point I'm trying to make.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:08.400]   That as we go closer to God and to each other, we will arrive.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:20.960]   We're arriving closer and closer to that eternal marriage supper of the Lamb.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:25.760]   I'm going to end with a story.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.800]   The story is this.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.960]   Everybody knows what I like to play.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.960]   What do I like to play?
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.960]   Basketball.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.480]   I play basketball at the basketball court.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:41.840]   Everybody knows me so well.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:50.120]   I was playing basketball with a high school student and he brought a friend.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.800]   We started playing ball together more and more.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.280]   So what happened was this.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:03.280]   I was like, "Hey, you want to grab dinner sometime?"
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.520]   Who do you usually eat with?
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.680]   I know in Hong Kong it's so small, you're basically eating with everybody in the restaurant.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.760]   But usually you eat with people you know, that you're friends with, that you connect
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.200]   well with.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:20.360]   I felt like, "Okay, we've been playing ball for so long together.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.360]   Let's go eat."
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:23.680]   So we ate together.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.640]   That started a friendship.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:33.360]   There was this one time, he was in high school, and we started a friendship.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.000]   He was like, "What are you doing tomorrow?"
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.520]   I'm like, "I'm going to camp, to church camp."
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.720]   He's like, "Oh, I like camp."
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.200]   So I'm like, "Well, why don't you come?"
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.200]   I call up Carmen.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.960]   I'm like, "Yo, there's this kid.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.520]   He wants to come to camp tomorrow."
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.400]   It's a youth camp.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.920]   He signs up, and he comes to camp.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.640]   And slowly he gets to know God more.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.560]   And I invite him out.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.520]   We hand out food boxes every week, and I invite him out because he likes to help out.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:12.820]   And I invite him out to our fellowship time, and he starts coming to fellowship every week.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:18.500]   He starts coming to hand out boxes every other week, food boxes every other week.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:27.160]   And three months later, I decided, I was like, "I'm going to fully share the gospel with
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   him."
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:32.600]   And so we go to, we play basketball, and then afterwards we have dinner together.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.400]   And so there's the three of us, and we have dinner together.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.940]   And then afterwards, I'm just like, "Hey, I want to share something with you."
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.700]   And I draw the gospel for him.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:54.400]   And I explain it fully to him, and I explain fully how Jesus is our only way to eternity.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:00.820]   And through this meal, he asked Jesus into his life.
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:10.380]   And so what started off was an introduction meal, became regular fellowship, and then
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:19.860]   became a rehearsal for eternal fellowship because he asked Jesus into his life, and
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:25.460]   that's the beginning of eternal life.
[00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:35.220]   And so my question to you as we look at this empty table is, who do you want to invite
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.300]   to this table?
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:43.420]   Who do you want to invite to this table?
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:48.860]   As the worship band comes up, I'm going to ask us to reflect on who has God placed in
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.200]   your life?
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:59.140]   Maybe it's a business person, it's a coworker, maybe it's a fellow student in your life.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:04.400]   Maybe these people are struggling, or maybe they're lonely.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:10.260]   Maybe you're good friends with them and you have dinner regularly.
[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:20.420]   How will you use the table to lead people towards eternity?
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:30.820]   How will you use the table the Lord has given you to lead people towards eternity?
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:39.560]   Maybe it's your relative because there's a holiday coming up and it's a family holiday.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:50.260]   Maybe this is the time to use the table, the dinner table fellowship as an opportunity
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:56.100]   to lead them closer towards eternity.
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:11.980]   Let us take a moment to reflect, and then we will respond with a song later.
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:29.580]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the examples you've taught us in the Bible.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.620]   Feasting is not just about food.
[00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:34.060]   It can be so much more.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:42.060]   It can be about horizontal fellowship with each other, and ultimately vertical fellowship
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.060]   with you.
[00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:49.140]   I thank you, Lord, for the different people that you've placed in our lives.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:56.380]   Give us spiritual eyes, Lord, that we might see the needs of the people, and that we might
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:05.220]   use this table as a tool to lead them one step closer towards eternity.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.700]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.460]   Amen.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:18.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
