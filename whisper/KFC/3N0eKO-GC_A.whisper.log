[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.600]   Good evening. How are you all today? Good? All right. It's great to be here. I love sharing
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.780]   a message where I can see you and you can see me physically here. I think it's a blessing
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.000]   that we're able to do that tonight. And today I do have a very special message that I want
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.020]   to share with you all because a lot of times we might think that as a Christian, we might
[00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.400]   just get by day to day. But in fact, we are able to be more than conquerors and we can
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.160]   be victors that do not compromise. So I don't know, maybe some of you have believed in God
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.960]   for a short time and maybe some of you have believed for a much longer time. And maybe
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.040]   you've read the Bible, you've heard the sermon, and you've even tried to apply it to your
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:02.020]   life. But don't you wonder for a moment sometimes, am I doing it right? And when I say doing
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:10.240]   it right, am I worshiping God in a way that is pleasing to him? Or am I missing something?
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.260]   And tonight, while we get to share this message together and hear from the Lord, it's a chance
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.260]   for us to reexamine and realign. So it's kind of like our midyear review. Now, who looks
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.580]   forward to our midyear reviews here? Anybody? All right, that's what I thought, okay? I
[00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.580]   might be the only one who is, Pastor John. Now, we don't look forward to midyear reviews.
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.060]   Why? Because we don't really want to know what we're not doing right or we don't really
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.380]   want to know what more we have to do. But you know what? You might want to dismiss that
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.100]   appointment and you might want to kind of call in sick that day. But I want to say tonight
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.220]   that we're going to do a midyear review with our Christian walk and our worship. And I
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.620]   want to say you don't want to miss that because we don't want to get to the end of our lives
[00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.820]   thinking that we've worshipped God exactly the way that he wanted us to and pleased him
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.740]   and only to find out he tells us otherwise at that time. So tonight we get to do that
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.540]   with the Word of God, with revelation, which we have been looking at over the few weeks
[00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.340]   and we'll be doing that for the remaining few weeks as well, where we get to see Jesus
[00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.100]   speaking to his church and telling us how we're doing. So I don't know, is that going
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:46.100]   to make everybody excited right now? All right. So let's begin by reading these verses. It's
[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:55.060]   up on here. From Revelation chapter 2, verse 12 to 13. "And to the angel of the church
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.820]   in Pergamum write the words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword. I know where you
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:11.060]   dwell, where Satan's throne is, yet you hold fast my name and you did not deny my faith,
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:19.340]   even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness who was killed among you where Satan dwells."
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.780]   And now we can see from Apostle John where he records that this letter is written to
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:34.900]   the church of Pergamum. Now we are not sure right now in this moment what or who this
[00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.860]   person is that's telling the church because all we have is this description of him, which
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.700]   is someone holding on the sharp two-edged sword. Now we look throughout the Bible, there
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.580]   are different places where they mentioned the two-edged sword and it is actually the
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:58.500]   meaning of the word of God where he cuts and he examines and he will judge. And so we can
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   be quite sure to say that this letter was in fact from Jesus himself to the church.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.340]   But even if we have answered that question, I mean, why is it Satan's throne? And so it
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.220]   seems like they're holding fast to his name and who's Antipas anyways? And why is it keep
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.380]   talking about Satan dwells there? So now we're going to dig a little bit deeper into the
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.740]   background and I just want to let you know where Pergamum is. And it's actually located
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.540]   in Turkey today, it's called Pergamum. And so, Pergamum, it's all these names that are
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.660]   very similar. And so what we find is that if we look, Pergamum at that time, which is
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.540]   first and second century, it should look something like this. And it's actually quite a beautiful
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:54.660]   city if we look at it. It's built on top of a hill and it's got its own buildings. And
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.100]   in here, we actually have a library that has over 200,000 volumes. Now at that time, they
[00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.780]   were written by hand. Okay, so this is a massive library, which means that this city is actually
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:15.820]   has a lot of knowledge. But it's not famous for that, actually. It's famous for being
[00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:23.540]   a place where people would worship pagan gods, where people from all around the Asia, minor
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.260]   Asia, they're going to come and they're going to worship these gods. And that's why Jesus
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.460]   is calling this place Satan's throne. Now I just want to show you a few pictures of
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.060]   what it is like. So right now on the right hand side, you're going to see Pergamum. These
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.420]   are the remains of it and also the floor plan. Don't worry, I'm not an architect and we're
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.260]   not about to go to the details of this. But I do want to show you what a massive amount
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.620]   of temples that they have here. This is the Pergamum altar, which now we can still find
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:03.100]   parts of it and reconstruct it in Berlin. And we can also see the temple of Dianosys.
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:08.160]   Is that how it's pronounced? I'm not sure. And then we also see the temple of Athena.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:15.960]   This one I can pronounce. And also the temple of Trajan. Now why I want to stop here for
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.340]   a moment, because this is actually a temple not for gods, a mytholic god. This one is
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.980]   actually one that was for a living emperor. So at that time, they already began to worship
[00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.540]   human beings. And this one, as you can see, is actually much more monumental to the other
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.540]   ones that we just saw. And so I won't go through the whole list, as you can see. There are
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:46.620]   at least eight temples that are there at Pergamum. Now why do I need to tell you all this background?
[00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.460]   Well because at that time, those were the people that the Christians were surrounded
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:59.700]   with. They wanted to worship other gods. And so here the Bible is telling us that if you
[00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:05.580]   were Christian at that time, they were situated in a place where they were surrounded by all
[00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.900]   these pagan worship. And as a Christian, if you had to live out your faith at that time,
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.260]   you would be boycotted easily. And also because they were worshipping emperors, which meant
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:24.860]   if you didn't make a sacrifice to him, that would have been what happened. And as we see
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:32.980]   here, actually Antipas stood up for his faith. And this is what had happened to him, that
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:41.580]   he had been this faithful witness, and yet he was killed. He was martyred. And we can
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:47.540]   see that Jesus is actually applauding this church for doing such a great job because
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:55.060]   there were people who were willing to stand up for their faith, even in this tough situation.
[00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.820]   And if you want to review more, we actually had a great sermon preached by Pastor Johnny
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:06.380]   last week, and you can see how it is that we can withstand persecutions at this time,
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:13.900]   when it's hard, when it's tough. But in here, what we can see is that Jesus is telling the
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.540]   church, "You're doing a great job. You're persevering. You're keeping my name. It's
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:30.020]   all good." Okay? Now, what does it have to do with us? I mean, hopefully we're not professing
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.940]   our faith in such a way that we might be persecuted and then we have to die or be executed, and
[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:43.500]   we don't, and we thank God for it. But big or small, we are still making these sacrifices
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.740]   for God sometimes when we are being persecuted. And it might be from your family, if your
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:54.580]   family has a different belief, and if you try to stand up to them, they might give you
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:01.540]   a hard time. Or it might be your colleagues, or it might be your friends. And so big or
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:09.180]   little, we might be doing that. However, God's really telling us here that persevering in
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:15.900]   the midst of persecution is important, but it isn't complete yet. And he's about to tell
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.740]   us what is it that we're missing. Our mid-year review is coming. You know, they usually start
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:27.740]   with the good stuff, and now we get to the meat. So let's read this together. In verse
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:33.820]   14, "But I have a few things," not a lot, you know, just a few, "that I have to tell
[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:42.980]   you. You have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling
[00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:50.060]   block before the sons of Israel so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:10:00.540]   sexual immorality. So also, you have some who hold the teaching of Nicolaitan." I tried
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:07.780]   to practice that word, but it still didn't work out. And so what we see here is that
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:13.180]   Jesus is telling them, "Yes, you did great, but there's a few things." But when we look
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:18.700]   at this, I mean, what is this teaching of Balaam anyways? And what does eating food
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:24.060]   sacrificed to idol or sexual immorality, we might get, but what does it have to do with
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:31.940]   us? So what we see, if we look back into the Old Testament, Balaam was actually a pagan
[00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:38.940]   prophet, and he didn't believe in God, and he was hired by Balak, King Balak, which is
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:47.060]   a foreign king, and he told, I know there's all this Balaam, Balak. So Balak told Balaam
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:56.100]   that he had to curse the Israelites. But because God had prevented that from happening, instead,
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.540]   Balaam thought, "All right, I'll devise a plan. What I'm going to do is I'm going to
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:05.940]   get the foreign women to sleep with the men of Israel, and then to get them to worship
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:13.500]   the pagan gods, and then God, the real God, will be against them." And so Balaam, or the
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:21.620]   teachings of Balaam, actually means for us today that they have permitted a compromise,
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:27.660]   one that would mingle with the worldly or the pagan beliefs and action, and actually
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:34.420]   be away from God. So whenever we are referring to the teaching of Balaam or Nicolaitans,
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:43.780]   we actually mean it in this way, where it is a way to still continue to worship other
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:50.420]   gods. Now, let me put it in kind of like today's term, because we're not, we're like, "Who's
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.860]   Balaam? Balak?" You know, most of you might be thinking, at least I was when I was reading
[00:11:54.860 --> 00:12:01.700]   it. I mean, think about it this way. The church today, and it might be us too, what we're
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:08.580]   doing is we're professing to our friends, our family, that we are Christians. We are,
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:14.980]   and we're standing firm in our faith. But at the same time, it might be that we're continuing
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:22.220]   ways of thinking or actions that are no different than non-believers. And so we're holding hands
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:28.660]   together, one to God and one to the pagan gods. And we're like, "No, no, no, that's
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:33.060]   not me. I'm not holding anybody's, wait, I'm holding on God's hand, but I'm not holding
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.840]   on that hand." But I mean, as we read a little bit more, we can all examine to see
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:45.500]   whether or not we are holding hands to the world and to the pagan gods. And so one of
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.900]   the things that they've told us here is that they were eating these food that were sacrificed
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:56.580]   to idols. Okay? Now we're like, "What does, again, what does that have to do with us?
[00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:02.060]   Are we going to go to the restaurant and ask, 'Has this steak been sacrificed to idols?'"
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:06.540]   I mean, we're not going to do that, and it's not teaching us to do that here. But what
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:13.700]   it is saying is, are we separating something that's as neutral as food? Because food is
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:21.780]   neutral. But are we separating that and consecrating it and saying that this is for the Lord, this
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:28.780]   is for the Lord, and this is not? And if we are, then we're setting apart some of the
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.640]   things that are happening in our lives, and those might be people and those might be things
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:39.220]   in our lives that we're not giving to God. And instead, whenever we're not giving it
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:49.680]   to God, we're giving it to pagan gods, the world. And so what we find is that when this
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:57.540]   really represents us compromising at times and going with the world. And the second block
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:05.020]   or second stumbling block that it talks about here is that they practice sexual immorality.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:11.980]   And in here, it can mean both things, actually physically practicing or metaphorically, they
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:20.100]   are also following idols or ways of doing things as the non-believers. So anyhow, the
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:26.580]   teaching of Balaam is trying to tell us that whenever it is that we're professing that
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:34.580]   we are Christians, but at the same time, we're still following the world, then we're actually
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:43.580]   having these sacrifice idols or we're worshipping these idols. So now in here, we really need
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:50.160]   to examine ourselves. I mean, are we still following the world or not? I don't know.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:55.820]   That's a rhetorical question for you. But as we dig deeper later in the third session,
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:02.900]   we'll see and you can do a further examination. So what we see here is that Jesus is trying
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:09.500]   to tell us, purge, take away all of these idolatrous compromises in your life. You can't
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:17.780]   be both believers of Christians and also still be eating these sacrifices that has been sacrificed,
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.500]   these foods have been sacrificed to other gods. You can't do that. You can't believe
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:30.060]   in God and at the same time, still have these sexual immoralities in your life. And so as
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:38.300]   we read on, Jesus says, "Therefore, repent. If not, I will come to you and war against
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:44.180]   them with the sword of my mouth." Again, we're seeing that Jesus is not going to take it
[00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.700]   and say, "All right, you know, have your own time." He says he will come and he will come
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:56.740]   to us, the people, whoever it is, that are still holding on both things, that are still
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:02.820]   worshipping other gods. And so we need to ask ourselves again, are we those people?
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:09.260]   Because if we are, Jesus says himself will come against us. I don't know about you, but
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:17.860]   I definitely don't want Jesus to be coming against me. And as we read on, he says, "He
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:25.460]   who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers,
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:32.980]   I will give some of the hidden manna and I will give him a white stone with a new name
[00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:40.900]   written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it." Now here we can
[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:47.700]   see that God's not saying, "I'm just going to come if you're not going to do what is
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:56.740]   rightful," but instead he's telling us, "No, no, no, but, but, but, if you would listen
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:04.580]   and repent, I have something in store for you. I have something for you, a promise,
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:09.860]   a reward." Now I don't know about you, but I'm very much into rewards. Whenever there's
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:15.860]   like a rewards point app, I get that and I try to get as many points as I can. And I
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.460]   mean, if I'm going to get any points, I think this is the app I want to get with God, you
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:24.340]   know, let's see how I'm going to get these points. And really he's telling us, "You're
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.820]   going to get great stuff, okay?" And the very first thing that he tells us is this hidden
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:34.620]   manna. We're like, "What is manna anyways?" Manna is actually this honey bread that God
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:42.420]   himself produced supernaturally for the Israelites when they exit, when they exited Egypt and
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:48.220]   they went into the promised land. Now it has been said that some of it has been stored
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:56.540]   with the ark and it's now, it will be restored at the end time. And so for him to say that
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:02.580]   you will get some of those hidden manna means that you will be part of that end time. You
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:09.300]   will, you will be restored at the time when the ark is as well. And at the same time,
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:18.300]   this manna also could represent a chance for us to banquet with, not a chance, but definitely
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:24.980]   a chance, definitely going to banquet with our King. Because at the end time, Jesus says
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:32.740]   that he would have a banquet of the lamb where he is going to come and take his bride, which
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:40.020]   is his church. And so what we see is if we reject the food contrasted earlier, that was
[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:46.220]   being sacrificed to the idols, we will get this hidden manna, which is from God, and
[00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:55.780]   we'll get to feast with him in this end time. And that is a wonderful reward to have. And
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.860]   secondly, he also mentioned a white stone. I brought a white stone here. I brought a
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:05.660]   white, I'm not sure if it's like this or if it's a gigantic one, but you know, I got one
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.860]   here. It's a white stone. And he says that there will be a name written on it. There's
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:16.540]   something written on it. It's not my name. And, and so what does a white stone mean?
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:21.820]   Well, in those time, actually they had a lot of athletes and they would compete. And if
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:28.300]   you won, if you have the victor, you actually get a white stone. And what that really is,
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:33.060]   it's like a medal that you get in Olympic games. It means that you can tell the whole
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:41.620]   world I've won, I'm a victor. And so this stone represents that. And at the same time,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:49.660]   in those days, when you have to attend any of the public assemblies that were restricted,
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:56.460]   actually this, a pebble would serve as the admission ticket. So the stone actually also
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:03.140]   has the admission ticket meaning. And it's really saying to us that we'll get a white
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:09.660]   stone that says we're victors. And this stone allows us, it gives us a ticket, a mission
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:18.160]   to this supper that we'll have with the Lord. And white has another meaning. In the book
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:25.140]   of Revelation is constantly mentioned as righteousness. So here it's really telling us that this is
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:36.140]   not a regular stone like this one on my hand. It represents so much and I want this reward.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:42.860]   And so in the third thing, or the second, but then it's engraved, it's a new name. Now
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.660]   it says that nobody knows what it is. So don't even bother asking me what it is because I
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:54.420]   don't know. But what we do name is what a name represents. And it's telling us it's
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:59.700]   a new name. Now in those days when somebody knew your name, it meant that they knew you
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:06.340]   personally. It is an intimate fellowship. So in here it's telling us this new name means
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:13.060]   we're going to have an intimate fellowship with Christ. And also when you're given a
[00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:20.940]   new name, the giver of that name, or you actually belong to the person who gives you that name
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:28.140]   and you share the character as well as their power. So I know for us, we're like, it's
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:34.860]   easier to grasp if I say that Jesus will give you a 2000 square feet flat, that'll be very
[00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:43.580]   easy for you to understand. But if Jesus says these are valuable to us, I want to let you
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:50.100]   know that it must be so much more valuable than anything that you could ever imagine.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:55.220]   I know for us, we're like, oh, it's just a banquet. Sometimes I eat too much there anyways,
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:03.460]   right? But this one is going to be with the Lord in end times and you don't want to miss
[00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:13.100]   it. And so today I actually want to share a testimony of mine with you as well. I mean,
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:17.900]   to put all these into context, because we're looking at revelation. We hardly understand
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:24.660]   half of the words or terms and we try to, and yet what does it really mean for us? How
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:30.940]   do I let go of that hand even if I wanted to? So I want to share a bit of my story with
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:40.300]   you, which is a while back, maybe more than a few years back. I was in a stage where I
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:45.700]   was a professing Christian and I had been for the last maybe 20 years at that time.
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:51.340]   Mind you again, I believed when I was really, really young. And so I was hanging on to God
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:57.180]   and I was going to church. I was going to small groups and all of those. And I felt
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.780]   like, oh, I felt pretty good. I felt like a good Christian. But at the same time, I
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.860]   also realized I was still hanging on to the world. Why do I say that? Well, I did meet
[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:14.180]   a guy. Okay, now everybody wakes up when I say that. So I did meet a guy, right? And
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:19.140]   you know, he seemed to have everything together. I mean, all the things that the world would
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:25.780]   like. I mean, he was not bad looking. He was relatively tall and, you know, he owned his
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:33.500]   own business, which at that time was about to be IPO'd in a few years. And he owned cars
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:42.260]   and a number of properties. And not only that, but he was actually nice to me. And not only
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.060]   that, you would have thought, you know, guess how old this guy is, right? I mean, he was
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:53.980]   only my age too. So I mean, it seemed to have almost everything. And then, of course, I
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:59.100]   asked, oh, so are you a Christian? And you know, he says, yes, I believe in God. I'm
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:04.980]   like, oh, he believes in God. All right. It's like bingo, right? And then he says, oh, but
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.340]   I don't go to church. I'm like, oh, okay, you don't go to church. I thought, that's
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:14.700]   all right. Everything else seems pretty good, you know. I can compromise on, you know, not
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:19.420]   going to church that much. But whenever I went, you know, he would go too. So I'm like,
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:27.180]   okay, everything is good. And you know, a few months in, he started asking or wanting
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:34.900]   to get more intimate. And when I meant that, he actually asked to want to have sex during
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:44.820]   a time when we were just dating. And at that time, it was another thing to think about.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:51.820]   Is one thing not to go to church, I can compromise with that. But this is sexual immorality.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:57.100]   And as a Christian girl, you know, all the alarm bells goes off. And what do you do with
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:08.900]   that? But all I had to do was to compromise. And if I compromise, everything else would
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:16.660]   be mine. Could be. I don't know. Nobody really knows, right? Could be. You wanted the car,
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:26.140]   you wanted the properties. How about being called the chairman's wife? That sounds good.
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:35.660]   And so what I realized was my heart was worshiping pagan gods. I love those things. I love the
[00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:41.100]   money. I love the prestige. I love the status that it would bring to me, not to mention
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:56.540]   the person. I loved everything. But there was a price. That's a price. Just one compromise.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:04.780]   I suppose you want to know the ending of the story? So the ending of the story is that
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:14.780]   I told him, I'm a Christian. This is beyond my compromise. And that either we would get
[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:22.340]   married or we'll continue to date, but then you would stop pressuring me into it. And
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.500]   so that didn't quite work for him. And it's understandable. I don't want to say that this
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:34.620]   is a bad person or anything. But that it was simply not a good fit. Because I, myself,
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:39.820]   was actually torn between the two. It was actually me that had the problem. Not him.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:47.740]   He was living his life. But me. And so eventually I told him that we would break up. And we
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:56.740]   did. And I think it was then that I really broke down in front of God. And I asked him,
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:06.900]   I said, God, why? I've been a Christian all my life. All my life. And what's happening?
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.420]   Why is it that I'm still loving this world? It's not like I even want to. I want to love
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:17.060]   you and you only. But I still love these things. I still want to go. And it's heartbreaking
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:27.260]   for me at that time. Why? And I realized it was because I was worshipping the pagan gods.
[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:33.340]   I was eating the sacrifice food. Food was neutral, remember? These things are neutral.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.940]   I'm not saying, you know, if you meet somebody like that and he's a Christian, love God,
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:43.660]   go ahead. Okay? Not saying that. But what I am saying is that those things were actually
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:50.580]   tying me down. They were my bondages and I can't get rid of them. And when I asked God
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:56.940]   what's happening, that's the answer he told me. Or that's what he revealed to me. That
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:03.900]   I still loved all these things after being a Christian. And that's exactly what's happening
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:15.540]   in this church. That we're looking at Pergamum. They love God, but they also love the world.
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:22.300]   If they didn't, they wouldn't be eating those food to begin with. But they still loved it.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:28.940]   And so after the prayer that I had with God, God started to transform me. And I mean, and
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.700]   it's in progression. I mean, it's not like one day I'm suddenly different. Maybe for
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:39.060]   some of you that's possible. But for me, it was a progression of a number of years. And
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:45.860]   throughout those years, God did a heart surgery and he changed my perspective. And I was slowly
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:57.180]   able to let go of this world, of the pagans, of this worship. And I wanted to tell you
[00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:08.220]   that the Lord himself tastes so good. And it's so good to only be holding hands with
[00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:13.820]   the Lord. Because all those things and whatever it is, we think Jesus is posting like another
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:20.380]   rule for us. It's not. It's God loving us. Because the only way that we could truly taste
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:29.500]   his goodness, if we hold double hands to him, not one, but both. And so he allowed me to
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:34.900]   really taste his goodness to a point where I say, God, I really want to tell others about
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:42.060]   it. And so he allowed me to go to seminary to study and to become a pastor. And of course,
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:48.940]   here I am standing. I can't even believe that it's happening, but it is. And I want to say
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:55.220]   it's not me. Okay. It's definitely not me. Because throughout those years, I still held
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:30:01.740]   on. It was because of God's grace that he delivered me. And today I want to say that
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:08.660]   he's given me a new system, new value system, one that is dependent on him, one that wants
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:20.020]   to please him. And of course, he let me meet another man. This is when you wake up again.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:25.820]   Let me meet another man. And this time it's different. I mean, he might not be the tallest
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:37.900]   person, but hey, I'm short. Okay. So no problem for me. It's all about a good match. But he
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:44.780]   is someone who loves the Lord and who honors him and who takes his teaching and put it
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:53.060]   into a priority. And he is someone who has the fruit of the spirit, loving kindness,
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:31:00.380]   gentle, and a very willing heart to love me. Willing in the sense he's going to wait until
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:09.300]   after marriage before we get intimate. Right? And that's love in God. And even yesterday
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.180]   when I was preparing for this, he's able to give me feedbacks in terms of how to make
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:20.180]   it even better. And even as I asked him, is it okay for me to share this testimony? And
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:28.740]   he's supportive of that. And I believe that he has all the characteristics that I would
[00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:38.820]   find to build a God-centered, God-honoring family. And I believe that it's all these
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:45.540]   things that are important. But when we were holding on and worshiping other gods, we can't
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:32:02.980]   help but not see that. And, oh, maybe I should show you a photo of him. His name is Philemon.
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:12.740]   And he's my fiance now. And if, I mean, when, if God permits, we'll be getting married in
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:24.860]   January. So. And really, I mean, friends, what is it that I want to say to you today?
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:29.660]   This is not a dating 101 class. Okay? Maybe some of you are like, wait a minute, I'm way
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:39.900]   past that. What I do want to say, though, is that this is how we worship our God. With
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:47.820]   our relationships, with our career, with our family, with everything that we own, our money,
[00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:56.340]   and everyone in our lives. And if we were true to use this church, Pergamon, to examine
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:01.100]   ourselves, we'll see that maybe there are some parts we're not giving. For example,
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:08.260]   I mean, if we wanted to, if we were worshiping our pagan gods, okay, what would it look like
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:15.580]   as a career? We will want to climb the corporate ladder. For what? So we can make more money,
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:20.980]   be more prestigious, and people would envy us, and we can have nice cars, and maybe nice
[00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:28.440]   apartment, right? But if we were to say, no, I'm not going to sacrifice, I'm not going
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:35.180]   to worship the pagan gods with my career. I'm going to worship it with my God. What's
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:41.180]   that going to look like? It means that I'm going to do my very best and have the best
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:45.940]   integrity. I'm going to go on time. I know that's hard for some of us. I'm going to go
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:52.460]   on time. I'm going to give 100% even when you're working at home, okay? Because of COVID.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:59.300]   Why is nobody laughing? I guess you're all working really hard. Good. Or with the money
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:09.620]   that we make at this career, all of that, so then when we are excelling in our job,
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:14.180]   our co-worker is going to ask, why are you doing all this? Nobody's looking. And we can
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:20.980]   say, I do it for him. And he gets the glory. And that's how it is that we don't have to
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:27.180]   worship those pagan gods with our career, but we can worship God with it. And same thing
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:35.860]   for those who have children or grandchildren. How is it that we can worship our God? Instead
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:40.660]   of like worshiping the pagan gods, what would we do? We'll try to get them into the best
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:44.740]   school and then look at our friends. Did you get into that school? Oh no, I got mine into
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:51.740]   that school. Or we might be looking to see, are they achieving? And maybe their achievements
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:35:00.340]   become our achievements. And we feel really great about it. Or is it if we're going to
[00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:06.340]   worship God with our children or with your grandchildren, what would that look like?
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:11.100]   It would mean that I want to make sure that they're learning God's word. I want to make
[00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:18.020]   sure their character is built so that they are just like Jesus is. And I want to help
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:25.740]   them so that they can finish whatever will that God has for them. So you see, I don't
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:32.540]   know what it is that we might still be holding on or you might still be holding on with your,
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:39.100]   I'm using left hand, I suppose you can switch sometimes, that you're still hanging on. But
[00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:46.060]   what I do want to say is that we can examine and with our relationships, with our family,
[00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:54.940]   with our job, with our money, with everything that we have, let's not worship pagan gods
[00:35:54.940 --> 00:36:02.020]   with them. Let's not worship the world. Give those things to God and allow him to be the
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:14.300]   center of your lives and with all these things. And so today I really want to invite you to
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:22.300]   think, is there anything in your heart that's popping up now? Because one of the things
[00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:27.900]   that we need to do is we need to purge out anything, any pagan thoughts, any worldly
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:34.620]   thoughts or actions. It may actually include sexual immorality in your life too. And if
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:42.840]   that's the case, we need to purge that out. And also if we can't, we need to repent and
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:51.260]   just tell God, "God, I wanted to, I can't." Go to him every time, "I wanted to, I can't.
[00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:57.500]   Help me, God." And he is here to help us. And I wanted to say, if it weren't for the
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:02.540]   prayer, if it weren't for an answer to prayer of Jesus, like my life would not have been
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:11.340]   transformed. Probably not. But when we ask him, he is willing and he's powerful. He is
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:18.820]   the one that didn't only die on the cross for our sins, but he has resurrected and he
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:28.000]   has overcome not only sin, but death. And he can help us be overcomers, be victors.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:37.500]   He can help us so that we don't need to compromise, not even on one thing. And we don't compromise,
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:46.260]   not even on one thing. And we can ask Jesus to do that. And at the very end, of course,
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:51.020]   I'm not sure about you, but I'm going to try my very best to get these rewards. Okay? I've
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:54.940]   been getting all the rewards from all the other restaurants. So I figured I better get
[00:37:54.940 --> 00:38:04.180]   this one because it is the ultimate reward that we can get. The ones from Jesus are the
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:16.620]   best and he wants the best for us. So now, since we're going to be Christians, anyways,
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:25.980]   let's fight the good fight. Let's run the good race. Let's give it all that we have.
[00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:34.340]   Let's not compromise on even one thing. And this is what the Bible said, "He who has an
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:41.340]   ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the churches." And I pray that really, that
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:49.540]   all of us would be the ones who have ears because God's ready to help us and he has
[00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:56.020]   got those rewards stored for us. We just need to ask him. So let us pray together right
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:06.020]   now. May I ask all of you to stand? Let's stand and ask the God, our King, to help us.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:17.140]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you. You are the overcomer of all things and you are the
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:25.780]   one that's worthy of praises. And Father God, you knew who we were before you saved us,
[00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:33.260]   but you're still willing to pay the price, which is your life for us. And Father, you
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:40.580]   meant for it that in this life that we live in, that we would be conquerors and more.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:48.180]   This is what you have planned for us. And Father, when it is that we fall short, I pray
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:55.180]   and we pray together that your spirit would help us to change us, to transform us, to
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:40:01.660]   give us a new perspective, new ways of doing things, ones that would worship you, help
[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:09.140]   us repent, help us go to you. And Father, we know the ending of the story already, which
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:17.020]   is you are going to make us conquerors. You're going to make us victors. And so Father, we're
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:23.260]   hanging on to that truth, hanging on to your spirit and your power. And Father, we're going
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:31.860]   to say we're willing to give it all to you. Help us. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
