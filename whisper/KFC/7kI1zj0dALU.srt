1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
 One of my favourite people in the whole world is our own Paul Roth.

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,320
 I love him.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,920
 I think Mel does as well.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:30,480
 But in case you haven't noticed, I am British.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,480
 And he is Australian.

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,920
 Now there has always been a rivalry between the two nations, especially on the sports

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,240
 field.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:53,080
 And society, what society has done, has developed stereotypes of the people from both nations.

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:01,560
 Now I want to say that Paul and I do not fit these stereotypes.

10
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:08,560
 But many Aussies consider Brits to be rather stuck up.

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,160
 And quite frankly, boring.

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,200
 On the other hand, Brits consider Aussies to be crude.

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:28,320
 And dare I say, a little bit simple.

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,080
 If I was looking for evidence, which I am not, the following news report, which I read

15
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,240
 this week, seemed to support this argument.

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 In Brisbane, Australia, a rather silly thief was busted attempting to steal an in-car GPS

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,280
 system from a car that was equipped with an internal camera.

18
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,880
 If that fact alone is not enough, it turns out that the would-be car thief, being a true

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,960
 blue Aussie, had his name and date of birth tattooed on his neck, which was clearly visible

20
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,560
 to the cameras in the car.

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,640
 The hapless thief was arrested and jailed for seven months.

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,120
 I've called this talk Stop Thief.

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:37,360
 And in a sentence, the message of Ecclesiastes chapter 5 is, "Don't rob God, don't rob others,

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,320
 and don't rob yourself."

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,080
 Let me repeat them.

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,680
 Don't rob God, don't rob others, don't rob yourself.

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,160
 I want to take them one at a time.

28
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,500
 Let's look at the first one.

29
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,560
 Don't rob God.

30
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:03,840
 It starts off, verse 1, "Guard your steps when you go to the house of God."

31
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,600
 You may remember in the first four chapters of Ecclesiastes, the preacher has visited

32
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,680
 the courtroom, the marketplace, the highway, and the palace.

33
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,640
 And now he turns his attention to the temple.

34
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,000
 Now, the temple was a sacred place to the ancient Israelites.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,440
 It was the nerve center of religious activity.

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:38,200
 It was the symbol of the presence of God in the lives of the people of Israel.

37
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:46,340
 But the preacher noted that worshippers were not being sincere in their religious practices.

38
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,240
 They were taking the house of God for granted.

39
00:03:52,240 --> 00:04:01,620
 We, yes, us, would do well to mark these words.

40
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,780
 Guard your step.

41
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,500
 I have a question.

42
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:14,060
 How do we prepare for coming to worship?

43
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:21,220
 Are we running late, doing WhatsApp messages as we walk up the escalator?

44
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,740
 Is our mind even now on where we're going for dinner afterwards?

45
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:31,480
 I mean, should we go to Shake Shack or Five Guys?

46
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:37,180
 I remember going to church on Sunday morning with our kids when they were small.

47
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:43,600
 Our church was in Pop Falam, and we lived on the island south side.

48
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,220
 It was often like World War III even to get them into the car.

49
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,200
 And often the constant banter continued all the way to the church car park and even up

50
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,900
 to the door on the fourth floor.

51
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:05,180
 Then in a flash, the guitar and the drums started, and we were like, "Bless the Lord

52
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,180
 our God."

53
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,180
 Right?

54
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:16,920
 You know, my friends, the worship of God is the highest ministry of the church and must

55
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:23,600
 come from devoted hearts and yielded wills.

56
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:33,880
 Scottish Baptist minister Alexander McLaren wrote this, "Fruitful and acceptable worship

57
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,520
 begins before it begins."

58
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,560
 I say this, we guard our steps by preparing our hearts.

59
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,640
 Can I say it again?

60
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:54,880
 We guard our steps by preparing our hearts.

61
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,840
 Let's read on.

62
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:08,560
 To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know

63
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,280
 that they are doing evil.

64
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,760
 At that time, the time of Ecclesiastes, the time it was written, there was a prescribed

65
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,940
 system of temporal sacrifices.

66
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,640
 What happened was you sin, you sacrifice.

67
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,360
 You sin, you sacrifice.

68
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,800
 It was an endless circle, in fact.

69
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,220
 That circle was broken by Jesus.

70
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:45,000
 He fulfilled all sacrifices in his death on the cross.

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,640
 Thank goodness we don't have to come to church these days with a sheep or goat to be sacrificed.

72
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,800
 I mean, can you imagine coming up the escalator or worse still on the MTR?

73
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:09,060
 But if you study the Bible carefully, you will see that today, among other things, we

74
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,220
 are called to sacrifice.

75
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:20,240
 We are called to sacrifice to freely offer our bodies, our money, our possessions, and

76
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,480
 to always bring a sacrifice of praise.

77
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,800
 And look at that verse closely.

78
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:36,120
 To draw near to listen is better than to offer the sacrifice of fools.

79
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,880
 Other versions say, be more ready to hear.

80
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,040
 We are going to be reminded quite a bit in this chapter that we have two of these and

81
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,600
 one of these.

82
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:59,720
 And the caution is to use them in that proportion rather than the other way around.

83
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:07,640
 On the subject of sacrifice, you remember the story of Saul when God rejected him as

84
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
 king.

85
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,640
 Saul protested how much he had done for God.

86
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:21,960
 And Samuel told him this in 1 Samuel 15, "Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings

87
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,040
 and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord?

88
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:36,760
 Behold, to obey is better than to sacrifice."

89
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:48,400
 To obey is better than to sacrifice and to listen than the fat of rams.

90
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,760
 Sacrifices are not a substitute for obedience.

91
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,720
 And Ecclesiastes, in calling it the sacrifice of fools, tells us that only a fool could

92
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,480
 possibly think he can deceive God.

93
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,440
 Our mouths come in for some even more harsh treatment in the following verses.

94
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,520
 Listen to this.

95
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,600
 Do not be rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God,

96
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,680
 for God is in heaven and you're on earth.

97
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,720
 Therefore let your words be few.

98
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:38,840
 For a dream comes with much business and a fool's voice with many words.

99
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:46,560
 My friends, prayer is a serious business.

100
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:55,280
 When we pray, we should watch out for hasty words and dare I say, too many words.

101
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,440
 Now I'm speaking to myself here.

102
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:08,160
 Me and my big mouth often land me in deep water.

103
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,880
 The secret of acceptable prayer is a prepared heart.

104
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,960
 Let me say that again.

105
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:21,960
 The secret of acceptable prayer is a prepared heart.

106
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,520
 John Bunyan, the author of Pilgrim's Progress said this, "In prayer, it is better to have

107
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:34,480
 heart without words than words without heart."

108
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:43,640
 In chapter five, the preacher rightly describes the human tendency to speak without thinking

109
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,080
 before God and others.

110
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:54,000
 He reminds us, "It is foolish to speak too much and hear too little in God's presence."

111
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 I love verse three, "For a dream comes with much business and a fool's voice with many

112
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,680
 words."

113
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,120
 The thought in this line is well represented by the living Bible paraphrase.

114
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
 I love this.

115
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,120
 I'll put it on the screen.

116
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,720
 Just being too busy gives you nightmares.

117
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,960
 So being a fool makes you a blabbermouth.

118
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,840
 I'm talking to myself, I tell you.

119
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,680
 One of my favorite authors, N.T. Wright says this, "As personal and business cares produce

120
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:39,240
 dreams which are unsubstantial things, so many words produce foolish and empty prayers."

121
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:47,440
 Previous author and hymn writer, J. Edwin Orr, used to advise brief, earnest prayers,

122
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,520
 particularly in prayer meetings.

123
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:56,320
 He said this, "When one prays in a prayer meeting, for his first three minutes, everyone's

124
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,080
 praying with him.

125
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:06,400
 Should he pray for a second three minutes, everyone prays for him.

126
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:13,880
 Should he pray for a further three minutes, everyone's praying against him."

127
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:21,840
 Charles Spurgeon said, "It is not the length of our prayers, but the strength of our prayers

128
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,680
 that makes the difference."

129
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:34,360
 Now speaking as a fully paid up, represented, card carrying member of the Big Mouth Brigade,

130
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:43,520
 one of our major problems of talking too much is to make rash promises.

131
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:50,160
 And to put the next few verses into context, I need to tell you that God did not require

132
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,840
 his people to make vows to be accepted by him.

133
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,960
 But the opportunity to do so was there if they wanted to.

134
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,280
 So let's read on.

135
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:09,800
 When you make a vow before God, do not delay in paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools.

136
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,120
 Pay what you vow.

137
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,960
 It is better that you should not vow, that you should vow and not pay.

138
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:22,360
 Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger, "It was a

139
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,200
 mistake."

140
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,880
 Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?

141
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,200
 For when dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity.

142
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,520
 But God is the one you must fear.

143
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:46,800
 I believe a commonly overlooked and unappreciated sin amongst God's people is the sin of broken

144
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,040
 vows.

145
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,520
 Promising things to God and failing to live up to the vow.

146
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,560
 Those who honour God will not be quick to make vows to God, will be serious about fulfilling

147
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,800
 the vows they've made, and will regard broken vows as sins to be confessed and be to repented

148
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
 of.

149
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,680
 Verse 6 tells us, "Let not your mouth lead you into sin, and do not say before the messenger,

150
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,720
 'It was a mistake.'"

151
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,640
 The preacher rightly observed that it was important for God's people to regard their

152
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:32,000
 failure to keep vows as a serious matter, and to not regard the failure to keep them

153
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,200
 as simply an error.

154
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:43,480
 So many times in my pastoral ministry, have I come across people, usually people who come

155
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:51,160
 for healing or material blessing, who said, "If God does such and such a thing, I promise

156
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,320
 I'm going to do this thing.

157
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,720
 I promise I'm going to give to this cause.

158
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,600
 I'm going to be a missionary."

159
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,360
 But invariably these vows are empty.

160
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,840
 Their worship is not serious, so the vows have no value.

161
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:18,800
 Church, we rob God when we make a vow with no intention of keeping it.

162
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:26,000
 We also rob God when we delay keeping it, hoping to get out of it.

163
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,600
 But what we don't realise is when we rob God of worship and honour due to Him, we are depriving

164
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,200
 ourselves of the spiritual blessings He bestows.

165
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,120
 My friends, don't rob God.

166
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,800
 And then don't rob others.

167
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,240
 Let's read this.

168
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,960
 If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and

169
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,520
 righteousness, do not be amazed at the matter, for the high official is watched by a higher,

170
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,720
 and yet there are higher ones over them.

171
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:09,400
 But this is game for a land in every way, a king committed to cultivated fields.

172
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,060
 So we're moving now from the temple back to the city hall.

173
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,880
 And just as in chapters three and four, we witness the oppression of the poor and the

174
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,680
 violation of justice and righteousness.

175
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,760
 We're told to not be surprised at this.

176
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,480
 It was a commentary of a corrupt system.

177
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,440
 Those in power helping themselves and not serving the people.

178
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,480
 Moses had condemned these practices in Leviticus and Deuteronomy.

179
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:55,440
 And yet, 3000 years later, it might well be a picture of much of 21st century society.

180
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:03,460
 In Hong Kong, we have the biggest, rich, poor gap in the developed world.

181
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:11,440
 The poor, the asylum seekers, domestic helpers, and others don't seem to get a fair rub of

182
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,480
 the green.

183
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:22,240
 The living Bible tells us the matter is lost in red tape and bureaucracy.

184
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,160
 The temptation to this honest game is always there with man.

185
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,360
 It was once said that power tends to corrupt.

186
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,720
 Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

187
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:45,600
 But interestingly, chapter five reserves its biggest chunk of verses, not on robbing God,

188
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:55,880
 not on robbing others, but the instruction to do not rob yourself.

189
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,840
 And guys, we're visiting old territory here.

190
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,400
 Each week, we've talked about the futility, the Havel.

191
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,880
 Johnny covered the futility of wealth in chapter two.

192
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,880
 And some of the ideas are repeated here.

193
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:23,040
 But what the writer does here is to demolish some of the myths about wealth.

194
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:31,000
 They are ones that are so commonly held here in Hong Kong, that if, let's suggest we do

195
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,100
 a street survey on Monday morning, on the bridge going across to Exchange Square.

196
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,520
 These are the very answers we would probably get from most people.

197
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,440
 What they would tell you is this, wealth brings satisfaction.

198
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,800
 Wealth solves every problem.

199
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,440
 Wealth brings peace of mind.

200
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,560
 And wealth brings security.

201
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:05,740
 They are the very things that many Hong Kong parents are hammering into our kids as they

202
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:11,600
 push them to get better grades, for a better college, for a better job, for better pay,

203
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,400
 for a better spouse and a better life.

204
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,880
 It's the society we live in and operate in.

205
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:26,480
 But this chapter shows us they are only illusions.

206
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,200
 And those who believe them, subscribe to them are only robbing themselves.

207
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,040
 They are robbing themselves of the blessing that God has for them.

208
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,660
 And I don't want any of us to be sucked in by these illusions.

209
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:50,840
 And the first one is this, wealth brings satisfaction.

210
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,360
 Money is a God in Hong Kong.

211
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,280
 Full stop.

212
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:06,840
 People dream about it, are obsessed with getting it and believe it will satisfy them.

213
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,240
 I Googled how to make a million dollars overnight.

214
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,960
 US dollars, of course, right?

215
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,940
 I discovered 5 million websites telling me how to do it.

216
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:30,720
 What they don't tell you is this, when you get that million, you don't stop.

217
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,760
 You want another, add another.

218
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,120
 The appetite is created, but not satisfied.

219
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:47,120
 Read this, he who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth

220
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,400
 with his income.

221
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,960
 This is also vanity.

222
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,860
 The human heart is made in such a way, we are wired in such a way that it could only

223
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,140
 be satisfied by God.

224
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,460
 British Old Testament scholar Derek Kidner wrote this, if anything is worse than the

225
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:19,000
 addiction that money brings, it is the emptiness it leaves.

226
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,840
 Man with eternity in his heart needs better nourishment than this.

227
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:34,000
 Which moves us on to the second illusion, wealth solves every problem.

228
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,120
 The writer goes on to say that wealth, rather than solving all problems, brings its own

229
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,440
 set of problems.

230
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,260
 Look at this, when goods increase, they increase who eat them.

231
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:53,400
 And what advantage has the owner but to see them with his eyes?

232
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,820
 I got to tell you, the wealthy have no shortage of people who are willing to spend their money

233
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,220
 for them.

234
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,640
 Wealth is a people magnet.

235
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,280
 It attracts human parasites.

236
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:15,880
 Remember the portugal sun, when he had money, he had no shortage of Facebook friends.

237
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,400
 When the money disappeared, so did the Facebook friends.

238
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:29,480
 The truth is that wealth often creates new problems that you did not know existed before.

239
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,280
 I love what John Wesley, who founded the Methodist Church said to put in perspective.

240
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:41,960
 He said, "Make all you can, save all you can, give all you can."

241
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,240
 I remember when it was announced I was quitting my job to be senior pastor of the Vine.

242
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:53,320
 At that time, the Vine was only a small church and wasn't able to afford very much.

243
00:22:53,320 --> 00:23:00,240
 I lost count of the well-meaning people who said, "I know you love your church, but I

244
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,800
 also know you love your job.

245
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:10,920
 Why not work for another 10 years or so, save some money, and then go to work for the church?"

246
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,040
 But God showed Sandra and I a picture.

247
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,440
 I want to share it with you.

248
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,440
 We were standing on the back of a lorry, a van.

249
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,120
 The back was filled with gold.

250
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,840
 And what we were doing, we were shoveling the gold.

251
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:32,440
 We were giving away as quick as we can, but the pile of gold was not going down.

252
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,280
 And that has been our testimony these past 20 years.

253
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,920
 The third illusion is that wealth brings peace of mind.

254
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,760
 Verse 12 highlights yet another problem that wealth can bring.

255
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,800
 Sweet is the sleep of a labourer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach

256
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,240
 of the rich will not let him sleep.

257
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:03,800
 They say there is no better sleeping pill than an honest day's work.

258
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:10,480
 Wealth brings with it baggage that tends to get in the way of a good night's sleep, anxiety

259
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,320
 concerning keeping the riches, worries about being robbed, constantly thinking about how

260
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,840
 to get more riches.

261
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,480
 I could go on, but I'll tell you about J.D. Rockefeller.

262
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,920
 He was the world's first billionaire.

263
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,720
 When he became a billionaire, there wasn't another billionaire on planet Earth.

264
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,880
 At 53 years of age, he became very sick.

265
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,000
 He couldn't sleep.

266
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,640
 He'd lost weight.

267
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,400
 He had insomnia.

268
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,880
 And all he could eat was crackers and milk because of his many ulcers.

269
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,480
 His health continued to decline.

270
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,440
 His life was falling apart.

271
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,040
 For some reason around that age, he decided to start giving money away.

272
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,140
 He became a philanthropist.

273
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,960
 He built hospitals and orphanages and gave money away.

274
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,280
 He began to sleep.

275
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,000
 He gained weight and his health improved.

276
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,240
 He died at 98 years of age.

277
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,780
 My friends, money.

278
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,040
 Money can buy tangible assets.

279
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,280
 Things that you can touch are tangible assets.

280
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,700
 Money can only buy this.

281
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,540
 You can't buy intangible assets.

282
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,300
 Things that you can't touch are intangible assets.

283
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,280
 Money can't buy these assets.

284
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,280
 And peace of mind is an intangible asset.

285
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,500
 You can't touch it.

286
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,000
 You can just feel it.

287
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,040
 And I need to tell you that peace of mind comes from God.

288
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,440
 It's a gift.

289
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,480
 You can't buy peace of mind.

290
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,400
 And the last illusion is this.

291
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,520
 Wealth brings security.

292
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,400
 There is a grievous evil that I've seen under the sun.

293
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,280
 Riches were kept by the owner to his hurt.

294
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,960
 And those riches were lost in a bad venture.

295
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,600
 And he is a father of a son and he has nothing in his hand.

296
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,440
 As he came from his mother's womb, he should go again naked as he came and should take

297
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,720
 nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand.

298
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,640
 This is also a grievous evil.

299
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,600
 Just as he came, so he shall go.

300
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,120
 What gain is there to him who toils for the wind?

301
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:43,000
 Moreover, all his days he eats in darkness with much vexation and sickness and anger.

302
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,960
 I want to focus on the expression in verse 13.

303
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,120
 Riches were kept by their owner to his hurt.

304
00:26:52,120 --> 00:27:01,040
 This speaks of the person who sees his securities in the number of noughts in his bank balance.

305
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:08,160
 It paints a picture of him holding on to his wealth with a tight clenched fist.

306
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,880
 The hurt spoken about in verse 13 may have been caused by a number of things.

307
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,600
 He may make an improper use of his riches and lose his health by them.

308
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,040
 Or he may join an unfortunate business partnership and lose everything.

309
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,240
 Or his riches may excite the desire of a robber who may steal his goods or even take away

310
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,960
 his life.

311
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,500
 Or he may leave them to the next generation who turn out to be recklessly extravagant

312
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,120
 or wasteful in the use of resources, spends the whole, ruins both his body and soul.

313
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,680
 I've seen that time and time again.

314
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:59,280
 The preacher reminds us that the person who dies with the most money still dies.

315
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,600
 As he came from his mother womb, he should go again naked as he came.

316
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,720
 He shall take nothing from his toil that he may carry away in his hand.

317
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,800
 This is not a great advert for wealth.

318
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,480
 Proverbs 3.26 says, "For the Lord is your security.

319
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,080
 He will keep your foot from being caught in a trap."

320
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,040
 The New Testament gives a more hopeful picture, taking us beyond the preachers under the sun

321
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,160
 premise and telling us that we can lay up treasure.

322
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,920
 Oh yes, we can.

323
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,800
 We can lay up treasure in heaven.

324
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:47,400
 You can't take your wealth with you when you die, but you can send it on ahead by generous

325
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,880
 giving to God's work.

326
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,440
 My friends, don't rob yourself.

327
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,680
 But I wanted to finish, not with the negatives of don't do this and don't do that.

328
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:14,280
 I wanted to finish on a positive note and the writer obliges with his final three verses.

329
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:25,240
 I want to take a look at them as I encourage you to seek first his kingdom.

330
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:33,520
 This is surely the key that unlocks the Ecclesiastes door.

331
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,940
 Let's roll the clock forward a thousand years or so.

332
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,280
 In the middle of his famous sermon on the Mount, Jesus turns to his followers and in

333
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:48,680
 a complete answer to Ecclesiastes chapter five says, "Don't be anxious.

334
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,280
 Don't worry about what you eat.

335
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,120
 Don't worry about what you wear."

336
00:29:52,120 --> 00:30:02,400
 And he says this, Matthew 6.33, "But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness."

337
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:10,560
 And all these things will be added to you.

338
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:18,000
 American singer Karen Lafferty wrote the song, "Seek Ye First the Kingdom of God" in 1974.

339
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,720
 And Sandra and I remember her coming to a church in our village in the UK, a small church

340
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,440
 in the early '80s.

341
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,840
 It has become one of the most sung Christian songs of the past 50 years and has stuck with

342
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,400
 me ever since.

343
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:39,680
 We'll sing it in a few moments, but this is what the preacher said.

344
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,920
 "Behold, what I've seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment in

345
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:51,680
 all the toil which one tore under the sun the few days of his life that God has given

346
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,160
 him, for this is his lot.

347
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:59,580
 But also to whom God has given wealth and possessions and power to enjoy them and to

348
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:05,760
 accept his lot and rejoice in his toil, this is the gift of God.

349
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:13,120
 For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with

350
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,320
 joy in his heart."

351
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,860
 Though the preacher knew that riches did not bring true meaning to life.

352
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,120
 He was no fool.

353
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,320
 He understood it was better to have wealth than not to have it.

354
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:39,280
 And under the sun, one should enjoy both wealth and the capacity to enjoy it as a gift of

355
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,600
 God.

356
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:51,920
 The important thing for us is that we love the Lord, accept the lot he bestows us, he

357
00:31:51,920 --> 00:32:00,040
 assigns us, and enjoy the blessings that he graciously bestowed.

358
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,520
 I started off by saying the title "Stop Fief."

359
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,120
 There's two ways you can look at this.

360
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:12,920
 Either the fest happened, you say, "Stop Fief," and the police come, or before it happens

361
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:21,080
 we say, "Stop Fief."

362
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:28,440
 If I wanted to stop a theft in your home, I'd probably install a burger alarm.

363
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,720
 If I wanted to stop a theft in your car, I'd probably install the camera we mentioned earlier.

364
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:42,480
 But in that vein, I want to stop theft in your life.

365
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:51,840
 So I'm going to install a safe, and to do that I'm going to use the letters SAFE.

366
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:59,120
 Let me summarise as I conclude my message, how to stay safe.

367
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,880
 S, serve your Lord.

368
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,320
 Invest in his kingdom's work.

369
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,360
 Be content with Jesus.

370
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,360
 He's enough.

371
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
 We sing it, don't we?

372
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,080
 Christ is enough for me.

373
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,360
 A, accept your lot.

374
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,640
 Accept your station.

375
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,760
 The grass is not always greener on the other side.

376
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,120
 Be content with what you've been given.

377
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,960
 F, fulfil your labour.

378
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,700
 Work, be steady.

379
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:38,160
 Do a good day's work, and it's a good witness to your boss and your co-workers.

380
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,480
 And you can invite them on Alpha as well.

381
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,800
 And E, enjoy your life.

382
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,600
 Don't get caught up in the greed trap.

383
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,680
 Laugh more.

384
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,760
 Lighten up.

385
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,560
 Relax.

386
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,800
 Ecclesiastes 5 tells us this.

387
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:11,080
 If we focus more on the gifts than the giver, we are guilty of idolatry.

388
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:19,480
 If we accept his gifts, but complain about them, we are guilty of ingratitude.

389
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:28,360
 If we hoard his gifts and won't share them, we are guilty of indulgence.

390
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:38,960
 But if we yield to his will and use what he gives us for his glory, then we can enjoy

391
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,560
 life and be satisfied.

392
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:53,720
 My friends, seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things

393
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,880
 will be added unto you.

394
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,880
 Hallelujah.

395
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
 Amen.
