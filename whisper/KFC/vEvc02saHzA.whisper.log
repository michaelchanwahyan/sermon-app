[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   I love the response here.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.120]   Now just before we start, let's play a little game.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.720]   Okay, I just added it right now.
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.720]   This is a photo of me and my family.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.240]   Can anybody guess which country this is in?
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.120]   Just by this photo, you can tell if you have been here.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.480]   I'm going to try to point out the specialty.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.760]   No, it's not China.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.720]   So look at this stack of things.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.720]   Oh, somebody said Canada.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.720]   All right.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.120]   Please get a gift, a cookie from Bonnie at the end of this.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.120]   Thank you.
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.920]   Now, if you've been to Canada, you know that there is a restaurant that has these huge
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.240]   lobsters and they're so big that they're like 20 pounds each.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.280]   Okay, they're like gigantic.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.040]   So if you've ever been there, you would recognize it by.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.380]   All right, good job.
[00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.880]   So some of you might or may not know me.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.360]   My name is Michelle, and I serve as one of the pastors here.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.440]   It's really my honor here today to share a message with you.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.460]   And it's on my heart really to share about honoring our father and mother.
[00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.520]   This is a topic that is huge in my heart, and I would love to share with you.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.760]   Now, many a times we would think about why is it that we need to honor our father and
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.760]   mother?
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.760]   Sometimes we think why?
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.840]   And at the same time, we're thinking, what does it mean to honor?
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.280]   I mean, yes, we kind of know what that word is.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.920]   But at the same time, we don't really.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.400]   What's the difference between honoring them?
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.800]   And then is it the same as obeying everything they say?
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.160]   But what does it mean in the Bible when they ask us to honor our mother and father?
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.400]   And at the same time, how do we do it in our everyday life?
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.880]   So then we're following God's heart.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.800]   So today we're going to package all of that together.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.520]   And let us start by reading this verse together.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.680]   Can you all see this?
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.400]   All right, let's read it together.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.720]   One, two, three.
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.600]   Honor your father and your mother that your days may be long in the land that the Lord
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.160]   your God is giving you.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.840]   Now this is from Exodus.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.960]   It's part of the Ten Commandments.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.520]   Now I don't know, but if you were to think, okay, how did God give the Ten Commandments?
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.880]   I mean, did he give it through an email or maybe a WhatsApp?
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.180]   So then we can just kind of sit on our couch and we can scroll.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.560]   You know how it is when you add a new app, right?
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.840]   You have all these agreements and what you do, you just scroll to the bottom and you
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.200]   say, I agree, right?
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.280]   But no, God didn't do that.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.200]   And neither did God give it to Moses so that he could tell everybody about the Ten Commandments.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.560]   But you know what?
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   God actually spoke to the entire nation in person so that they would know the Ten Commandments.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.740]   And this is how important it is to our God.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.480]   Now how did he do it?
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.040]   He actually had them consecrated themselves for the last three days before receiving that
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.040]   message.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   What does it mean?
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.800]   So they need to wash their clothes.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.080]   They need to refrain from any sexual relationships.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.400]   And then they have to wait for the Lord.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.140]   And how did it happen?
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.600]   Three days later, when they were ready to receive the word, God began to show up.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.520]   The very first thing that happened was there was thunder and there was lightning.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.480]   So it was just like a few weeks ago.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.920]   You remember there was thunder so strong that when it roared, your heart feel like the drum
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.920]   set was inside your heart.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.600]   Is that huge?
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.800]   And what he did was he came as a thick cloud onto the mountain in Mount Sinai.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.160]   And the whole mountain was burning in fire.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.960]   And the entire mountain was shaking.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.160]   It was trembling because what?
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.720]   God himself, God of the universe showed up.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.200]   And this is how important the Ten Commandments is.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.800]   And many times we think to ourselves, "But it's only for the Israelites.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800]   It's for those people."
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.840]   But no, it's for everyone who believes in God.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.560]   Because in the New Testament, Jesus said that I came not to abolish the laws, but what?
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.680]   To fulfill them.
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.140]   And as followers of Christ, we would do that too.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:52.280]   And so not only is it that the Ten Commandments was really important, but at the same time,
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.040]   you know, there are only 10 things you can put on there, right?
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:05.320]   And guess when, out of these 10, where does honoring your father and mother stand?
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.120]   Anybody can shout out, maybe you can get a cookie too.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.720]   Five, that's right.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.720]   Look at that.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.720]   It's fifth.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.120]   Now, how often it is when we think about, have we sinned against God?
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.180]   Usually, I mean, I'm guilty of this.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.440]   What I do is I start thinking, "All right, have I been worshiping other gods?
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   Let me see.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.800]   Have I been making an idol so I would worship?
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.360]   Did I murder anyone?
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.640]   Nope, I guess no, maybe not the past year.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.840]   I mean, let's not go back all the way.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.880]   And we think about, have we stole anybody's stuff?
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.880]   Nope, nope.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.240]   So we're checking each one off.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:48.440]   But how often really is it that we think about, have we sinned against God by not honoring
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   our father and mother?
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.400]   I mean, I don't know about you, but I certainly haven't.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.080]   I should start.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.120]   And basically, what does that mean?
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.760]   That means that we have just, we like to pick and choose what are the important ones, but
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.760]   God has shown us what's important.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.640]   And being in fifth place also has a very special thing that we can note.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.640]   What is it?
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.640]   Is that the first four were actually about God himself.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:26.680]   And this is the very first commandment that God gave about how we treat other people.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.200]   And so he finds it to be the most important thing for us if we want it to treat other
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.200]   people.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.040]   And that's why he put it in the fifth commandment.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:42.280]   And so I just wanted to say that the first reason that we would need to honor our parents,
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.640]   because it's extremely, really very, very important to God.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:53.400]   And if it's so important to God, we should really take it into our heart.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:02.080]   And now as we continue to look at this 10 commandments, we realize that it's so important
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:07.400]   that God himself had to tell us and he didn't give it to someone else.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   Right?
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:16.000]   But at the same time, what we also see is that God has established this authority to
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.200]   us in our families.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   Now think about this.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.020]   God has established different authorities, right?
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.960]   He has had before judges and kings, priests, prophets, and they were the ones that would
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.380]   be in charge.
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.520]   They would be the one in authority.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.920]   And yet God put parents, father and mother as our authority.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:47.480]   Now when we honor them, we're not only honoring the parent, we're actually honoring the person
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.960]   who has established this authority.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.960]   And who is that?
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.800]   That's our God.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.080]   And so when we honor our parents, we are honoring God himself.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.720]   It's a way for us to honor God.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:06.800]   Now at the same time, we can see that the third thing is that when we honor our father
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   and mother, it is actually our act of worship.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.800]   Now why would that be?
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:17.440]   I mean, we've already established the second point where it's honoring God, but remember,
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.840]   that's only the fifth commandment, honoring your father and mother, that's just the first
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.000]   part.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.860]   What is the promise?
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.460]   That your days will be long in the land that the Lord, your God has given you.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.580]   So there is a promise to it.
[00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:39.400]   And so when we honor our father and mother, we are actually putting our faith into the
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.900]   promise that God has given to us.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:46.020]   Now this is not like using our father and mother so that we get goodies.
[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.020]   It's not like that.
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.540]   I mean, technically we do get blessings from God, but what that really means is that you're
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.100]   telling God, God, I trust your word.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:00.500]   I trust it so much that I'm going to do something in order to receive the blessing that you
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.700]   have promised.
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:07.080]   And that to God is an extremely honoring thing for him.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:16.300]   So for us to honor our parents is a way that we tell God, we believe that the promise you
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:22.100]   have for us, the land, the long life, you're going to give that to us.
[00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:28.660]   Now every so often we might find someone who has honored their parents, but have not received
[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.660]   that.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.100]   And that's because there are other factors affecting it.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:37.700]   That's just the same as when we go exercise, we believe that it's going to let us slim
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.060]   down and we're going to have a healthy body.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.340]   But sometimes that doesn't happen because there are other factors affecting it, but
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.300]   it does not invalidate that promise.
[00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.540]   So that's why we can continue to believe in God and to know that we can hold onto his
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.360]   promise.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:02.020]   So now that we have established these three points as the reasons why we need to and why
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:09.820]   we should, and we definitely have to, if we're Christians to honor God, is to honor our parents.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.140]   Now really what does the word honor means?
[00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.180]   I mean, we have heard that word before.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.380]   Now is there any English teacher in the room?
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.180]   Well, even if you are, I guess you don't want to put up your hand at this moment.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:29.480]   Let's look into the word honor and let's see what the English dictionary says.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:37.620]   So here it says that honor means to have great respect for someone or an award given to someone
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.980]   for something that they have done.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.420]   We're like, oh, that's great.
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.060]   What's respect again?
[00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.860]   So now we look at what respect is in the English dictionary as well.
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:53.260]   So this is a strong feeling of approval of someone or something because of their good
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.820]   qualities and achievements.
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.980]   Now we put that two together.
[00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.980]   Do you see some similarities among the words?
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.340]   I mean, they should, I mean, they are going in the same direction.
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:12.220]   And what we see, which is very interesting, is that both of these words have a sense of
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.940]   an approval or award.
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.100]   So you're giving something.
[00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.300]   It's like a praise, which is good.
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:24.700]   But for what reason they said something that they have done or the good qualities or achievement
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.980]   that they have done.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.380]   Now this is how the English dictionary tells us.
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.980]   Now just keep that in mind for now.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.220]   And we're going to go to the original text.
[00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.420]   We're going to go to Hebrew to see what is it.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:41.700]   The Hebrew language is the language that the 10 commandments was recorded in.
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:46.340]   So we're going to have a look and see how they understood this word.
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.060]   Now honor, kabad, really is to have weight.
[00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.020]   Now weight means importance.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.420]   To have weight and respect.
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.380]   Respect in Hebrew means to revere or to fear.
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.540]   A high praise to another person because of what?
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.380]   That person's status.
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.780]   That person's status.
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:13.180]   Now also in the New Testament, Jesus also referred to the fifth commandment and he used
[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:17.700]   the word honor in Greek, which is timal.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.980]   And what's the definition?
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:28.940]   It is to assign value, to give proper recognition because of office, position or wealth.
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:34.100]   Now again, when we put those together, what is it that you see?
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:39.200]   You see in the Hebrew word, it really means to give value, to give importance.
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.340]   But what's the reason?
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.180]   It isn't for something that they have done.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:49.700]   And it's not for something that they're, it's not about their character either, but it's
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.020]   for a status.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.700]   It's for a position that they hold.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.260]   And what kind of a position does our parents hold?
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.860]   Well, they're a father and they're a mother.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.540]   They don't have to earn it to be our father and mother.
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.380]   And neither do they have to be perfect to be your father and mother.
[00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:09.940]   And I mean, we're not definitely not perfect.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.260]   But in the English word, it has that sense where you get to be the person who judges
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.660]   and say, rather or not, you approve or not.
[00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.700]   But in the Hebrew and the Greek, you don't.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:27.700]   And we aren't in the position and we shouldn't be to judge rather or not they are and whether
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.740]   or not we should honor them, right?
[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:37.620]   So here from the Hebrew and from the Greek, we see what God really meant when he said,
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.900]   honor your father and mother.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:46.340]   It means to give them importance because of their position.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:50.580]   And so as we continue, we're going to see, all right, so now we get it.
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.180]   I get why we need to do it.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.180]   I also now get the word, but really, how do we do it?
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.580]   And what does it look like in our everyday life?
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:03.980]   Because I don't really get what does it mean to give importance to someone?
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:10.500]   Now, so we'll first look at, I won't be reading this, but I'll be telling you what it is.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.740]   This is a story of Ruth.
[00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:18.900]   Now Ruth is, Ruth and Naomi, some of you may have read it before.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:24.380]   So Naomi is someone who had two sons and a husband.
[00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:33.640]   But sad tragedies happened and both her husband and the two sons have passed away.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.940]   And now she has two daughters-in-law and she knew that she couldn't give any more sons
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.700]   to the two daughters-in-law.
[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.220]   So she has asked them, why don't you guys go back to Moab where you came from?
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:50.940]   You might be able to find a husband there and give birth and have your own offspring.
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.500]   So one of them went off, but Ruth, the other one, would not.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:01.080]   And she insisted, and this is what she said too, "Do not urge me to leave you or return.
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.040]   For where you go, I will go.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.760]   Where you lodge, I will lodge.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.120]   And your people shall be my people.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.960]   Where you die, I will die.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.960]   There will I be buried.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:18.000]   May the Lord do to me and more also, if anything, but death parts me from you."
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.880]   Now she has this determination, but do you know what she's determined?
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:31.240]   She is determined to consider her mother-in-law first before herself.
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   I'll say it again.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:38.160]   She's determined to consider her mother-in-law first before herself.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.160]   What does that mean?
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:46.560]   Actually, we can learn from the story that in order to put an importance to someone,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:52.000]   it's really deciding that they have priority even above yours.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.320]   Think about this.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.680]   Back then, this is for Ruth.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:02.280]   If she had no husband, if she had no sons, she would be nothing in that society.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:08.040]   And so she said that, "I'm willing because I know if I'm not going with you, you as a
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.680]   widow, an old lady, would have nothing.
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:17.880]   And the only thing that I could do is that I would consider your benefits before mine."
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:24.560]   And what she did was she put her life, she put her offspring, she put her future and
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:33.160]   everything into that basket and said, "I would rather consider you first before me."
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.760]   And this is what honoring means, to put them before you.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.400]   Now I want to put it in the 2020 context for you.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:49.920]   I mean, what if you see a new iPhone that comes out and you're like, "Oh, it's got a
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.440]   three camera on the back.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.440]   Oh, wait.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   Yes, on the back."
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.000]   You're like, "It's so good."
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And what do you want?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   You want to get it, right?
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.600]   So you go and you purchase it.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.760]   And what do you do?
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.400]   You give your old phone to your mom.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.460]   We've all done that.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.460]   Don't be guilty.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.920]   And then your mom is actually very happy because why?
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.880]   She's saying that, "Oh yeah, don't give me the new one because I would waste it.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.520]   I don't know all the functions and what does this button do again?
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.360]   How come it only has one button?"
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:28.920]   And so it seems "wasteful" on her, wouldn't it?
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:39.680]   In the same way, it was "wasteful" for Ruth to put her life aside for her mother-in-law.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.400]   But imagine what if we saw, "Oh, there's a new iPhone that's coming out.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   Oh, it's so good.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.320]   Can I get one for my mom?"
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.760]   No, but think about that.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.560]   Honoring them, putting them before you.
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.600]   And what if you go shopping and as men, you see, "Oh, this is a really nice shirt."
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   I don't know how men think.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.000]   Sorry, I'm just thinking about how men think.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.040]   "This is a really nice shirt.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.960]   Wow, the style is very nice."
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:11.320]   And you go to the salesperson and you ask, "My dad wears an extra large.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.080]   Do you have a size in that?"
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:19.200]   Putting them first in our everyday life.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:25.040]   And at the same time, we continue to look at another record in the Bible, which is in
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.400]   Ephesians chapter 6, verse 1 to 3.
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.720]   Here Paul actually exhortates and he says, "Children, obey your parents in the Lord,
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.280]   for this is right."
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.880]   And he then quotes, "Honor your father and mother.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:44.000]   This is the first commandment with a promise that it may go well with you and that you
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.840]   may live long in the land."
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   Remember this, right?
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.480]   This is from the fifth commandment.
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.480]   Now notice here, he does ask us to obey our parents, doesn't he?
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.720]   Notice something that he tags on at the back.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.560]   He says, "Obey your parents in the Lord."
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.560]   Now in the Lord is a very interesting phrase.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.560]   What does that mean?
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.720]   So it has two meanings.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:11.480]   The first meaning is that it means that you do unto them as if you're doing it to God.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:17.800]   And the other meaning is that you do to them, you obey them in the principle and the teachings
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.240]   and in the characteristics of the Lord.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.480]   Now again, what does that look like, right?
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:30.640]   Basically that means in our everyday life, I mean, it's easy if our parents just ask
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.360]   us to go get the groceries, I don't think we really need this, okay?
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.360]   Is it in the Lord?
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   I don't know.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.040]   Just get the grocery, okay?
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.360]   Now, so it's not really for those scenarios, but it is for other ones, okay?
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.560]   It is for the gray areas.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.640]   Okay, what if your mom tells you or your dad tells you, "Go get a job, okay?
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.040]   Go get a job, son."
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.700]   And then what is it that you go through in your mind?
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.800]   If we obey, yes, I'm going to go get a job, but in the Lord, it means that I'm going to
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.840]   do it in a way that glorifies God.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.080]   And how does that look like?
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.280]   Well, it means I'm going to start evaluating.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.960]   Does this job allow me to spread gospel to my friends, the coworkers?
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:18.280]   Does it even allow me to have an alpha class there so that I can tell people about Jesus?
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:25.160]   And or is this job going to have temptations there where it drags me away from following
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   God?
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.360]   And if it does, then I'll stay away from that.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:32.080]   So what it really means is that obey them, yes, in the Lord.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.480]   Well, if it's neutral, you do it in God's principle.
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:40.320]   Now, of course, we get to the hard part where it is that you actually have a conflicting
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:47.640]   situation where your mom and dad ask you to do something that is different than the Lord's
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.760]   teaching.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:53.480]   They might ask you to a date a certain person that has a very different belief than you
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:59.240]   do and you believe that it might drag you away from worshiping God.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.880]   And so what do you do?
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.840]   Well, in that case, obey, but in the Lord.
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.080]   Now, the Lord, if you're doing it to him, he would not ask you to do that.
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.000]   So in the Lord has its boundaries.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.040]   So you would simply have to say, "No, I cannot because of my faith."
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.680]   Now just because of that, remember we said it's also in the qualities of Christ, the
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.100]   characteristics of Christ.
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.100]   So what does that mean?
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.480]   That means even when you say no, don't just stop there.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.840]   Continue to do all the 99 things that were not against the Lord.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.920]   And your parents will be very, very strange.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.720]   I mean, your parents will find you to be very strange.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   They're not going to be strange.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.640]   They'll find you to be strange.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.640]   And why?
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.800]   Because they're like, "Wait a minute.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.740]   I thought we just had this fight.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.720]   Why are you still going to do all these things?"
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.720]   And you know what?
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:56.400]   That's when we become the good testimony for God.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:01.880]   And for the parents that we didn't have, they're not believing yet.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:09.020]   That's when they wonder, "Why is it that my son or my daughter is willing to still obey
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:14.680]   everything else I say, except the ones that are against their faith?"
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.760]   And so that allows us to have an opportunity to share our faith with them.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.240]   We should use that.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.840]   Oh, I stayed on this slide.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:29.880]   So the second thing that is easy for us to grasp what honoring means is to obey them
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   in the Lord.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:38.360]   Now, the third thing that we want to look at together is a record from Matthew, chapter
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.360]   15.
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:45.160]   So here is an interesting record, because Jesus, who was asked by the Pharisees, the
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:52.600]   tribes, and also the religious leaders, "Why is it that your disciples don't follow the
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:58.400]   traditions, the teachings of our laws?"
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:03.960]   And the Lord really replied him, surprisingly, using the fifth commandment.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:11.680]   And he says this, "For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother, and whoever reviles
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.240]   father or mother must surely die.'
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.920]   But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother what you would have gained from
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:26.080]   me is given to God, he need not honor his father.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:31.280]   So for the sake of your tradition, you have made void the word of God, you hypocrites.'"
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.840]   Now let me just kind of dissect that a little bit.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.840]   What did I just read?
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:42.680]   What that really meant was that there were people in the religious authorities who told
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:48.040]   the believers that, "You know, whatever you've put aside to honor your father, to take care
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:53.080]   of them, you were going to buy something or you were going to pay for this for them, don't
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.320]   worry about it.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:01.400]   Use that money, give it to God, and you would have done your duty of honoring."
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.760]   And that, Jesus says, is a hypocrite.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.480]   Now why would that, what does that have to do with us?
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.040]   Because we need to care for our parents.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:16.640]   But if we think that, "Well, people tell me that as a Christian, what I need to do is
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.800]   I need to go to church, join a small group, I'll read the Bible, I'll pray, and I'll tithe,
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:28.960]   which means I'll give part of my money to God, and I think I've done all those things."
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:39.080]   And yet, if we go home and we don't honor our parents, Jesus calls us hypocrites, calls
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:45.440]   us hypocrites, because we can't say that we've already done everything for God, but then
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:51.600]   not really understanding His commands and what's on His heart.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.760]   And so for us really, is to take care of our parents.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:55.760]   Remember that sum of money?
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.040]   Well, that sum of money wasn't just going to sit there, the sum of money were meant
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.880]   to take care of them, to provide for them, to give to them.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:14.040]   And so here today, we actually have three different ways for us to honor our father
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:20.840]   and mother in a very contextual way, which is to consider them before ourselves, which
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:26.480]   is to obey them in the Lord, and also to care for them, especially when they're in old age.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:31.680]   Now right now, I want to share a little bit of my story with you, because I think it ties
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.960]   in a lot with this topic today.
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:38.800]   Now I have a lot of memories with me and my mom, so I'm going to share a little bit with
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.120]   you.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.240]   So one of which is, I remember a number of years ago when I was working in an iBank,
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.640]   and I would have these clients meeting all the time, and I would be with my boss, and
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.240]   so we'll all be in this room.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.960]   Of course, your parents pick the best time to call you, right?
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.720]   So you see your phone ringing and ringing, and you're like, "Oh, wow, I really can't
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.720]   take this."
[00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.840]   So you just kind of mute it, or you swipe it.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.560]   And so they call for a few times, right?
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.120]   You're just going to put it aside.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:16.160]   And after a while, I really thought to myself, "You know, I think my mom, she's really important
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.560]   to me.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.800]   She's way more important to me than my boss."
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   Hello, boss.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:28.920]   And then my job, then the clients that I need to see, then the people.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.760]   Because I can lose all those things, and I would literally be okay, but it would not
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:36.120]   be okay if I lost my mother.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.840]   So from that moment on, I was telling myself, "All right, let's switch around."
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.400]   So now when the phone calls, I actually excuse myself, or I just pick it up, and I see what
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:46.880]   it is that's on her mind.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.760]   Or if I really can't, I immediately WhatsApp her and say, "Oh, I really am in a meeting.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.840]   What can I do for you?"
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:59.720]   And I think those little things, it's just a way because I wanted to honor her.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.520]   I really want her to not have to struggle.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.520]   Maybe sometimes she's at the fish market, and all her question is, "Do you want fish
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.520]   tonight?"
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.520]   And that was it.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.440]   But I don't want her to be hanging for a few hours.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:19.320]   And to really make her important in my life and every day kind of looks like this.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.440]   And every day when I go home, I would go into her...
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:27.000]   Well, if she's already in her room, I'll go into her room, or we'll just be at the dinner
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.720]   table, and I would share with her the whole day, what happened.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   And you know what?
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.440]   I just want to let you know, she probably knows more about you guys than you guys know,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.240]   because I've told her everything about everybody.
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.280]   But because I think, what is it that she wants?
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.680]   What is it that our parents want?
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.560]   Isn't it to connect with their children?
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.080]   Isn't it to be a part of their lives?
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.280]   But then maybe sometimes you just go home, shut our door, and if they ask, "Oh, how was
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   your day?"
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.920]   Or, "How did that date go?"
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.040]   You're kind of, "Don't ask me."
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:09.200]   But maybe if we prioritize them, and if we engage them in our lives, then it will open
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   a door for us to connect together.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.760]   And the third one is a little bit hard to say, because...
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.040]   So one time, I find my mom to be annoying.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.600]   Oops, hi, Mommy.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.720]   And what happened was...
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:33.200]   So I went home, and I was like, "Oh, well, thank God I can actually get off on time that
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.200]   one day."
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.600]   And so I was sitting on my couch, just turning on the TV, that time in me time, okay?
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.040]   Nobody bugs me now.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:47.840]   And so this small, still voice, which is not God, comes out from the end of the hall, okay?
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.840]   And it's like, "Hey."
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.840]   Oh, hey.
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.600]   And then she tells me, "Oh, I have this bump, this bump."
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.720]   And I'm like, "Okay, I know you have had it for like two months."
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.520]   I thought to myself, "And I asked you to go to the doctor, which you didn't."
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.640]   And so she's like, "It's seeping blood."
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.040]   I'm like, "Okay, but I'm watching TV."
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.400]   And so she goes around the house trying to find a band-aid, and of course, they never
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.720]   find it.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.840]   And the band-aid don't know where they went at that time.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.680]   All the other times, the band-aid just kind of lies on the table.
[00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.240]   But just the moment when you need it, you can't find it.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.520]   So in my head, I was thinking, "Mom, honestly," in my head, I was like, "I just wanna sit
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.240]   there, do nothing.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.920]   Can you take care of yourself?"
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.640]   I thought for a moment, "There's really nothing much I can do."
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:45.600]   But then another thought came to mind, and I was like, "I guess she is in a lot of pain.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.320]   It has been there for two months.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.560]   It must have bothered her.
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:58.640]   And of all the people, she wanted me to care for her at that time, that particular time."
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.280]   So what did I do?
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.760]   I got up, turned off the TV, went to her room to make sure I know exactly, is it a two by
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.980]   two or is this four by two?
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:12.760]   Make sure I buy the band-aid that would be big enough to cover the bump.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.960]   So I went down to Man Lane, which is just about to close.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:23.400]   I got the band-aid, went back, cut it up, stuck it on her skin.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.240]   Did she get better?
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.240]   What do you think?
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:31.880]   No, of course not, I'm not a doctor.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:37.320]   But in her heart, she felt important.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:45.120]   She felt that she was important in my heart, and she felt that I cared for her above my
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.280]   own needs first.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:55.560]   And that moment, I think she really cherished the time where I cared for her.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.880]   And I think that was priceless.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:03.520]   And so why am I sharing these things with you is because I feel like many a times we
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:08.280]   think about what it means to honor God, and we think that it's the big stuff.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.480]   It's the big decisions, but really it's not.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:14.280]   It's the small ones.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.520]   It's the everyday life little stuff.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:24.080]   And yet those little stuff tells us, "Is she important?"
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:28.360]   Are you willing to consider them first, or yourself first?
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.240]   It's a way to honor them, right?
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.840]   Are you willing to take care of them?
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.480]   Are you willing to obey even though you really don't want to?
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.160]   I mean, most of this stuff isn't against the Lord.
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.440]   There's like one in like a hundred.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:50.520]   And yet, are we willing to go that extra mile because they're important to us?
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:59.360]   And also because God said that it is important to Him that we honor our father and mother.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:05.400]   And by doing these little things, we are already pleasing the God that we believe in.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.440]   And we don't want to be hypocrites.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.920]   We don't.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:14.160]   Jesus said, "If we'd done everything else, but we just go home and pretend that we've
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:20.920]   already done what God has asked, then we would have missed the mark."
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.960]   So I wanted to show you a photo of my mom because she probably has her back.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.800]   Can't press.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.040]   Can someone help me at the back?
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.040]   I want to press the one with my mom's photo.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:37.280]   Oh, there we go.
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.560]   This is from Mother's Day.
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.160]   Now you can see what she looks like because she knows so much about you guys.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.320]   It's only fair that you know a little bit about her.
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:52.360]   And yeah, and you might have thought, "Oh, I've never even spoken of my dad, my father,
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.400]   because tomorrow is technically...
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.160]   Not technically, it is.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.640]   It is Father's Day."
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:04.320]   Well, that's because my father passed away for more than 20 years ago.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:13.880]   And for me to honor him, even though he's not here, is I don't really do do things,
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   but he's in my heart.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.560]   He's important in my heart.
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.680]   But tomorrow we are going to do something.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:25.720]   I'm going to go to the flower market and like always on those special days, I'm going to
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:33.880]   pick out the best looking flower and I'm going to not buy the $20, you know, the small plants.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.480]   I'm going to buy them a big bouquet.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.640]   Not because I don't suppose, I don't know if he sees it.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:46.240]   This is another theological question that we'll have to talk about another time.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.920]   But because I wanted to honor him.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:51.320]   He is still important in my heart.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.680]   And when someone is, it doesn't matter where they are or what they've done or how long
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.640]   it has been.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.040]   You still treasure it and you still want to honor them.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.360]   So tomorrow, oh, it's showing, okay, so this is my dad and me.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.160]   It's pretty cute back then, eh?
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.400]   Forcing you guys all to agree with me.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:17.920]   But I just wanted to say that honoring our father and mother is so important in God's
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.920]   heart.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:24.080]   And earlier today, actually while we were praying, I was crying.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.880]   I was crying not because I have to preach and I'm not sure how I'm going to do.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:37.640]   I was crying because I just think, God, you wanted it so badly for us to honor our father
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.920]   and mother.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.320]   And I'm so afraid that I don't do the just of it.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:48.160]   I'm afraid that I'm not doing a good job, that you're not understanding how much God
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.720]   wants it.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:59.000]   And so I just pray that it's in our heart that what God wants is actually the blessings
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.120]   that he wants to give to us.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:09.680]   When we honor our father and mother, that promise doesn't say, "Then God is happy."
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.360]   It doesn't even say, "Then your parents are happy."
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:19.000]   It says that so that you would live long in the land that the Lord, your God has given
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.320]   you.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.880]   It's a way for God to want to bless us.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.280]   It's not a constraint.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.280]   It is a blessing.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:36.600]   So today I hope that God has spoken to you each individually what that honoring means.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:42.000]   Maybe it means going out with them to dim sum for some of you.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.520]   Maybe it means that you'll go with them to the doctor's appointment.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.400]   Maybe it means that you'll be like me where you're now going to reply every single call
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:56.400]   that she has at the most inappropriate time.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.400]   Whatever that may look like, maybe it's buying the band-aid at a very odd hour.
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.160]   I don't know what that looks like for you, but you know what?
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:08.600]   Only you could care for your parents the way that they wanted to.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:13.160]   I can't care for your parents and neither can you care for mine, but God has placed
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.760]   them in our lives so that we could do that.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.000]   And that's such an honor for us.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:31.240]   So while we close now, let us pray together really for God to continue to speak to us.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:38.560]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you so much that you've given us parents, father and mother,
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:47.120]   people that had brought us into this life and they were the first relationships that
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:54.680]   we've ever had, the first encounter of what you and your love look like.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:37:02.520]   And Father, today I'm sure that you're speaking to all of us in a very special way.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:10.760]   How can we honor our parents starting this Father's Day and for many days to come?
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:18.800]   And Father, we just pray that we will follow your commandments because it is important
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.600]   to you.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:26.040]   And if it's important to you, Father, then it's important to us.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:34.800]   And we pray that we will follow your ways, not only to honor them, but as a way to honor
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:40.240]   you because you're worthy of our praises and honor.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.840]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:52.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
