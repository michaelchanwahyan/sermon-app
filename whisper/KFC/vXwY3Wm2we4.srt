1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Good evening.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Good evening.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 So, yeah, we've been looking at the heart of Jesus recently,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 a series looking at the heart of Jesus,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 taking a tour through the Gospels to see what Jesus did

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 and how he lived while here on earth.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 And we see his heart from the historical accounts

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 of how he healed people and how he preached

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 about the kingdom of heaven.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Now, the topic of today is how Jesus comforts.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Jesus has a heart that comforts.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 In the Gospel according to Mark, chapter 9,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Mark records an instance where Jesus comforts

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 a dad who was in distress.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Let's read from Mark, chapter 9, verse 14 again.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 "And when they," that's Jesus along with three of his disciples,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Peter, James, and John, "when they came to the disciples,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 they saw a great crowd around them and scribes arguing with them.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him."

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 So the scene is that Jesus comes down from a mountain

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 and he's swarmed by a crowd.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And overall, it's a lot of chaos.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Jesus' disciples and scribes in the crowd, everyone's arguing.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 They see Jesus, everyone runs up to him.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 And so in verse 16, Jesus asks, "Hey, what's going on?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 What are you arguing with them about?"

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 And then it's revealed,

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 "Someone from the crowd answered him, 'Teacher, I brought my son to you,

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 for he has a spirit that makes him mute.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down,

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able."

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Okay, so now we see what's going on.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 There's a boy who's possessed by a spirit or alternatively a demon.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And so naturally, his dad's in distress.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 He cares for his son, and presumably after hearing about stories

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 of Jesus healing others, he brings his son to Jesus

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 and to his followers, hoping that Jesus may be able to heal him

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 and end his misery.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 And so the father comes to Jesus, falls on his knees,

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 and begs Jesus to heal his son.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Now again, we're looking at the heart of Jesus today,

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 a heart that comforts.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And here we see a desperate father on his knees, begging Jesus to heal.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Surely now, surely now, Jesus is going to comfort this father.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Now let's see his comforting heart in verse 19.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 "And Jesus answered them, 'O faithless generation,

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 how long am I to be with you?

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 How long am I to bear with you?'"

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 What's going on?

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 How is that comforting?

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 "O faithless generation."

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 How's that comforting?

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Imagine you're at the ICU at Hong Kong's Children's Hospital.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 A doctor walks into the waiting area.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 A dad runs up to him, grabs his hand, falls on his knees,

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 pleads with him, "Help me, doctor.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 My son, he fell from the chair.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 I gave him CPR, but he's not breathing.

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Help me."

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And then the doctor, with all the care and concern that he can muster up,

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 replies, "How long will I have to deal with you?"

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 That's the sort of picture that we're seeing in Mark 9 at this point.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Okay, so there you have it, folks.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Let's comfort as Jesus comforts.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Let's all give this a try this coming week.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Let's comfort others in this way.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 That's the moral of the story, right?

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 So suppose your friend is going through a tough breakup.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 He knocks on your door.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 He's got half a tub of ice cream in one hand.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 He's got a spoon in the other and a lot of tissues.

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And he's sobbing, and between spoonfuls--

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 If that's happening to you this week, this is what you can do.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Put your hand on his shoulder and say these magic words.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 "Oh, faithless generation."

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 (Laughter)

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Okay?

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Or here's a fun one.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Next time you're at a funeral-- maybe a closed casket one, by the way--

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 picture this.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Everyone's crying.

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 You walk up to the front, and you place your flower on the casket.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Off to your left, there's a grieving widow.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 You take her hand, look her in the eye, and say,

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 "Miss Taylor, I'm so, so sorry

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 that I have to deal with this faithless generation."

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 (Laughter)

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Is that what we're meant to do?

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Copy and paste what Jesus did in this situation?

92
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I don't quite think so.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 And don't get me wrong.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Jesus is being caring and comforting here.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 He does have a heart that comforts.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 He's not out to be a jerk.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 And in order to see that today,

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 let's first look at the problems that Jesus addresses in this story.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 What are the problems here that require comfort in the first place?

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 I see two problems.

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 First, the obvious problem is that this boy is--

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 he's literally demon-possessed.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 He's possessed by a demon, and that's a pretty big problem.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 There's a spirit that prevents the boy from speaking.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 First, he's mute.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 But not only that, the spirit seizes him.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 The spirit takes the boy and slams him into the ground.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Matthew's account of the same incident in chapter 17 says

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 the demon even throws the boy sometimes into fire and water.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 It's trying to harm this kid.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 It makes him foam at the mouth like a rabid animal.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 It makes him grind his teeth.

113
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Or it makes him rigid like a board, unable to move.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 He's either tossed around violently or he's paralyzed, unable to move.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 And no wonder the dad is in distress.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 To all the parents in the room, I don't know what that would feel like.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I don't have kids, but imagine if that was your child.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 His son is possessed by a demon.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 He's suffering.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 He's afflicted.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 And that's problem number one.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 There's also a second problem in this narrative.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 The problem is this.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 The people around Jesus lack faith.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 They all lack faith--the father, the disciples, the scribes,

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 the rest of the crowd.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 They don't fully know Jesus.

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 They don't completely trust in him.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 And that's the second problem.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 And if we look at why there's chaos in the crowd so far,

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 it's firstly because the boy is demon-possessed.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 But more than that, the father says in verse 18,

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 "I asked your disciples to cast out the demon, and they were not able."

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 The chaos is also because the disciples were unable to help this boy.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 And what's the reason given for why they couldn't help?

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Jesus immediately rebukes everyone in verse 19, saying,

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 "Calling them a faithless generation, and that's not without reason."

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 The disciples were unable to help because they lacked faith.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And it's not only the disciples who are faithless.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 The boy's father also didn't believe.

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 As he goes to Jesus, we see a lot of desperation in him,

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 but not much faith so far.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 There's not much faith that he truly believes that Jesus can help him.

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And so far, we've only heard from him that the disciples were unable to do anything.

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Let's read on from verse 20.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 [reading]

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 See, Jesus didn't like hearing what the dad said.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 "If you can." Jesus picks up on this immediately.

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 "If you can help me."

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 That betrays the dad's inner doubts about him.

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The dad's verbally hedging his bets that Jesus can help him.

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 He doesn't fully believe that this is possible.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Compare this dad to the others that we've heard about in the past weeks.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 Paul preached on Mark 5 a few weeks ago.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 There was a woman who fought through the crowd to touch Jesus

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 because she believed that if I touch even his garment, I will be made well.

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 We also heard of the centurion who asked Jesus to heal his servant.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 He said, "I'm unworthy for you to come into my house,

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 but you have authority just like how I, the centurion, has authority over my soldiers."

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 The centurion says, "Go," and the soldiers go.

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Similarly, Jesus can say, "Be healed," and he will be healed.

162
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 At that Jesus marvel, truly I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith.

163
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 Remember the leper in Mark 1.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 He came to the Jesus with faith, saying that if you will, you can make me clean.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 You can make me clean.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 He trusted. He knew that Jesus could heal him.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 The leper's question is, "Are you willing, Jesus?"

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 Instead, the father says, "Can you do it? Can you even do this? Are you able?"

169
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 The dad lacks faith, and Jesus calls him out for it.

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 But then we get to verse 24, and this is a crucial point in the story.

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 This is a key point.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 It goes like this.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 "Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, 'I believe. Help my unbelief.'"

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 These are the key words today.

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 "I believe. Help my unbelief."

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 If you remember just three words today, remember this.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 "Help my unbelief."

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 I can sympathize a bit with the dad.

179
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 It's understandable why he has doubts.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 Number one, he's dealing with this demon in his son for so long.

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 In verse 24, Jesus asks the father, "How long has this been happening to him?"

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 And the father says, "From childhood."

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 That has to be stressful.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 For years and years, the dad watched in pain as the demon broke down his son and destroyed the one he loves.

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 For years, he was unable to do anything.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Then he hears of this miracle worker, Jesus.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 This guy can make the blind see. He can make the lame walk. He can cast out demons.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And his disciples were doing the same.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 So he brings his son over, hoping that they can heal him.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 But what happens?

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 They can't do it. The disciples are useless.

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 And in that case, it may be understandable to think,

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 if the disciples can't do it, maybe it's all just a sham.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 Maybe Jesus can't do it either.

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 I don't know.

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 And on top of that, when they bring the son to Jesus, it gets even worse.

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 In verse 20, it says, "When the spirit saw Jesus, immediately it convulsed the boy,

198
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 and he fell to the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth."

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 So far, it looks like turning to Jesus didn't help anything.

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 And if anything, it made the situation even worse.

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And I wonder if we felt that way about anything like that before in our lives.

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 It's something that we've wanted or prayed about for a while,

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 but yet nothing happened.

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 It's one thing to know God and trust him in our heads,

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 but it's also a constant fight to live it out by faith day by day.

206
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Those who know me know that I love God's sovereignty.

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 That is a truth that I find my joy and rest in, in God's promises.

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 I know that God works all things for the good of those who love him,

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 that he will supply every need of yours,

210
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus.

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 But I have to admit that sometimes my faith wavers.

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 For example, a while back, I had problems with a romantic relationship.

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I wanted it to work out one way and had some hopes and expectations for it,

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 but when things didn't go the way I want, I got anxious and worried.

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 I had my eyes set on an uncertain situation

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 rather than on the unshakable promises of God.

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 I needed to pray, "Lord, I believe, I do believe.

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 Help my unbelief.

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 I know, God, that you will never leave me or forsake me.

220
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 I know that the Lord is my helper. I will not fear.

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 What can man do to me?"

222
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 But on the other hand, I need to say, "Father, I'm weak, I'm short-sighted,

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 and I need you. Help my unbelief."

224
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Like this dad, are there troubles in your life

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 that cause you to doubt God's goodness?

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Maybe a loved one that's sick, could be dating, relationships.

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 Maybe you've been praying for years and years and nothing's happened.

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 For parents, maybe like this dad, you pray for your son or daughter.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 Perhaps they took a wrong turn at some point.

230
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 They're chasing after the world and turned away from God.

231
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 You've been praying for years and nothing happened.

232
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 I invite all of us to turn to Jesus and pray as the dad prayed.

233
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 "I believe. Help my unbelief."

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 I've prayed to him. I've been discouraged. It's been years, Lord,

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 and I've seen nothing changed.

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Or maybe the situation just caught me by surprise. I don't know what to do.

237
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 I want to pray, but I don't even know how to pray.

238
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 But even so, we can pray. "Help my unbelief."

239
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Jesus hears these prayers and he comforts those who are weak and weary.

240
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 He helps us even when our faith is weak.

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 And I think that also is what true faith actually is.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 When we recognize that we are weak and we can't save ourselves,

243
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 that we need Jesus and then cry out to him for help.

244
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 Maybe also there's some of us here that don't know Jesus yet or believe in him.

245
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 Or you've heard about him recently and want to believe.

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 You could be or you could have been attending church for a while,

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 but still you know that something's missing about your faith.

248
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 You don't really worship God or you see how others worship

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 and you know somehow you don't love him the same way.

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Maybe at the back of your mind there's nagging doubts.

251
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 You're not sure whether God really exists or whether he truly loves you and cares for you.

252
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Perhaps you're at a crossroads and you either need to be cut to the heart with the gospel

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 or you're ready to give it up entirely.

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 If that's the case with you, I also invite you to pray. "Help my unbelief."

255
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Even if you can't say, "I believe," you can still say, "I don't believe, but I want to. Help my unbelief."

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Take that step however small to seek Jesus.

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And that step of saying, "I can't do it. Help me, God," when said earnestly,

258
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 is part of what true faith actually is.

259
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Faith sees that we need a savior. We can't save ourselves, so we cry out to him.

260
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 1 Peter 5 says, "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God,

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 so that at the proper time he may exalt you,

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 casting all your anxieties on him because he cares for you."

264
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 You see, Jesus comes, he invites us to come to him as we are.

265
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Even if we don't believe in him, even when our faith is weak, we can call out to him.

266
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 "Help my unbelief." Jesus helps us when we're weak.

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Secondly, Jesus answers and works to build our faith.

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 He helps us when we're weak, but he also works to build our faith up.

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 Let's read on from verse 25.

270
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 See, long story short, Jesus managed to cast the demon out and heal the boy. Nice.

271
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 But before that, the dad went through a long journey.

272
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 The dad was disappointed by the disciple's uselessness.

273
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 He was on his knees and also desperately pleading with Jesus,

274
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 only to be greeted with a rebuke.

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 Then as Jesus went to his son and claimed to cast out the demon,

276
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 now the spirit convulsed and afflicted the boy even more,

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 to the point that the boy appeared to be dead even.

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 The boy appeared to be dead.

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Now Jesus could have healed the boy immediately.

280
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 He was certainly able to.

281
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Or if God didn't permit it in the first place, the demon would have no power over the son.

282
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 But I think that Jesus allowed all of this to happen for a reason.

283
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 In order to bring the dad to the point where he had no other choice but to cry out to Jesus,

284
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 saying, "Help my unbelief."

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 He used suffering to refine this dad's faith.

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And in the same way, God also uses trials and suffering in our life to draw us to him.

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 1 Peter 1:6 says,

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 God uses suffering to refine our faith so that we could have this eternal joy,

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 this thing that is precious.

290
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 We observed earlier that there are two problems in this passage.

291
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 The first is that there is a demon-possessed boy,

292
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 and the second is that there is unbelief.

293
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 If we also zoom out to look more broadly at the Gospels,

294
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 we see that there are two big things that Jesus has been doing so far.

295
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 Number one is that he has been performing miracles,

296
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 mainly healing people and casting out demons, as with the boy here.

297
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 Number two, he has been preaching and proclaiming the kingdom of God.

298
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 Mark 1 says,

299
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 But if we squint at it, both actions, the healing and the preaching,

300
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 are actually part of the same mission.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 They both serve to testify of who Jesus is.

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 First, he is revealed as someone who is sent by God to declare his kingdom coming.

303
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Jesus is a prophet declaring the kingdom of God.

304
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 And then later, as his ministry progresses,

305
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 it is revealed that Jesus, this prophet, is also the Christ, the Messiah,

306
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 who will save the world.

307
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 He is the one who is anointed and chosen by God to save his people.

308
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 So Jesus both declares the Gospel with words in his preaching,

309
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 and then performs signs and wonders to confirm that his message is credible.

310
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 The heart of Jesus, both in his healing and preaching,

311
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 is that Jesus wants people to believe in him

312
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 and have faith that he will redeem them from their sins.

313
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And here we see that Jesus healed because he is compassionate.

314
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 That is true.

315
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 The Father appeals to that, asking Jesus in verse 22,

316
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 "Have compassion on us."

317
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And a couple weeks ago, we also heard about how Jesus healed the leper in Mark 1

318
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 because he was moved with pity and compassion for him, the leper.

319
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But his compassion isn't only for physical illnesses.

320
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 It surely is.

321
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 But it's also towards our unbelief.

322
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Because Mark 6, 34 says,

323
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 "When Jesus went ashore, he saw a great crowd,

324
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 "and he had compassion on them,

325
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 "because they were like sheep without a shepherd."

326
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 These people were like sheep without a shepherd

327
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 because of their lack of faith, because of unbelief.

328
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 They didn't know God and lost their way as a result.

329
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 And Jesus had compassion on them for that reason,

330
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 because of their lack of faith.

331
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 And then out of his compassion, what does he do?

332
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 He began to teach them many things.

333
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 He taught them out of compassion for their unbelief.

334
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And the point is this,

335
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 that Jesus heals not out of only compassion towards physical illnesses,

336
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 but also from compassion towards our spiritual illnesses,

337
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 towards our lack of faith.

338
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 His ministry of healing works alongside his ministry of proclamation.

339
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 His miracles testify that Jesus, he is the real deal,

340
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 that what he says is true.

341
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 In Mark 1, Jesus was teaching in the synagogue,

342
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 and all of a sudden, another demon-possessed man interrupts

343
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 and causes a commotion.

344
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 And then Jesus commands the spirit, saying,

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 "Be silent and come out of him."

346
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 And the spirit obeys.

347
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Later in verse 27, it says,

348
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 "That they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying,

349
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 'What is this, a new teaching with authority?

350
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.'"

351
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 The one who has authority over the demon to say,

352
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 "Be silent and come out of him,"

353
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 that Jesus has the same authority to say to us,

354
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

355
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 The miracles testify that Jesus is sent from God.

356
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 And now it's also interesting that when the dad asks, "Help my unbelief,"

357
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 how does Jesus respond?

358
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 He responds by healing the boy.

359
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 And now perhaps Jesus answered that cry by giving the dad faith

360
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 that made the healing possible,

361
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 but I consider the act of healing itself

362
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 to be an answer to the dad's prayer of helping his unbelief.

363
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Jesus addresses the dad's unbelief by doing what he said he could do.

364
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 He showed that he was able to heal precisely by healing the boy,

365
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 by the act of healing him.

366
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 He showed himself worthy of our faith.

367
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 That's how he helped the dad's unbelief.

368
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 And I think the same is true also when we talk about healing

369
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 and other miraculous works of the spirit today,

370
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 or how God answers our prayers.

371
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 He answers because God loves us and is compassionate towards us,

372
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 but he's not just compassionate towards our physical ailments.

373
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 He wants to strengthen our faith in him.

374
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 And there's some of us here who can testify to how they came to know God

375
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 more closely when he healed them or a loved one.

376
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 I think of Florence's family. That's one example.

377
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 I'm sure there's other testimonies.

378
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 But the miracles and gifts of the spirit are not ends in themselves.

379
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 They're gifts given to build up the church

380
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 and to demonstrate that Jesus is who he really claimed to be.

381
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 As Hebrews 2 says,

382
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 So that's why there's signs and wonders performed by Jesus and maybe now today.

383
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 And what's this great salvation declared in Hebrews 2?

384
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 What's the message that God confirms with signs and wonders?

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 If we read on in Mark 2, verse 31, Jesus tells his disciples,

386
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 You see, Jesus' mission wasn't just to preach and heal.

387
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 His ultimate mission was to die on the cross for our sins.

388
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 Jesus came to put death to death and to make an end of our sins.

389
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 Jesus, the innocent son of man and son of God,

390
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 was murdered on the cross for our sake.

391
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 He willingly gave his life up for us and bore the wrath of God on our behalf

392
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 so that all who believe in him would be forgiven of their sins.

393
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And Jesus didn't just die, but he performed the ultimate miracle on the third day.

394
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 He rose from the dead, proving that he is the son of God

395
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and that he is worthy of our faith,

396
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 that he is worthy for us to deny ourselves, take up our cross and follow him.

397
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 Just as Jesus raised the boy in verse 27 and proved that he is able to heal,

398
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 Jesus rose from the dead and demonstrated that he is worthy of our full trust and adoration.

399
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 And so, because Jesus died and rose, we can cry to him,

400
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 "I believe, help my unbelief."

401
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Jesus died and rose from the dead to purchase for us this prayer, "Help my unbelief."

402
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 These healings, these miracles are witnesses and signs.

403
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 They are a shadow of the good thing that has come.

404
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Every healing is an act of God's mercy.

405
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Every prayer answered, a testament to God's goodness.

406
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 Every miracle, an announcement that God's kingdom is here and that there's more to come.

407
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 They point us forward to the day when all is made new,

408
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 to look forward to that day when we will see God face to face

409
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 and hear that he will dwell with them and they will be his people,

410
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 and God himself will be with them as their God.

411
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 He will wipe every tear from their eyes and death will be no more.

412
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore,

413
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 for the former things have passed away.

414
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And we will all praise him for all eternity, saying, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain."

415
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 That's what Jesus bought for us.

416
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And when Jesus answers our prayers, when he does signs and wonders,

417
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 by rising from the dead, Jesus helps our unbelief.

418
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 So we see that Jesus helps us when we're weak in faith, firstly.

419
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 And secondly, Jesus also works to build up our faith.

420
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 He did it by his atoning death on the cross,

421
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 and he also did it by healing this boy and answering this dad's prayers.

422
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 Lastly, thirdly, we see that Jesus also helps us when we ask him in faith.

423
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Let's read from verse 28.

424
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 "And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him in private,

425
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 'Why could we not cast it out?'

426
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 And he said to them, 'This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer.'"

427
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Remember we saw earlier that the disciples weren't able to cast out the demon,

428
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 and they were wondering why.

429
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 They asked Jesus, and he answers them,

430
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 "Guys, you need to pray. You need to pray."

431
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And isn't that kind of funny that the disciples tried to cast out a demon,

432
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 a literal demon, without thinking to pray?

433
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Imagine that, the disciples rocking up to an exorcism, forgetting to pray.

434
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 There's a demon-possessed boy. He's going crazy.

435
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 They can't control him. They can't do anything.

436
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 Nothing is working.

437
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And still somehow, they neglect to pray.

438
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 Why is that?

439
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Matthew gives a parallel account of this story.

440
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 There, the disciples ask the same question in Matthew 17, verse 19.

441
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 They ask, "Why could we not cast it out?"

442
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 And Jesus replies, "Because of your little faith.

443
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed,

444
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,'

445
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you."

446
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 In other words, Jesus is saying that if you have faith, then you will pray.

447
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 And God will listen, and he will act.

448
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Nothing is impossible for God.

449
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 See, the disciples couldn't cast out the demon because they lacked faith.

450
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 And because they had little faith, they didn't pray.

451
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 And now, before we get too smug of ourselves,

452
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 making fun of the disciples for trying to exorcise a demon without praying,

453
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 we also ought to examine ourselves as well.

454
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 Do we always pray as earnestly as we ought to pray?

455
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 Or maybe, like the disciples, we're looking a bit silly sometimes.

456
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 And I'll be the first to say, I don't pray enough.

457
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 Honestly, when preparing to preach for today, I was staring at this passage,

458
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 working hard to understand it, reading, trying to organize my thoughts.

459
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 And then it hit me. I just really needed to pray

460
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 in order to understand and deliver to you what God had to say.

461
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 Nothing I say has power unless God's Spirit works in your hearts, works in our hearts.

462
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 I've also even caught myself sharing the Gospel recently

463
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 without adequate prayer, without stopping to pray.

464
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 And that's crazy, isn't it?

465
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Because it's God who removes the veil from blind eyes and shines light into dark hearts.

466
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 We can do nothing without God.

467
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 And if we really trust Jesus when he says that,

468
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 "I am the vine, you are the branches.

469
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 "Abide in me and I in you, and you will bear much fruit.

470
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 "Apart from me, you can do nothing."

471
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 If we trust that, and if we trust that it is God who works in us,

472
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 both to will and to work for our good pleasure,

473
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 then we need to pray.

474
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 And if we don't pray, if we don't pray like this, then we can pray.

475
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Help my unbelief.

476
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Psalm 127 says,

477
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 "Unless the Lord builds a house, those who build it labor in vain.

478
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 "Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchmen stay awake in vain.

479
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 "It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest."

480
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 And I add to that, that's all because we do not pray.

481
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 And so we need to pray.

482
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 Help my unbelief.

483
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 Help my unbelief.

484
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 Why would we want to do anything without asking God to help us?

485
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 He promises that with faith the size of even a mustard seed,

486
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 even the tiniest smidgen of faith, God will move mountains for us.

487
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Do we believe this or are we trying to move the mountain ourselves?

488
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 Imagine hiking up Dragon's Back with a shovel in one hand

489
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 and a metal bucket in the other,

490
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 thinking because if this mountain is going to move anywhere,

491
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 I've got to start digging.

492
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 It's all on me, one scoop at a time to do this.

493
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And while we're sweating and driving our shovel in the ground,

494
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 we wonder why is this such difficult work?

495
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 Why is this so hard?

496
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Why am I sweating so much?

497
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 That's the picture when we try to do things without prayer.

498
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 God could send all of Hong Kong Island to Macau with so much as a word.

499
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 He wouldn't even have to lift a finger.

500
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 And this same God is waiting to hear our prayers.

501
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 He's waiting to work on our behalf.

502
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 Isaiah 64 says, "For since the world began, no eye has heard,

503
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 "no ear has heard, and no eye has seen a God like you

504
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 "who works for those who wait for him."

505
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Church, our God listens when we pray, and he loves to hear our prayers.

506
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 He hears and he acts according to his good pleasure.

507
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 So we need to pray.

508
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Last thing, how do we pray in faith?

509
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 What does that mean?

510
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 First, what it is, and then what it isn't.

511
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 We should pray with faith that God is both able and willing to answer our prayers,

512
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 that God is able.

513
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 Faith doesn't say, like the dad, "If you can do anything."

514
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 Faith says, "You can do anything.

515
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 "I believe you, God.

516
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 "You can heal him.

517
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 "You can save her.

518
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 "You can do it without even lifting a finger."

519
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 And if you can't pray that, if we can't believe that,

520
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 then we already know what to pray.

521
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 "Help my unbelief.

522
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 "I want to pray more.

523
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 "Help my unbelief."

524
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 Praying with faith is knowing not just that God is able,

525
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 but that he's also willing to hear our prayers.

526
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 We know we have boldness and access to God with confidence through our faith in Christ.

527
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
 And we can pray for things that God is pleased to do.

528
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 This doesn't mean that God will necessarily do all that we ask all the time.

529
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 For example, not everyone will be saved,

530
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 even though God desires that all people to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.

531
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 But we can still ask him in confidence that he loves to save.

532
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Or we will continue to sin in this life,

533
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 but we can still pray with confidence that God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.

534
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 So we can pray according to God's will for the things that please him.

535
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 And we can know what is God's will by reading his word and storing it up in our hearts

536
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 so that we're transformed by the renewal of our minds,

537
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 that by testing, we may discern what is the will of God.

538
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 And so we can pray accordingly.

539
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 Let's pray with faith that God is both able and willing to answer our prayers.

540
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 And now, what isn't?

541
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 So praying with faith isn't some new age, self-help type of prayer

542
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 where we just manifest and conjure up the life that we want.

543
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Faith doesn't come up from false hope in whatever outcome we want

544
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 and then deluding ourselves to believe it.

545
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 There's no promise that we can name and claim whatever we want.

546
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 There's no guarantee that we will be rich if we believe hard enough

547
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 or that that person will surely be healed.

548
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 And if we deceive ourselves, God doesn't promise that he'll play along.

549
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Instead, faith is the confident assurance of truth, the hope of realities, of substance,

550
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 not just whims and illusions.

551
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 And we can guard ourselves with praying based on the truth revealed in God's word

552
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 and by testing our desires and our prayers according to it.

553
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And as we pray and we surrender our will to God,

554
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 I believe that God's spirit is able, that he does and can give a special revelation

555
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 or a gift of faith as he sees fit so that we know how to pray for a specific outcome.

556
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 Perhaps to know that particular person will be healed.

557
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 That's a gift that God gives.

558
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 We can ask God in prayer to give us some special gift of faith.

559
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 And if he gives us that gift, if he gives us that assurance,

560
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 then we can pray with confident assurance that we have received it

561
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 just as his spirit has revealed to us.

562
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 But if not, then I don't think it's wise to conjure up, to create confidence

563
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 in something that God has not given us reason to be confident about.

564
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 I don't think that's what it means to pray in faith.

565
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 But to sum it all up, again today, we've been looking at the heart of Jesus that comforts.

566
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Jesus comforts us by meeting us where we are, even when we're weak.

567
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 He helps us when we're weak and lacking in faith.

568
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 He invites us to call on him and to trust in him in our weakness.

569
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 But he doesn't let us stay weak. He doesn't keep us weak.

570
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 He works to build up our faith.

571
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 He uses both blessings and trials in our life to show that he's trustworthy.

572
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 And the greatest miracle that he did for us was dying on the cross for our sins

573
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 and rising on the third day.

574
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And finally, when we have faith, when we have this true trust in Jesus,

575
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 we can find comfort that God really hears our prayers when we pray with faith.

576
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 He hears us and he listens and he acts.

577
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 So let's pray more. Let's cry to him, "Help my unbelief."

578
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 For some of us here, the prayers might be, "I don't believe. Help my unbelief."

579
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 For others, it's, "I know you. I know you, God. I believe you, Father.

580
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 Help my unbelief. Help me to trust you more. I want to love you more every day.

581
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 I want to see you more beautifully every day. Help my unbelief."

582
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 And as fitting, we're going to pray now, but I'm going to ask the band today to remain seated

583
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 because today we're all going to focus and pray together as a church.

584
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 We're not praying after the sermon to stall for time, to set up for a smooth transition.

585
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 We're praying because we trust that God hears our prayers.

586
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 And if there's an awkward silence when they come up later, that's fine.

587
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 We can continue to pray while they set up.

588
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 We can pray individually in silence.

589
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 And we're going to pray like this today because we believe.

590
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 We believe that God hears our prayers, that he listens, that he loves us and cares for us.

591
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 He comforts us.

592
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 And if we don't believe that today, then right now we can pray, "Help my unbelief."

593
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 So let's pray.

594
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 Father, we look to you.

595
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Some of us here can't say we believe in God, but we, God, we ask,

596
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 we trust that you know your sheep, you know your people, you love to save.

597
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 If there's anyone here today that needs to cry, "Help my unbelief, Lord,"

598
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 we pray that you would answer that prayer for them,

599
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 that they would see Christ, call on him by faith, and be saved.

600
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 We trust that your Spirit can do that, that you shine light into dark hearts.

601
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 For us, the church, God, we also pray that you would teach us to pray.

602
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 We confess, we repent that we don't pray as we ought to.

603
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 God, we ask, "Help our unbelief. Help us. Give us more faith to pray, to pray big things,

604
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 to trust, to know in confidence that you hear our prayers, that you are God,

605
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 that you're bigger than all our problems, that you're able and willing to help us."

606
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 God, we pray for our church in this new season,

607
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 that you would work, not just to make this transition to Sunday smooth,

608
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 but that, God, this would be the beginning of a great new season that you're doing in our church,

609
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 that you would make us a church that goes and makes disciples of all nations,

610
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 that is passionate, that is on fire to see people come to know you,

611
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 to see disciples being raised,

612
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 that we would be bold to go preach the gospel to our coworkers, our friends, to draw people to you,

613
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 and that we would desire to get to know you more, that we'd be passionate to worship you,

614
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
 that we would be a church that is a light in the city,

615
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
 that the city, your spirit would move in all of us,

616
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 just to love you, to worship you,

617
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 and that you would send us out to the ends of the earth where Christ has not been named,

618
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 to preach Christ to peoples that don't know you.

619
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 We pray for governments and authorities that oppress your church.

620
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 We pray that your spirit would move in their hearts to repent,

621
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 that they would be our brothers and sisters,

622
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 that they would confess Christ, they would call on his name and be saved.

623
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 We trust that you can do this, that you love to save all people.

624
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,000
 And so, Lord, help us to pray more.

625
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 Help us to pray as we go into work, as we go into school,

626
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 in everything that we do, the work we do with our hands.

627
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 When work gets tough, Lord, help us to pray.

628
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 Teach us to pray even when we're at work 10 hours a day,

629
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 focusing on what's in front of us.

630
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 Teach us to pray.

631
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Teach us to pray for our friends, our families, our coworkers that don't know you.

632
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 To fall on our knees and beg that you can heal them,

633
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 help my unbelief, you can heal them, you can save them.

634
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
 And, Lord, would you answer.

635
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 God, we pray that we would be a praying church,

636
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 a church that calls on you by faith, that sees you.

637
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 Lord, you are able to work in our hearts.

638
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 So we pray, help our unbelief, help us to see you more, Lord.

639
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 We pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.

640
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,840
 Amen.

641
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:04,840
