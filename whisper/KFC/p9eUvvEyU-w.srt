1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
 Good, good.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,480
 So good to be able to preach to you all, not via a camera.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,880
 You've all got your masks on, so I can't see you.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,880
 Really good to see you all.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,880
 Hope you're all doing well.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,880
 Hope you're all going to be staying safe in these next couple of weeks or months.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,720
 We actually had to finish the last series on Ephesians online.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,760
 It was about identity, about who do we think we are.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,160
 We finished it talking about putting on the whole armour of God.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,800
 And then Pastor John last week started us off on a new series leading up to Easter called

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,120
 Jesus is King.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,520
 Nothing to do, no connection with Kanye West's latest album.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,840
 But this idea of heading up to Easter and really digging into who Jesus is and what

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,460
 the gospels say about him.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,080
 And he went through, and John went through the genealogy of Jesus.

16
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,120
 He went from the 14 generations from Abraham to David, and then from the 14 generations

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,520
 from David to the deportation to Babylon, and then another 14 generations from Babylon

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,360
 to Jesus' birth.

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,840
 And that was Matthew chapter 1.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,940
 And today, and that was the King's record.

21
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,920
 And today I want to be talking about the King's rise.

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,440
 The genealogy really showed us that mankind, the history of mankind was all pointing to

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,120
 one point.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,240
 The arrival of the King, the Kingdom of Heaven arriving on earth.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,240
 Matthew chapters 3 and 4 talks to us about Jesus announcing his ministry to the world.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,600
 This is Jesus beginning his story, the King's rise.

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,000
 And John last week gave us four different points about the genealogy.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,400
 And today I'm going to give you the four A's about the King's rise.

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,760
 Of course, these two chapters are huge, and there's so much in there, there could be at

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,280
 least a whole series in these two chapters.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,440
 But I'm going to split this into four very simple parts, the four A's.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,920
 The first about the King's rise is there is an announcement, and then there is an approval

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,920
 process.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,160
 He's announced, and then he's approved, and then he is assessed, and finally he assembles.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,920
 And as we look at this, as we look at how Jesus rises, I hope that it's of an encouragement

36
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,760
 to you that Jesus is King, even though outside it's very uncertain, that Jesus remains sovereign

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,560
 and is ruling and is King.

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,320
 So the first one is this.

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,920
 Jesus is announced.

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,720
 Matthew chapter 3, verse 2 says this.

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,800
 There's a guy who's in the wilderness, and he shouts this phrase, verse 2, "Repent, for

42
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,160
 the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
 Who is this guy?

44
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,280
 John the Baptist.

45
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,480
 Matthew is writing about John the Baptist.

46
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,480
 He's saying, "Repent, and the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,560
 That kingdom of heaven word is basically the same as kingdom of God.

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,160
 But it's interesting here because Matthew was writing to the Jewish people, and he knew

49
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,880
 that the Jewish people really are uncomfortable with the word God.

50
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,960
 So instead of saying the kingdom of God, he would say the kingdom of heaven.

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,420
 They're really the same things.

52
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,200
 And you know Matthew is talking to the Jewish people because then he writes the next verse,

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,400
 he quotes the prophet Isaiah.

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,420
 Isaiah 40, verse 3 says this, and Matthew writes this in the next verse, "The voice

55
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,920
 of one crying in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord.

56
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,680
 Make his path straight.'"

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,960
 What he's telling the Jews here is that that guy that you've been waiting for, that guy

58
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,040
 that you have been expecting to come and rescue you, he is here.

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,560
 The time is now, Jewish people.

60
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
 Do you get it?

61
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,740
 Do you know that it is him?

62
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,580
 He's confirming to them this is the guy now.

63
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,680
 And who's announcing this?

64
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,080
 John the Baptist.

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,200
 Incredibly counter-cultural model of sacrificial obedience.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,960
 A crazy man is what we would say about him if we saw him in the streets.

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,720
 He wore camel's hair.

68
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,280
 He lived in the wilderness and he ate locust and honey for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

69
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,520
 An incredibly strange man.

70
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,720
 But he is the one that was chosen to announce the arrival of the king.

71
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,440
 And I want to talk a little bit about John the Baptist because he's a very interesting

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,440
 man.

73
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,520
 He gave up his life to announce, to make the path straight.

74
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,080
 And he was ferocious.

75
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,880
 And you could see him talking to the Israelites.

76
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,200
 And this passage carries on.

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,900
 He's telling them to repent.

78
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,480
 You guys, you think that you're going to be saved because Abraham is your granddaddy,

79
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,960
 granddaddy, granddaddy.

80
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
 But you're not.

81
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,520
 And he's telling them, "Bear fruits in keeping with repentance."

82
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,040
 He's saying, "If you really are genuinely saved, I need to see some fruits.

83
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,200
 There has to be some difference in your life."

84
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
 And at the moment, there isn't.

85
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,320
 And if there isn't, one day, someone is going to come and they're going to throw you in

86
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,640
 the fire.

87
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,280
 So he's got this boldness and courage about him.

88
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
 He's fierce.

89
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,440
 And yet, there's another side.

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,780
 Whilst he's declaring all this, and this is where I really want you to imagine listening

91
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,780
 to this guy in the wilderness.

92
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,420
 And he's getting quite a crowd.

93
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,060
 Quite a lot of people are coming to hear this message and repenting and getting baptized

94
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,060
 by him.

95
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,980
 But whilst he has that strength and that popularity and he's drawing people in, there's another

96
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,980
 side to that.

97
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,900
 Whilst there is ferocity, there's also this sense of humility.

98
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,620
 Because he says this, "I baptize you with water for repentance."

99
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,780
 But there's going to be coming someone who's going to baptize you with the Holy Spirit.

100
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,020
 And this guy, this guy, I can't even fill his shoes.

101
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
 Forget it.

102
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,100
 I'm not even allowed to carry his shoes.

103
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,300
 I'm unworthy to carry his sandals.

104
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,780
 This guy is Jesus.

105
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,380
 And you better be ready because he is coming and he is here.

106
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,380
 Be ready.

107
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,340
 Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

108
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,640
 And so imagine this scene.

109
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,320
 He's by the water in the wilderness.

110
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
 He's giving this message, a powerful message.

111
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,360
 People are repenting.

112
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,120
 And then lo and behold, Jesus himself comes and joins the gathering.

113
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,980
 He comes and joins the gathering and then he walks through the crowds.

114
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,280
 He walks to the water.

115
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,440
 He goes up to John and asks John to baptize him.

116
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,720
 Can you imagine just a moment what John would be doing in his camel's hair with locusts

117
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
 still on his mouth?

118
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,600
 "What do you mean, me baptize you?

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,160
 You should be baptizing me.

120
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,160
 You're Jesus.

121
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
 You're our Messiah.

122
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
 You're the Savior."

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,720
 And then Jesus says this.

124
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,360
 He says, "Let it be so.

125
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,480
 Baptize me because it is time now to fulfill all righteousness."

126
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:16,320
 Have you ever wondered why Jesus needed to be baptized?

127
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,080
 The whole point of baptism is to declare that your old ways are gone and that your new life

128
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,920
 is beginning.

129
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,080
 But Jesus didn't need to repent from his old ways.

130
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,320
 Jesus was God.

131
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,320
 He was flawless.

132
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,840
 He was sinless.

133
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,680
 So why did he have to be baptized?

134
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,480
 Why did he come at this moment as a 30-year-old man to come into the wilderness to be baptized

135
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,640
 by this crazy man?

136
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
 What was Jesus actually doing?

137
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,480
 And I think the hint is in the Scriptures.

138
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,800
 Three verse 11 says this.

139
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,200
 When John was saying, "I baptize you with water for," what?

140
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
 "Repentance."

141
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
 So I think there's two points here.

142
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,340
 This word repentance isn't regret.

143
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,480
 When you do something wrong, you're like, "Oh my goodness.

144
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,840
 I really shouldn't have done that.

145
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,280
 I should have known better.

146
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,920
 I just feel so bad and guilty about this.

147
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
 I'm sorry.

148
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
 You apologize to whoever you wronged."

149
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,280
 That's not really repentance.

150
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,320
 That's just regret.

151
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,000
 Repentance is saying, "I was going this way and I now recognize that it's completely wrong

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,040
 and now I'm going to go this way."

153
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,640
 It's turning from your old ways and obeying God.

154
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,880
 And what Jesus is doing here in this act of baptism when he didn't really need to, he

155
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,960
 was modeling to us true obedience.

156
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,920
 He was modeling to us true obedience.

157
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,920
 Why?

158
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,200
 And the second word is this.

159
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,720
 And it says here, Jesus says, "To fulfill all righteousness."

160
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,520
 Righteousness.

161
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,760
 Jesus knows that one day all of us and all of those around the sea at that time, one

162
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,400
 day will be face to face with our Creator and righteousness will be demanded of us.

163
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,880
 But he knows that we all fall short of the glory of God.

164
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:01,920
 In this moment of being baptized, what he's doing is he's identifying with mankind, identifying

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:10,520
 with flawed humanity, identifying with Israel and saying, "I am here to fulfill all righteousness.

166
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,080
 My righteousness I give to you."

167
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,160
 That song that Florence sang at the end, "Dressed in righteousness alone."

168
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,120
 That is what we're going to be when we meet our Creator, dressed in his righteousness.

169
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,880
 2 Corinthians says this, "He made him who knew no sin to be sin."

170
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,880
 Why?

171
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,880
 So that we could be the righteousness of God.

172
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,800
 So what Jesus is doing as he gets baptized, he's showing us what total obedience looks

173
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:41,240
 like and he's also identifying with us, thereby qualifying as our Messiah.

174
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,000
 That he was coming to save us.

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,600
 And once we are baptized in him with the Holy Spirit, his righteousness now becomes ours.

176
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
 So there we have it.

177
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,080
 Jesus is announced by John the Baptist.

178
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,240
 The second point is this, is approved.

179
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,480
 From the moment he gets baptized and then he gets lifted out of the water, an incredible

180
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,720
 scene happens.

181
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,600
 Probably the defining moment of humanity.

182
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,760
 What happens?

183
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,880
 The verse goes, "The heavens open and then the Spirit of God descends upon him like a

184
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:21,240
 dove and a voice comes from heaven and says, 'Behold, this is my beloved Son with whom

185
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,240
 I am well pleased.'"

186
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,080
 Pause.

187
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,160
 The heavens opened.

188
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,520
 I've seen clouds open and a bit of sun come.

189
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,480
 The heavens opened.

190
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,560
 Can you imagine being there?

191
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,280
 The heavens opened up and then the Spirit of God comes down on Jesus like a dove.

192
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,000
 If you're a Jewish person, what does a dove mean to you?

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,680
 A dove means peace.

194
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,240
 A dove means Genesis chapter 8.

195
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,400
 It means Noah and the flood.

196
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,120
 It means the dove that symbolizes the new era.

197
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,520
 You can see this dove descending on this man and you can see a new era being ushered in.

198
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,360
 And then you hear a voice, maybe even Morgan Freeman style voice.

199
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,760
 "Behold, this is my Son."

200
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,440
 I do not have such a low voice to do Morgan Freeman.

201
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,600
 It's more like David Beckham for me and the accent is wrong.

202
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,800
 "Behold, this is my Son, my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased."

203
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,880
 Have you watched those movies where at the beginning of the movie is a narrator and it's

204
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,000
 kind of like this.

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,840
 Once there lived a boy named Charlie and he loved chocolate.

206
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,400
 And a lot of films start like this.

207
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,280
 And you have a narrator, again, just a very husky voice that starts this whole story off.

208
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,920
 And then once the narrating finishes, the story begins and then you follow the main

209
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,400
 character Charlie and then he goes through ups and downs in life.

210
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,040
 But then you know that the narrator at the beginning that set the scene, you know that

211
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,880
 Charlie is going to be fine because the narrator is telling the story and the narrator lived

212
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,960
 to tell the story.

213
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:08,920
 So you know at some point, even with all these ups and downs, Charlie is going to be fine.

214
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,800
 And I think this is a little bit similar because I'm trying to imagine if I was there and I

215
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,880
 heard this voice come from heaven and this voice was saying, "Behold, this is my beloved

216
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,960
 Son with whom I am well pleased."

217
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,280
 For me, this is the beginning of Jesus' story.

218
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,000
 But I think the beginning points to the end.

219
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,840
 It foretells the end because what I'm seeing, if I see the heavens open and this dove land

220
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,560
 on this man over there and a voice coming out to shout something, I'm thinking, "Whoever

221
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,040
 that guy is, he's got heaven on his side.

222
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:44,360
 So whatever he is here to do, whatever mission he's on, he's going to succeed."

223
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,400
 Can you see that?

224
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,600
 God revealed himself through his voice, through the heavens opening already.

225
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,400
 He already proclaimed his victory.

226
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,920
 He was already very well pleased with his Son who was obedient, who had followed him.

227
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,240
 That statement in itself is packed.

228
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,920
 This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased.

229
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,920
 Again, the Jews, if they knew their scripture, they would go straight back to Isaiah chapter

230
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,920
 42.

231
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
 I think we have this.

232
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,680
 Isaiah 42, "Behold my servant whom I behold."

233
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,400
 They would see the parallels.

234
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,880
 "Behold, this is my beloved Son."

235
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,160
 This is talking about the chosen servant of Israel.

236
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,240
 They would go to Psalm 2 and see, "Today," the next slide, "you are my Son.

237
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,680
 Today I have begotten you."

238
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,120
 They will see the parallels.

239
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,320
 This man is loved by God.

240
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,480
 And you go even further back.

241
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,160
 For me, this is probably the main one.

242
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,360
 You go to Genesis chapter 22.

243
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,360
 I don't know if you heard this story before.

244
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,720
 There was a guy called Abraham who couldn't have a baby for a very long time until one

245
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,000
 day God gifted him and his wife Sarah a baby, Isaac.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,320
 And the boy grew up.

247
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,960
 And then one day, Abraham is asked by God, "Abraham, take your son Isaac whom you love."

248
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,160
 "And go up to the mountain to worship me."

249
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
 How?

250
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
 To sacrifice Isaac.

251
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,040
 "Sacrifice your only son whom you love."

252
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,320
 And Abraham obeys, takes Isaac up this mountain, puts him on the table, is just about ready

253
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,000
 to sacrifice him, and God stops him.

254
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,680
 He says, "Stop.

255
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,520
 Now I know what is in your heart.

256
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,800
 Now I know that you love me.

257
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,080
 And actually, you don't need to sacrifice the son whom you love.

258
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,960
 There's a lamb that's trapped in the bush over there.

259
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,000
 Take that as a substitute."

260
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,880
 Fast forward all these thousands of years now, God is saying, "Behold, this is my son

261
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,080
 whom I love.

262
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
 And I'm well pleased with him.

263
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,800
 And I'm going to sacrifice him for mankind."

264
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
 What God is saying here is three things.

265
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:49,120
 He's confirming Jesus' identity, his relationship, and his purpose.

266
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,080
 Identity, why?

267
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,960
 God's confirming this man is divine.

268
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
 This man is divine.

269
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,240
 Last time I checked, no human being had heaven open for them and have their voice come down.

270
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,040
 This man is divine.

271
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,720
 What kind of divinity?

272
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,280
 His son, his relationship is that he is God's own son.

273
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,360
 "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son."

274
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,880
 And finally, his mission.

275
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,040
 He was here.

276
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,280
 He came from heaven to earth.

277
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,840
 The kingdom of heaven is at hand because it has arrived now for a mission, and that pleased

278
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
 God.

279
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,920
 Identity, relationship, purpose.

280
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,840
 Jesus is first announced, and then he is approved.

281
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,440
 And as if the heaven's opening wasn't quite strange enough for you, the next stage is

282
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,240
 even more interesting, I find.

283
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,760
 Chapter four begins like this.

284
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,960
 The moment that is finished, "With whom I am well pleased," we jump into chapter four.

285
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:48,520
 And it says this, "Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness.

286
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:53,080
 From there he fasts for 40 days and 40 nights."

287
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:58,800
 And then the most biggest understatement of the year, "And he was hungry."

288
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,960
 He's not eating for 40 days and 40 nights, and he was hungry, I bet.

289
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,480
 And what I said earlier about Jesus kind of identifying with mankind being baptized, he's

290
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
 doing the same here.

291
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,080
 Where the Israelites were trapped in the wilderness for 40 years but failed, Jesus was now going

292
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,460
 to be in the wilderness for 40 days, but he was going to pass.

293
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,480
 And that model of sacrificial obedience that crazy man John the Baptist had, living in

294
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,200
 the wilderness eating locusts and honey, Jesus now looks at that and goes, "I'm going to

295
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,680
 go into the wilderness and I'm going to eat nothing but the Word of God."

296
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,320
 This is an even more intense version of obedience that Jesus is displaying here.

297
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,940
 And there, Jesus is assessed.

298
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,520
 We call this passage the temptation of Jesus.

299
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,640
 This is Jesus coming face to face with the tempter, the enemy, the devil, and he's being

300
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 tested.

301
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,640
 And that's the verb there, really.

302
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,700
 It's tempted, but it's really tested here.

303
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:00,520
 And what this really tells me is when there is a mission, there is also, when there is

304
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,660
 a calling, there is also going to be a testing.

305
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,060
 Jesus is called to come and save mankind, but before he does that, he, even Jesus, has

306
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,380
 to be assessed.

307
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
 Why?

308
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:19,020
 Because true obedience can only exist when there is opportunity.

309
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,740
 If Jesus didn't get assessed, then he couldn't really prove that he was actually capable

310
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,940
 and qualified to redeem mankind.

311
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,580
 So he had to go through this process.

312
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,860
 He had to be tested.

313
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,380
 And this makes me think, actually, for us, if we are called, we must also be prepared

314
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,220
 to be tested.

315
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,460
 That there is testing in our lives.

316
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,460
 Of course, it's been pretty obvious this year, there is quite a lot of testing that's been

317
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:48,340
 going on, but we have to be prepared for that because it is good and it is right.

318
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,020
 Going back to the wilderness, if you go to Deuteronomy 8, I think I put this on the slide

319
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
 up there.

320
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
 I didn't have this on there.

321
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,780
 8, chapter 2, there it is.

322
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,940
 God is talking to the Israelites and they're in the wilderness.

323
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,240
 And the reason why is, verse 2, "And you shall remember the whole way that the Lord your

324
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,660
 God has led you these 40 years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know

325
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,900
 what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not."

326
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:25,100
 God allows us to have tests, to humble us, to test us, to see what is in our hearts.

327
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:32,020
 Have you been going through a test these last few months, or this last year, or these last

328
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,420
 two years?

329
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,820
 What has it revealed in your heart?

330
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,900
 I often say this last year has caused a lot of problems to surface in Hong Kong, right?

331
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,660
 But my actual thought is these problems were always there, right?

332
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,740
 And these incidents, these events have merely just brought them up to the surface.

333
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,780
 God allows for testing to happen.

334
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:57,900
 God allows for trials to happen, sometimes to humble us and test us, to reveal to us

335
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,860
 what is in our hearts.

336
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,460
 And then we can then cry to him in Psalm 139, "Search me, O God.

337
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,980
 Test my thoughts, know my heart.

338
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,340
 See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me on the path everlasting."

339
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,620
 The apostle James in James chapter 1 says this, "Count it all joy when you face trials."

340
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,140
 Because what do trials bring?

341
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,020
 It brings a level of steadfastness.

342
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,660
 And when steadfastness comes to its full effect, you will be perfect and lacking in nothing.

343
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
 Perfect and lacking in nothing.

344
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,020
 Brother, sister, if you are going through a test right now in your life, emotionally,

345
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:37,140
 professionally, what is it revealing in your heart?

346
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,020
 What is God trying to speak to you about?

347
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,140
 Count it all joy that this is happening.

348
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,340
 Even Jesus had to be assessed.

349
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,340
 And how did he fight this?

350
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,860
 Actually, what was the battleground that he was being tested on?

351
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,820
 This is even more interesting.

352
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,580
 End of chapter 3 is this, "Behold, this is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."

353
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,580
 Interestingly, the battleground is this.

354
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:07,020
 When the enemy comes to Jesus, the first question is, "If you are the Son of God."

355
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:12,220
 Wait a minute, we just had heaven opened, a voice come down and declare that he is the

356
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
 Son of God.

357
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,860
 So you see, the enemy is very interesting here.

358
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:21,420
 Even in the face of truth, what he's trying to do is sow seeds of doubt in our minds.

359
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:28,380
 If you are really the Son of God, if you are really Daddy's boy, and you're hungry, you

360
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:35,380
 could satisfy this fleshly desire, you could turn these stones into tassel vows.

361
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,740
 Like seriously, right now, you could do that.

362
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,980
 Because you have that power, because you're Daddy's boy, right?

363
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,700
 And you see, this is where it's interesting.

364
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:52,300
 It is about physical desires and needs, hunger, all these things, but it's really about identity.

365
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,420
 And it's saying, "If you are the Son of God, I know you just had heaven opened up and Morgan

366
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,460
 Freeman tell you that you are, but do you really believe that?"

367
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,820
 And this takes me back to the last sermon in Ephesians, the whole armour of God.

368
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,820
 What was it?

369
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:15,340
 The helmet of salvation, reminding ourselves, our minds, our brains, that we are saved,

370
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,620
 that we are children of God.

371
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,340
 And so Jesus then responds to him and says, "No, man shall not live by bread alone."

372
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,780
 And we're not going to go through each of those.

373
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,940
 And then he goes again, "If you are the Son of God, you could jump from this cliff."

374
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,060
 And what does the devil do?

375
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:33,860
 He quotes Psalm 91, which is what John just read to us.

376
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:40,420
 He says, "Hey, in the scriptures it says that you can command angels to come and catch you

377
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,060
 if you fall.

378
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:45,340
 Show me if you really are the Son of God."

379
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,380
 And then finally, he takes him up to the right to the top of the mountain and shows him the

380
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,620
 kingdoms of the world in all their glory.

381
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:57,140
 And he says, "Hey, I know you came down here with a mission, but you don't need to do all

382
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,580
 this stuff for the next few years and then have the cross.

383
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,980
 I can just give it you now.

384
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,420
 That's a lot of trouble, what you're going to be going through.

385
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
 I could just give it you now.

386
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,140
 All you have to do is bow before me, and then you don't need to do that.

387
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:15,420
 You can have this kingdom, and you won't even need the cross."

388
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
 Isn't that the temptation that we have?

389
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,900
 You know, popular culture turns something that maybe young people will be more aware

390
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,260
 of, this idea of friends with benefits, this non-committal life that we want to live for

391
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,420
 our own satisfaction and pleasure.

392
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,740
 Are we Christians with benefits?

393
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
 We want the kingdom of God.

394
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,300
 We want all the blessings to come our way, but we don't want to die to ourselves and

395
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,620
 to carry our own crosses.

396
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,060
 And that's the temptation that Jesus was faced with.

397
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,380
 And that's why the Bible tells us that Jesus is our high priest, that he sympathizes with

398
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:54,620
 our weaknesses because he was tested in every way that we are, for our physical desires,

399
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,700
 for power, for pride, for possessions.

400
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,460
 He was tested in every single way.

401
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,060
 And how did he respond?

402
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,900
 Going back to the Ephesians, the whole armor of God, we talked about the final piece of

403
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,980
 armor was the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God.

404
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:13,660
 And I asked the question, "When we're faced in battles, do we use our own weapons, our

405
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,260
 own experiences, and our own wisdom, or do we use God's weapons, the Word of God?"

406
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:30,540
 And we see Jesus here every single time using the Word of God, declaring truth against deceit.

407
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,420
 And he passes the test.

408
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,900
 He passes the test, the enemy leaves him, the angels come and minister to him, he's

409
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,860
 been announced, he's been approved, he's been assessed, he is nearly ready to take

410
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,460
 over the world.

411
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,060
 The final stage is then he assembles.

412
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:56,260
 Jesus' strategy to redeem the world was to pick a crew of fishermen and tax collectors.

413
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,060
 That's what he did.

414
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:04,260
 And we carry on and see this in chapter 4, verse 18.

415
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,660
 While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he sees two brothers, Andrew and Simon Peter.

416
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,980
 They're fishing, they're working hard.

417
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,580
 I've talked before how the Jewish culture is quite similar to the Chinese culture, working

418
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
 hard, staying in your family.

419
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,820
 And these guys weren't really poor, they weren't the poorest of the poor, they weren't the

420
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,820
 richest of the rich, but they were good people, hard-working people, working with their families.

421
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,020
 And Jesus walks up to them, and then as he's walking up to them, to the Sea of Galilee,

422
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,660
 he says these words that announce his invasion on enemy territory.

423
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:42,660
 He talks to individuals and he says, "Follow me, and I shall make you fishers of men."

424
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:48,860
 It's widely recognized that Jesus' first miracle was a wedding at Cana, where he's at a wedding

425
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,820
 and he's having some fun with his friends.

426
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,300
 And his mother comes and tells him off because there's no wine left and she knows that he

427
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,100
 can do something about it.

428
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,060
 And then he says, "Mom, it's not time yet."

429
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:04,260
 And then mom gives him the eyes and then she walks away and eventually he just does it

430
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,260
 anyway.

431
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,940
 And that is widely known as Jesus' first miracle, right?

432
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,660
 I think this could be counted as his first miracle.

433
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,620
 And I'll tell you why.

434
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,060
 If you're walking in the streets or if you're in your office, you're working, and then a

435
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,940
 strange-looking bearded Jewish man comes up to you and says, "Follow me, and I will make

436
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,020
 you a fisher of men.

437
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,060
 Leave your family, leave your work, leave your commitments, leave everything that you've

438
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,820
 ever known, and follow me."

439
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,500
 They immediately drop their nets and follow him.

440
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,100
 Isn't that a miracle?

441
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,900
 And it's not just Andrew and Simon Peter.

442
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,180
 Later, he keeps walking and he finds two other brothers, James and John, and they're working

443
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,180
 with their father.

444
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,180
 And what do they do?

445
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
 And he says the same thing.

446
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,660
 They immediately drop their nets and follow Jesus.

447
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:03,660
 Jesus' call to us is to follow him, no questions asked.

448
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,940
 You see, the more natural response, if someone comes up to you and says, "Follow me," is,

449
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
 "Who are you?"

450
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
 And then it's, "Why?

451
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
 Where are we going?"

452
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,340
 But they don't do that.

453
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,980
 They just follow him.

454
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,860
 And they leave their father, they leave their families, they leave their business to just

455
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,900
 follow him.

456
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:31,500
 Another interesting point is this, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."

457
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:36,660
 So he goes to them and he asks them to drop all that they have, but to not to let go of

458
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,980
 who they are.

459
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:42,220
 He goes to these fishermen and say, "I will make you fishers of men."

460
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,180
 You see, we don't have to deny who we are because we've been made by God.

461
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,780
 We've been fearfully and wonderfully made.

462
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,140
 We've been gifted in a very specific way.

463
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,260
 You have been gifted in a very specific way.

464
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:59,660
 You have been gifted experience, expertise, education in a very specific field, just like

465
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,940
 these fishermen were.

466
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:08,140
 And Jesus goes to them and he also goes to you and says, "I want you to glorify me in

467
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,220
 wherever I have placed you."

468
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,860
 He didn't tell them, "Follow me and I will help you shepherd a flock."

469
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,540
 No, he did that to Moses and David because they were shepherds.

470
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,740
 And then he did the fishers of men thing to the fishermen.

471
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,300
 And so the teachers, he will say, "I put you in a school.

472
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,420
 I put you in education for the next generation.

473
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,420
 Educate them.

474
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,420
 Spread the good news where you are."

475
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,220
 For the bankers, "Go and do that and don't steal money from people."

476
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:41,060
 And then he goes to doctors and says, "Be my hands and feet and go and heal people."

477
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:46,500
 Jesus is calling you wherever you are, whatever he has gifted you to be in, to give up everything

478
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:54,140
 you have, but to give him all you are, to live for him, to follow him.

479
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,500
 No questions asked.

480
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:02,300
 Immediately they drop their nets, their families, their possessions, their familiarities, everything,

481
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,040
 and they follow him.

482
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,580
 That is the King's rise.

483
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,440
 He's announced, he's approved, he's assessed, then he assembles a team.

484
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,820
 So what does that have to do with us?

485
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,620
 What does the King's rise have to do with you sat here right now in 2020 battling cabin

486
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,620
 fever and the coronavirus?

487
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:27,420
 I want to share just the final few thoughts really just for you to kind of meditate on

488
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,980
 because I think all of us are different.

489
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,980
 The first is this.

490
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,380
 Jesus needs to be announced.

491
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:43,220
 There are people in your life that he desires for you to announce his arrival to.

492
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:47,740
 There is someone that you are working with, living with, or hanging out with who doesn't

493
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,140
 know him yet.

494
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:54,500
 And not asking you to suddenly start wearing camel's hair and eat locusts and honey, but

495
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,540
 it's your job to announce Jesus to them.

496
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:03,700
 It's your job to tell them that in this season of bad news, of hopelessness, that there is

497
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,340
 good news coming.

498
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:11,580
 It's your job to be the narrator and say, "Hey, it's bad, but let me introduce you to

499
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,620
 someone."

500
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,900
 It's our job to prepare the way for Jesus to enter into their lives and then do exactly

501
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,820
 what John did and get out the way.

502
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,980
 But it's up to us to start by announcing first.

503
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,500
 Then Jesus was approved.

504
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:33,060
 And that message that God said about Jesus, if you've been baptized, if you've put your

505
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:39,620
 faith in him, if you live for him, that statement now applies to you.

506
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,140
 That the spirit of Jesus now lives inside you, that you now can call God Abba Father.

507
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,700
 You now are a child of God.

508
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,300
 You are a co-heir of Christ.

509
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,660
 You are an ambassador for heaven.

510
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,820
 You are loved.

511
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:57,020
 And with you, he is well pleased.

512
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
 You have a mission.

513
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:04,580
 It's not why you are loved, but you are loved and you have a mission and he is pleased with

514
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,060
 you and he approves of you.

515
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:11,700
 So go, make disciples of all nations.

516
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,580
 Go, tell the world about him.

517
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,100
 You are approved.

518
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,260
 Have that courage.

519
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:25,300
 And finally, he comes to you now and he asks you, drop whatever you have, whatever fears

520
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,100
 and anxieties you have and follow me.

521
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,380
 Don't ask any more questions.

522
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,980
 If you know who I am, if you trust in my name, if you trust what I did for you, then don't

523
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:44,540
 worry about these earthly things and just follow me.

524
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,340
 Why?

525
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,460
 You may ask.

526
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:55,260
 Because he is king and he is risen.

527
00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:00,180
 And if you believe that, if you believe that once upon a time, there was a man named Jesus

528
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,860
 who lived in heaven but then came to earth to redeem mankind.

529
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,900
 He went onto a cross and died but three days later, resurrected and then ascended to heaven

530
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,580
 and he one day will come back again.

531
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,500
 If you believe that story, if you believe those events, then you do not need to ask

532
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,460
 any more questions.

533
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,460
 Follow him.

534
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:27,460
 Can I pray?

535
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:42,180
 Father, I thank you that you, God Almighty, creator of all, deemed us worthy to even know

536
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,900
 who you are.

537
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:51,620
 It is your spirit that revealed yourself to us.

538
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,260
 And in light of the fact that you are king, we bow before you.

539
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,100
 And we pray that not only are you king of the universe but that you would be the king

540
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,100
 of our lives.

541
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,020
 That you would be the king of every decision that we make.

542
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:15,220
 Lord, that in everything that we do, you are part of it.

543
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:22,940
 And just like Jesus, who faced trials and temptations, we stick close to your word.

544
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,740
 We hide your word in our hearts just like it says in Psalms so that we might not sin

545
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,660
 against you.

546
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,420
 We meditate on your word day and night.

547
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,020
 But Lord, help us on the days where we find that hard.

548
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:43,980
 Thank you for initiatives like one where we're able to gain access to your word in a fresh

549
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
 way.

550
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,260
 But I pray now for every brother and sister here as they engage in battle, as they are

551
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:53,140
 assessed, as they face life's challenges.

552
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,940
 Lord may they be able to distill your still small voice in the midst of all these other

553
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,580
 distractions.

554
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:11,220
 May we all be gifted with the opportunity to be still, to know that you are God.

555
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,420
 So Jesus, our king, we are flawed.

556
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:21,460
 We're not able to do it every day, but right now we choose to follow you.

557
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,380
 And we pray all these things in your name.

558
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,020
 Amen.

559
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:35,020
