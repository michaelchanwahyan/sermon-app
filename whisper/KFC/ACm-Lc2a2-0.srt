1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
 Thank you, John. There's going to be much more to come regarding that, and most of all

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,200
 just honouring John and Sandra. Now is not necessarily the day to do it because they're

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:25,480
 still going to be together for a little while yet. You know, John just said he thought he'd

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,640
 be here doing this for two to three years and then he'd be gone. And I was like, you

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,440
 know, I've been in Hong Kong for four years and I thought I'd be here in Hong Kong for

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,800
 two to three years. But the truth is there will be change. And I was praying to the Lord

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,880
 about this. I was like, Lord, is this something that you want Christina and I to do? Because

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,000
 we don't really need to do this. But if it's you, we will do it. And if it's not you, then

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,400
 we definitely won't. And then as I was praying, I really felt the Lord just going, well, James,

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,600
 if you take this group of people, people whom you love, and it's a group of, I don't know,

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:16,200
 60, 70, how would you feel if you grew that group to 30 people? Or 300 people? Or 10 people?

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,400
 Would it matter to you? And I had to get down on my knees and say, Lord, I don't know. I

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,720
 don't know. In fact, I don't know what I'm doing. John's been in ministry as long as

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,600
 I've been alive. Literally, that's true. You came to Hong Kong in '86, right? '87? I was

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:45,640
 born in '86. And so there are so many things that I don't know. And I keep saying this,

16
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,840
 James, people keep asking me as I'm leading young life, people keep asking, James, what

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,440
 are you going to do about this? What are we going to do here? And I was like, you know

18
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,840
 what? I have, quite frankly, I hope this doesn't worry you, but quite frankly, I do not know

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,400
 what I'm doing. But at the very same time, I know exactly what I'm doing. Because I want

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,760
 to keep to the simplest, purest form of what church is. And may the Lord have mercy on

21
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,680
 us as we go about that. It isn't about building church. It isn't about getting to a church

22
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,000
 of a different size. Another pastor friend asked me that exact same thing. Would you

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,040
 be happy if you took a church of 100 and you grew it to 30 people, but those 30 people

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,800
 loved the Lord? And then when you walked into the room, you felt life and you felt the Holy

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,280
 Spirit just moving in there. Would you be happy with that? Or would you want just a

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,600
 bigger and bigger and bigger group? And my answer is, all I want is not to build the

27
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,000
 church. That's not what Jesus asked us to do. Jesus asked us to make disciples. And

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,640
 so my prayer is that we would be able to do that. Whatever number the Lord gives us. And

29
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,760
 that might change in the form of, well, how do we get the young families in? English speaking

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,960
 families, their kids usually sleep a little bit earlier, not like the Hong Kong ones.

31
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,040
 Actually I was in Central Landmark last night for a dinner because my wife and kids are

32
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,960
 not around. So I'm going out and partying till 10 and I'm like, I'm so tired, I'm done

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,320
 guys. And then I'm walking to the MTR and I'm seeing these Hong Kong kids and these

34
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:21,240
 babies just wandering around. English speaking families don't do that. English speaking families,

35
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:27,560
 we eat at six, bedtime stories at seven and you're in bed by eight. Which means, if we're

36
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:34,600
 going to do an English speaking church and we want to serve from the womb to the tomb,

37
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,840
 we have to change some things. We don't know what they are right now and I'm not here to

38
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,160
 announce anything. But I want you to pray for us, pray with us. And if you receive anything

39
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,200
 from the Lord, ask and tell us. But I would say that in these next few months, that's

40
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,920
 what we're doing as a leadership team. We're going to get on our knees and we're going

41
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,840
 to seek the Lord, we're going to ask the Lord. We're not here to build a church, we're not

42
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,040
 here to build a church. You said you will build your church, we just need to make disciples.

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,280
 And you show us what you want us to do. Because the only thing that I really want is for a

44
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:12,320
 group of people, a gathering of people who are so devoted to the heart of Jesus. Devoted

45
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,680
 to what He cares about, what He wants us to be and that is all and nothing else. And we've

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,360
 just started a series and this is a nice little segue into what the series that you've been

47
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,360
 doing is, which is looking at the heart of Christ. And Pastor Johnny last week talked

48
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,720
 about a heart that touches. And it's my pleasure as we carry on that service to really talk

49
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,640
 a little bit more about that. A different side of Jesus. Because if we're to be a church,

50
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,920
 we're not just here to attend a service. That's definitely what I don't want. But how can

51
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,520
 we be a church, a people, a body that pursue His heart? Would you pray with me as we open

52
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,520
 up the word?

53
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:59,640
 Lord, we thank you. And once again, we thank you. We thank you for John, we thank you for

54
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,200
 Mary, thank you for their faithfulness, for their wisdom, for their leadership, but most

55
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,240
 importantly for their heart, for their love for you and for their love for people. But

56
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,720
 as we take this next step together into this new season, there is only one thing we ask.

57
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,040
 There's only one thing that we'll seek after. That we would dwell in your house all the

58
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,240
 days of our lives. We will gaze upon your beauty and inquire in your temple and we'll

59
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,320
 pursue your heart. And as we open up the word now, would you speak to us? Would your Holy

60
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,480
 Spirit move our hearts towards you? As we find out more about your heart, would you

61
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,280
 make our hearts more like yours? In Jesus' name, amen.

62
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,280
 Hey, so I haven't been here for a while. I realize I haven't done this. I've come back

63
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:51,280
 and Pastor Johnny's shaved his head and he's bald now. John's had short hair. I'm like,

64
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,600
 "George, you and I have started a revolution." I didn't realize I was such an inspiration

65
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,080
 to that many people. Well done, Johnny. It's pretty cold. It's pretty nice and breezy in

66
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:11,720
 the summer though, isn't it? Don't hide it. Be bold and courageous. Yes. Yes. Welcome

67
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,640
 to the club. You know what? I prefer that look to the kind of that long, greasy, dirty,

68
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,200
 homeless look you had. Yeah, you remember that one? The greasy, homeless look. That

69
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:32,840
 was not so cool. Oh, man. Welcome, Johnny, to the club. Never leave. Never leave. I can't.

70
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,040
 Oh, dear. Jesus had this heart to touch people and to

71
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,640
 really move, to go to those in need. When he announced himself to ministry in Luke 4,

72
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,880
 he opens up a scroll and he reads in the synagogue, Luke 4, and he reads from Isaiah and he says,

73
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,280
 "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me to reach a certain type of people." What kind of people?

74
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:00,720
 The blind, the oppressed, the captive, the broken. He's looking for those in need and

75
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,280
 he's saying, "I'm going to come and help you. I'm going to come beside you. You need

76
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,280
 saving. I'm going to come and be with you." That's his heart. His heart is to touch people,

77
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,520
 to look for people who desperately need some good news.

78
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,160
 Today, we're going to talk about a different kind of people that he's also looking for.

79
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,400
 He's talking to a woman at the well in John 4, a woman from Samaria, and he's confronting

80
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,280
 her. He's saying, "Hey, actually, you've not been too good with your relationships.

81
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,080
 You've had five husbands and now the one that you're with, you're not even married yet.

82
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,360
 It's not looking good for you." And then she realizes that and she talks to him about something

83
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,000
 else. She's like, "You're right. I've been looking for something. I've been looking for

84
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,240
 a relationship. I've been looking for a connection. I've not had it. Do you know why you Jews

85
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,680
 say that we can only worship there, but we can't go there and us Samaritans can only

86
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,640
 worship here? Tell me what that is about. Why can't we worship with you all?" And then

87
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,160
 Jesus says, "You're right. There's a time that is coming where people aren't going to

88
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,840
 be worshipping in this place or in that place because God is spirit and people will worship

89
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:08,440
 him in spirit and in truth. And the Father is seeking those kinds of people. He's looking

90
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:15,080
 for people who would worship him. 2 Chronicles 16, 9 says, "The eyes of the Lord are just

91
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:21,160
 scouring through and to and fro the earth, looking for people whose hearts are blameless

92
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,240
 towards him." God is looking for these kinds of people. In Luke 7, which is the passage

93
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,520
 that we're going to look at today, he finds someone like that. If you look at... Don't

94
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,360
 envy Eunice who's at the back in the slides right now because I'm going to be flying around.

95
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,920
 I told her about this and she's going to try and keep up. Anson's just laughing because

96
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,160
 she knows how hard this is going to be for her. But good luck. Eunice, I'm going to throw

97
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:54,120
 you a bone to start with the first one. Luke 7, verse 9. There we go. You get to stay in

98
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:01,080
 church. Everyone gets to stay. He says, well, let's do the whole 9. "When Jesus heard these

99
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,800
 things he marveled at him and he turned into the crowd that followed him and said, 'I tell

100
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,560
 you, not even in Israel have I found such faith. The Father is seeking for people who

101
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,920
 will worship him in spirit and in truth, but not even in Israel have I found a person like

102
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,320
 this who had this kind of faith.'" What is this kind of faith that we're talking about?

103
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,800
 What is faith? When I talk to you about faith, what do you think it is? Do you think about

104
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,440
 George Michael and the song that he sings, "Faith"? What is it to you? Of course, in

105
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,840
 Scripture we see, Hebrews chapter 11, the famous chapter on faith. Faith is what? Faith

106
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,320
 is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things unseen. So when you have

107
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,300
 faith in something, you're like, you know what? I can't see it, but I believe in it

108
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:56,880
 and I put my trust in it. And 2 Corinthians 5, 7 says, "I walk by faith and not by sight."

109
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,440
 So I'm living in a way where I can't see what's happening in the future, but it doesn't

110
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,560
 matter. I'm going to take the next step because God is going to be with me. God's got my back

111
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,640
 and I'm going to keep taking this step and I'm going to keep walking by faith. Ephesians

112
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,880
 2 said it's by this faith that we're saved. Romans 8 talks about this hope, which is often

113
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,840
 interchanged with faith, is this hope that you can't see. You don't hope in things that

114
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,000
 you can see. It's like, I don't look at Paul. I always talk about Paul in my sermons. I

115
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,080
 don't hope, "Oh, I really hope that Paul's going to come today. He's right here, so I

116
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,640
 know that he's here." So that doesn't require faith and hope. Well, he's at least embodied,

117
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,240
 but maybe not in mind, but he's right here. But if I have faith, I'm thinking, "He's not

118
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,800
 here yet, but I know, I know Paul will come to church and I know Paul will come on time

119
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,120
 because he's a punctual man." Until he got married and then things really went downhill.

120
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:57,600
 But I have faith in things that I cannot see. The question then becomes, he says, "I can't

121
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,000
 even find this kind of faith in Israel, but I'm looking at this other guy, this Roman

122
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,640
 officer, and he has that faith." And then it made me think, "Hey, if God came to Hong

123
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,520
 Kong, what kind of faith would he find?" If he said he can't even find this kind of faith

124
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,360
 in Israel, so he's looking for this kind of faith, if he came to Hong Kong, would he find

125
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,040
 this kind of faith? That's the question that I had. And then it got me thinking, actually,

126
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:26,640
 what kind of things do Hong Kong people put their faith in? Have a think. I mean, preaching

127
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,880
 to the choir here, you guys are at church, so I'm hoping, I'm guessing, you profess to

128
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,040
 have put your faith in Jesus. But if you look at Hong Kong, take a step back. The city that

129
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:44,720
 God's place is in. What do people put their faith in? Real estate. Yes, absolutely. Property.

130
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,000
 Just a box, just a shelter, and then it's all good. To stop you from the rain that suddenly

131
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,640
 keeps coming every now and again. The church too. Of course, I look around and I see education.

132
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,400
 We put our faith in education, right? The mission organisation I'm with is Young Life,

133
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,680
 and all the kids, they've been forced to put their faith in education. Even parents who

134
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,120
 are Christians will force their kids to do well at school. I mean, of course, it's good

135
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,000
 to do well at school. I'm not trashing school here, but we put our faith in education. How

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,800
 do we know that? Because before a child is born, a pregnant lady will go and try and

137
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:28,440
 register their baby into education. And when they come out, at one month old, they're trying

138
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,520
 to read the books to them, to teach them alphabets. And when they're two years old, they're trying

139
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,320
 to teach them how to interview. Right? I mean, if you took my children to go for an interview

140
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,040
 at two years old, you'd get nothing. You'd get nothing. But parents are trying to do

141
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,760
 that. This is not even a joke. Why? Because we put our faith in education. Why do we put

142
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,200
 our faith in education? It's because if you get your kids to go to a... If you get your

143
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,280
 kids to go to Bremer Hill, if you get your kids to go to DBS and to St Paul's co-ed,

144
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,280
 or the other schools, or CIS and HKS, ah, now we're talking. Because when we get the

145
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:08,080
 kids to these schools, we know, we have faith, they'll get a good education. And what does

146
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,760
 a good education mean? It means they get to go to a good university, an Ivy League university,

147
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,440
 a university in America, or a better university in the United Kingdom. And so you go... So

148
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,000
 you put this through... Yeah, the really smart ones will go to the UK, right, Vincent?

149
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 (audience laughing)

150
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 - I didn't know you had universities.

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,160
 - Oh, people like you. We don't usually tell people like you. So then we put our faith

152
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,920
 in education. But you finally now, you're an adult, you're working. What do you put

153
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,560
 your faith in? You put your faith in work. You put everything in work. Your job. You

154
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,600
 need your job. Well, in Hong Kong, rent is so expensive, you need your job. So you put

155
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,240
 your faith in that. I'll tell you what. What do you put your faith in? I'll tell you what

156
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,760
 you put your faith in. When things don't go your way, and you start getting worried and

157
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,440
 anxious, that'll highlight to you what you actually put your faith in. When you're trying

158
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,520
 to get that job, or when you're worried that you're gonna lose that job. I've got a dear

159
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,200
 friend who's a partner at one of the big four, he's worried he's gonna lose his job. I was

160
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,520
 like, "Ah, that's what you put your faith in. Because you think your job's gonna be

161
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,800
 the thing that keeps you safe." Or it's when your relationship... "Oh, maybe if I get that

162
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,280
 spouse, if I get that girlfriend, if I get that boyfriend, I need to keep this friendship,

163
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,880
 I need to keep this relationship, I need to keep this connection, because this connection,

164
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,680
 Hong Kong is all about connection, kwan hai, and you get that, oh, now I'm gonna put my

165
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,440
 faith in these people." But when those people start not... They don't reply to you, they're

166
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,800
 ghosting you, or they don't like you, or you have an argument, oh, it makes you feel horrible,

167
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,880
 because you put your faith in them. Real estate, we have the education to get the job, to get

168
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:55,000
 the money, so we can buy a tiny, tiny, small box to live in, and now we are safe. And what's

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,920
 next? We don't know what's next. We just stay in this box. We put our faith in these things.

170
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:08,140
 And what about the church? What about missions organisations like Young Life? They put their

171
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:15,200
 faith in just people, staff, paid staff, pastors, to come and preach the word, to come and shepherd

172
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,200
 the flock, to make you guys all strong. But we're gonna do all the work, then we'll run

173
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,840
 programmes for you, and then we'll do outreach things for you, and then we'll do all these

174
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,560
 things, and then we'll sing songs so you can worship God, because the rest of the week,

175
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,360
 you've completely ignored Him. But now, we're gonna be able to sing four songs, and you'll

176
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,760
 be able to worship God with all you have in these next 15 minutes. We put our faith in

177
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:42,600
 these systems, so we can help each other. But then we put our faith in buildings. We

178
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,060
 put our faith in all these things. Is that the kind of faith that God is looking for?

179
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,760
 Is it the kind of faith that God is looking for? We put our faith in earthly things, in

180
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:59,040
 earthly status, in earthly merits, in earthly institutions. Jesus finds a different kind

181
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,040
 of faith. And I wanna unpack this a little bit. It doesn't specify and say, "Hey, this

182
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,400
 is what faith is." This is what faith is. It means that when you're about to lose your

183
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,400
 job, you're not worried, because you know God is in control. Christina and I had this

184
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,640
 when we were still working in England, and I was a teacher, and she was working in the

185
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,440
 hospital. And we felt the Lord was calling us to quit our jobs, to go into ministry.

186
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,640
 We'd just had Reuben, and we were like, "But where are we gonna, how are we gonna pay the

187
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,520
 bills? How are we gonna do anything?" And then it came to that moment, and I've told

188
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:35,160
 some of you this before. It came to that moment where I suddenly realized, "Is God calling

189
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,600
 us to do this?" "I believe so." "Yes." "Then will He provide for us?" "Absolutely, yes."

190
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,680
 "Do I believe Him? If I don't, I might as well stop the whole Christianity thing altogether."

191
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,680
 Does that make sense? Because if we say that we're Christians, but then we say, "Oh God,

192
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,960
 we trust you, we love you, we worship you, we're good." But then we completely don't

193
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,080
 trust Him, and we fret about every job that we have, we fret about every relationship

194
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,040
 that we have, we fret about every investment and every property we have, then do we really

195
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,880
 trust Him? Do we really have faith? I don't think we do. Jesus finds a man who has faith.

196
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,920
 It's not the man that you would have thought. It's not a Pharisee, it's not a Sadducee,

197
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:14,400
 not well-respected people in the synagogue, it's not pastors. He comes in and He finds

198
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,920
 a guy who shouldn't have this kind of faith, but he does, and He marvels at it. He's saying,

199
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:24,080
 "I have not even seen this faith in Israel. What is that kind of faith?" Now, He finds

200
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,080
 it in a guy called a Centurion. Centurion is a Roman officer and looks over about 100

201
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,040
 people or so, but some of them actually got so high that they'd look after 400 or 500

202
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,520
 people. So this is a guy who's been placed in a town called Capernaum. Now, this is not

203
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,200
 Jerusalem, this is not Manhattan. This is just a side fishing town where he gets to

204
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,960
 chill out and live a good life, really. There's nothing really that's going to be that crazy

205
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,960
 that happens there. And Jesus, after preaching His Sermon on the Mount, so you see this?

206
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,960
 We've got in Luke 6, we've got the Sermon on the Mount here. The other version, of course,

207
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:03,120
 is Matthew 5-7. And He preaches, and after He preaches all this incredible sermon, He

208
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,840
 then starts putting things to action. And He goes to Capernaum, and then He enters there,

209
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,780
 and now a Centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death who was highly

210
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,080
 valued by Him. So He meets this Roman officer who is in this fishing village, and He finds

211
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,580
 the kind of faith that He doesn't even find in the people that He first reaches. As we

212
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,120
 look at this faith today, I want us to see what kind of faith the Centurion actually

213
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,560
 had, and is there anything that we can apply to our own lives, our own walk with the Lord.

214
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,560
 That's what we're trying to do. Is that good? Are you with me? So, the first kind of point

215
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,880
 that I want to make here is this. The Centurion's faith was not in earthly status. It was not.

216
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,880
 It was not in earthly status. Why? You see here, verse 2, Eunice, verse 2. Now, a Centurion

217
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,720
 had a servant who was sick and at the point of death, and here's the key word, who was

218
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,800
 highly valued by Him. This was a slave. This was a Roman officer who was in charge of a

219
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,600
 hundred people, a man with authority, and he had a servant that was sick, nearly dying,

220
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:11,560
 and this Centurion deeply cared about this slave. What does that tell me? He has a kind

221
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:19,160
 of faith that does not rely on earthly status. Does he need to care for this slave? No, and

222
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:25,280
 yet he does. And you may think, "Oh, well, okay, well, that's not too surprising. We

223
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,240
 should care for the people around us." We should, but do we? Thankfully, we don't have

224
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:37,080
 slaves anymore, but we can see. I said Jesus comes to help those who are in need, those

225
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,160
 who are vulnerable. What about the ones here in Hong Kong? Actually, forget do we highly

226
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:48,240
 value people in society who are of a lower status to us? Do we even see them? Do we see

227
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,680
 those old ladies pushing the cardboard boxes in the streets? Do we see the domestic helpers

228
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,160
 who are following families and children, who are raising the next generation of Hong Kong?

229
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,800
 Who's raising them? They are. Do we even see them? There's someone who says, "Actually,

230
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,400
 a measure of a person's character is how they treat people who are vulnerable and can't

231
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,800
 fight back." But so often, we have a very different perspective. We put our faith in

232
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:19,040
 who we are and where we are in society. "Oh, I'm actually just here." And we have a tendency

233
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,760
 where the people that are below us, we don't even see. We see them as an inconvenience.

234
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,960
 When I'm walking in the street, in tight streets like Wan Chai, and I see that old lady pushing

235
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,320
 that car with all the cardboard boxes, I'm like, "Oh, how do I dodge you? How do I walk

236
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,840
 past?" One time I was sitting there waiting for a friend for a coffee, and I saw this

237
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,320
 lady and she sat down and she was just tired. I was like, "Oh, I want to get to know her."

238
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:48,680
 So I budged up to her and she kind of freaked out a little bit. I was like, "Hi." I just

239
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,920
 wanted to get to know her. I wanted to hear her story. I was like, "Oh, have you been

240
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,120
 doing this for a long time?" She's like, "I've been doing it for about five, six years."

241
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,280
 Of course, do I want to do this? No. I have to do it five, six years? Oh, okay. I was

242
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,560
 like, "How come?" Well, me and my husband were in business together, but then my husband

243
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,440
 passed away. So I have nothing else to do. I was like, "Do you have children?" "Yeah,

244
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,280
 I've got two kids, but they don't look after me. They're on the other side of Hong Kong.

245
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,920
 I barely see them." I'm talking to her and I'm like, "There's a story there. There's

246
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:28,560
 a life there." Yet so often I ignore people who don't matter to me. In fact, not even

247
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,200
 ignore, I don't even see them. I managed to train my consciousness to completely avoid

248
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,400
 the people that don't help me in any way. Yet here we have a centurion who doesn't need

249
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,840
 to do this, yet highly values his slave, his servant. He does not put confidence in earthly

250
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,800
 status at all. What stops us? What stops us from seeing people who, what we perceive are

251
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:57,920
 beneath us? Because we put our faith in ourselves. We have to just keep everything to ourselves.

252
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:04,240
 We need to get people who can help us. It's called the poverty mindset that we have. It's

253
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,320
 the scarcity mindset that we have. I need to look after myself first before I can do

254
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,800
 anything else because I need to make sure that I am okay. I was so embarrassed last

255
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,160
 week. This month it was my birthday. I had some really generous good friends. They gave

256
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,560
 us a voucher to go to the Mandarin Oriental. I was like, "Oh, that's so good. That's

257
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,120
 so nice." We were going to stay in a hotel there, but then hotel prices have completely

258
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,600
 spiked since everything is normal. We couldn't afford to go to the hotel room anymore because

259
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,800
 we have to pay a lot more. We went to the buffet in the Clipper Lounge. Has anyone been

260
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:42,040
 to the Clipper Lounge? I come from England where when we go for buffets, Chinese buffets,

261
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,520
 the English people, the white people don't really know what to eat. They go to the food

262
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,200
 and they grab all the pizzas and the beer and the fries and they just fill themselves

263
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,480
 with carbs. I'm like, "What are you doing? The teppanyaki and the sashimi is right next

264
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,320
 to you." But they don't do that. But in Hong Kong it's different. We went to Macau recently

265
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,640
 and it's a fight. It's a dog fight. The moment the lobsters come out, everyone's

266
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,560
 just clamoring towards the lobsters. Chinese people know what food. George is looking at

267
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,320
 me just saying, "You're just judging me." I'm sorry, George.

268
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,280
 I don't mind shellfish.

269
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,040
 Oh, okay. I had that experience from Macau where I was like, "Man." Then I'm at

270
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,120
 the Clipper Lounge for the buffet for the very first time and likely the very last time.

271
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,440
 It opens at six and they're like, "Okay, you can go and get your food." I see just

272
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,440
 all the crab and all the lobster and all the sashimi. I'm like, "Oh my gosh." I'm

273
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:41,000
 the first one in the line. I was like, "Ruben, three dishes, three plates. Let's go."

274
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,440
 We just grab it all, grab it all. I'm like, "Christina, don't worry. I'm going to

275
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,920
 grab as many for the whole family for the rest of the year. We're going to do this."

276
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,800
 I grab it. I take it back. I'm like, "Ruben, you stay here. You wait here. I want to put

277
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,680
 these back and then I'm going to come and get some more plates." Then we just have

278
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:00,120
 a whole table of crab and lobsters. I'm like, "Thankfully, we managed to get it." Can

279
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:06,360
 you imagine if I wasn't in the front of the line? It would be a disaster. We eat the

280
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,920
 first round and we're completely stuffed. Then I'll go back and it's all full again

281
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:16,040
 because it's the Mandarin Oriental. It's not some cheap buffet. The waiter just keeps

282
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:26,280
 refilling it constantly. I was so embarrassed because I felt like I needed to do this because

283
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,760
 otherwise if I miss this, this will be gone. Those other stupid Chinese people will take

284
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:38,000
 all the food. I'm going to take it all first. I sat down. I was like, "I'm so embarrassed

285
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 because the lobsters and the sashimi are all replenished back to full 10 minutes later."

286
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:49,240
 In fact, I realised it will never lack. It will just be there. We have a scarcity mindset.

287
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,000
 I had a scarcity mindset in that moment. Why? Because I put my faith in what I need to do

288
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,280
 myself. I put my faith in what I need to accomplish.

289
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,680
 There's another thing about this centurion that's interesting. He doesn't only just

290
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,400
 look after people who he doesn't really need to look after. He looks after people who are

291
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,360
 across political lines too. You see in verse 5, he says this. Actually, no. What actually

292
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,720
 happens is he hears about Jesus. He has a servant that needs to be healed. He sends

293
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,800
 his Jewish friends who are some of the leaders of the Jewish community. He sends them to

294
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:23,280
 Jesus and says, "Hey, can you tell this Jesus guy to come and help my slave?" This is what

295
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,560
 happens. The Jewish guys actually go to Jesus and say, "Hey," verse 4 to 5. He says,

296
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,200
 we'll start with verse 4. "When they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly

297
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,800
 saying, 'He is worthy to have you do this for him, for he loves our nation and he is

298
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,240
 the one who built us our synagogue.'" Are you kidding me? This Roman officer sends

299
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,880
 these Jewish guys to go and intercede for him to Jesus and then these Jewish guys are

300
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,400
 like, "Hey, this guy, he's a good guy. He loves us. He loves our people." To the point

301
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,840
 where he's generous and he built our synagogue. This Roman officer in charge of a hundred

302
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:05,400
 soldiers controlling and oppressing this Jewish people loves the Jewish people.

303
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,000
 To the point where he's like, "I'll give you the money and the resources to help you build

304
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,880
 the synagogue because I believe that you're onto something bigger than what I can see."

305
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:24,640
 He does not put his faith in earthly status. He does not put his faith in his own power.

306
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,160
 He's still occupying the Jews and yet he helps them. That's number one. He doesn't put his

307
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,880
 faith in that. Number two, he doesn't put his faith in earthly merit, in what he can

308
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,960
 do. It's fascinating. Verse four, the Jews are like, "He is worthy. Hey, he deserves

309
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,280
 this. He's a good guy. He helped us build our synagogue. Hey, I'll tell you Jesus, you're

310
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,040
 coming into our town. There's going to be a nice shiny synagogue. If it wasn't for this

311
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,560
 guy, there would be no synagogue. He deserves it. He's done a lot of stuff for us. Now you

312
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,800
 do some stuff for him." Verse six, what does he say? He sends these Jewish guys to talk

313
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,000
 to Jesus first and then afterwards, "For he loves our nation and he is the one who built

314
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,680
 us our synagogue." Verse six, "And Jesus went with them." So Jesus is like, "Okay, you say

315
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,000
 he deserves it. You say he's worthy. He's like, "I'll follow you." "And Jesus went with

316
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,840
 them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends saying to him,

317
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,960
 'Lord, do not trouble yourself for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.'"

318
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,920
 So his friends say he is worthy and he changes his mind and says, "I am not worthy. Actually,

319
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,960
 stop. I know you're on your way now. I'm freaking out. I've changed my mind. Actually, I do

320
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:32,040
 not deserve for you to be under my house, under my roof." He does not put his faith

321
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,920
 in earthly merit at all. He doesn't care what other people think about him. Other people

322
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,080
 are saying, "Hey, dude, you are worthy. You are good. You've done so much for us. Let

323
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,000
 us help you out with your slave. It's a little bit weird that you care for that guy, but

324
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,120
 it's okay. We're going to help you out here because you deserve our attention." He's like,

325
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:57,240
 "You know what? I don't. I do not. I am not worthy. You are worthy. I am not worthy."

326
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:04,120
 He doesn't put his faith in himself. He does not put his faith in his own CV. Isn't that

327
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:11,240
 interesting? Where so much of what we do here in this city is stacking our own CVs, putting

328
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:21,200
 our faith in ourselves, making sure that we can do it. Here's the point. We can't. I was

329
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,080
 talking to a friend yesterday who is in the real estate, and his family is one of the

330
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,840
 ones who builds all these buildings. He's like, "You know what? I just don't know if

331
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:36,140
 I can do it. I just don't know if I'm ... I feel like an imposter. I'm not worthy of this

332
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:41,000
 kind of stuff." I was like, "You are exactly right. You're not worthy at all." He's like,

333
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,960
 "But Pastor James." I'm like, "That's the point because you think you are supposed to

334
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,320
 be worthy. You think you're supposed to work your way to get into the good books, but you

335
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,320
 will never get into the good books by your own way." Isn't that what we think? Isn't

336
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,300
 that what we put our faith in, our own earthly merit? Imagine Jesus walks through the door

337
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,280
 right here. It's a reckoning because we know he's Jesus. We know he's here and he's going

338
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:12,320
 to be ticking off these names and going, "Okay, who's good? Who's worthy?" That moment, just

339
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:20,880
 have a think now. Are you unworthy or are you worthy? Why? I'm like, "Oh, well, if Jesus

340
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,800
 is coming in right now, well, first of all, I'm glad that I'm here rather than not in

341
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:30,360
 church. I was tempted not to come today because of the rain, but thankfully I'm here. Oh,

342
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,800
 I guess I've ... Yeah, my attendance has been pretty good, a solid 75% in church. Sometimes

343
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,320
 I do welcome. Sometimes I'm an ambassador. Sometimes I stay awake in service. Sometimes

344
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:48,560
 I lead worship team. I'm pretty good." How many of us would be standing or sitting if

345
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:53,480
 Jesus walks through the door? I don't know about you, but I would be face flat on the

346
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,040
 floor because the glory of the Lord is something else. The Bible says the glory of the Lord,

347
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,960
 the holiness of God. This is to a point where if we actually saw him, we could die. That's

348
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,240
 what he said to Moses. It's that intense. There's no way that we could sit here and

349
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:15,400
 just go, "Yeah, I'm a pretty good person." That doesn't happen. The apostle Paul says

350
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,080
 this in Romans 3. He says, "There's no distinction. There's no difference between George and I,

351
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,080
 even though our hairstyles are the same. There's no difference between good people and bad

352
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,160
 people. You're all bad. We all fall short of the glory of God." The centurion got that

353
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:35,960
 because he had every right to think, "Hey, I've got Jesus coming into my house. Come,

354
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,760
 Jesus. I'm a kind man. I want you to help my slave. Come, pour you some tea. We'll have

355
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,880
 a nice meal because I am worthy." No, he's like, "Don't come anywhere near me because

356
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,840
 I am not worthy." He doesn't put his faith in his earthly merits in the things that he

357
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:02,080
 does himself. That's the nature of the gospel. The moment we start thinking, "Oh, we can

358
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,560
 work there. We can get to a place where we deserve it. We can get to a place where we

359
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:12,840
 are worthy." That's when we've missed the point. That's the kind of faith that Jesus

360
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
 marvelled at.

361
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:21,800
 Finally, so, he doesn't put his faith in earthly status or connections. He doesn't put his

362
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:27,480
 faith in earthly merit. He also doesn't put his faith in earthly authority. It's interesting

363
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:36,320
 here what happens. He goes to Jesus. We'll do verse six again. "Lord, do not trouble

364
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,680
 yourself for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. So stop. Don't come anymore.

365
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:47,960
 Therefore I did not presume to come to you. But say the word and let my servant be healed."

366
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,640
 Say the word. I don't need you to come anywhere near me because I'm not worthy. I'm just not

367
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,320
 ready for you. But you say the word and let my servant be healed. "For I too am a man

368
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,360
 set under authority with soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes. And to

369
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:07,000
 another, 'Come,' and he comes. And to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."

370
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,320
 He doesn't put his faith in earthly authority, but he knows that Jesus has a different kind

371
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:18,400
 of authority. Notice he doesn't say, "I too am a man with authority." He's not saying,

372
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:26,160
 "Jesus, I know you're a big boss in your world. I get it. I am too. Game, recognize game.

373
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,040
 But I know that you can do stuff that I can't quite do. But I'm going to need your help

374
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:36,000
 a little bit now. And just can you just say the word?" It's not that. He doesn't say,

375
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,800
 "I too am a man with all the authority that you have." He says, "I too am under authority."

376
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,760
 What does he mean? He means actually as a centurion, he's in charge of this town. He's

377
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,800
 in charge of these guys, but he also is under authority ultimately to Rome. The only reason

378
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:59,720
 he has this power and authority here is why? Because of Rome. Do you get that? So this

379
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,680
 is the reason why these people obey him. "I too am a man under authority. And so when

380
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,240
 I say to these, 'Do something,' they don't do it just because I'm who I am, not just

381
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,880
 because I'm a nice guy, but because they know the power and authority behind me." And he's

382
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,200
 saying to Jesus, "Hey, I get that. I get that because people listen to me because of

383
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:30,520
 my relationship with him. And I know you have authority. I know that you only need to say

384
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:36,080
 the word because you have a relationship with someone else that is beyond this world. I've

385
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,520
 heard it. I know about it. And because of that, I know that you don't even need to come.

386
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,040
 I would quite like to meet you, but I'm not ready for you yet. But say the word and help

387
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,680
 my servant." He doesn't put his faith in earthy authority at all. He realizes that Jesus has

388
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,360
 something else. In John 12, Jesus says this. Oh, I didn't put it down. Sorry. Don't worry,

389
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:09,320
 this isn't there. But I do need to read it because I haven't. John 12, 44. Jesus cries

390
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,040
 out and said, "Whoever believes in me, believes not in me, but in him who sent me. And whoever

391
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,080
 sees me, sees him who sent me." He says, "Hey, if you believe in me, it's because you believe

392
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:25,440
 the Father in heaven who sent me to come and save you." So when we trust in Jesus, it's

393
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,240
 like actually because we know who sent him, where he comes from, it's an authority that

394
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:36,120
 isn't of this world. The centurion got that. And yet so often we put our faith in the people

395
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:42,360
 around us, in the things that we do, in our CV, and in the authorities that we have here

396
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:50,000
 on this world. The centurion puts his faith in a completely different authority. I ask

397
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,960
 you again as I finish, where do you put your faith? It's an honest question, it's a simple

398
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,480
 question that requires a really simple and honest answer. Do you put your faith in yourself?

399
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,200
 Do you put your faith in your works? Do you put your faith in your church? Do you put

400
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,720
 your faith in the government? Do you put your faith in the economy? What do you put your

401
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,240
 trust and faith in? It's really interesting, when you're growing up, when you're young,

402
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,880
 you kind of just, you can take on everything. You live as though you're never going to die,

403
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,960
 because you can do everything. And then as you get older, and I've shared this before,

404
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,040
 it's, you know, the times that I've been in hospital where things have been completely

405
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,040
 out of my control, things when I lose loved ones, that you have no power to help them

406
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,440
 at all, it's in those moments, it's in those moments of fragility that you truly feel your

407
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,880
 humanity, where you're like, man, I put my faith in the wrong thing. In fact, this thing

408
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,560
 is never going to last, this body is never going to last, this hair is never going to

409
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:05,640
 stay. I put my faith in the wrong thing. It's when things don't go the way that we want

410
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,560
 to, that exposes what we truly put our faith in. And so this guy I'm talking to, who's

411
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,440
 in the one of the big four, he's like, oh, I don't know, I might lose this job, but I've

412
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,440
 got this other job that I might be able to get. I was like, it really doesn't matter

413
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,320
 which job it is, whether it's this one, whether it's that one, whether it's no job. Where

414
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:32,000
 do you put your faith? Because I tell you this, if God isn't real, then yeah, you need

415
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,040
 to work your butt off, you need to do everything you can, you need to scrounge the people,

416
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,680
 you need to clean whichever shoes you need to clean, because whichever part you need

417
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,920
 to clean to get the jobs that you need, because you can only trust in yourself, you can only

418
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,560
 trust in your relationships, you can only trust in that if God is not real. But, but,

419
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,160
 if God is real, then there's a high authority that you can trust in. Then you don't need

420
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,440
 to worry. When you have your interview, you've done your best, you don't have to worry, oh,

421
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,280
 am I going to get this job or not, am I going to be able to get this? You don't have to

422
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,200
 worry, because God is real. Does that make sense? It sounds so simple, I know. If God

423
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,560
 isn't real, then yes, worry and do all these things and put your faith in these things,

424
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,120
 but if God is real, it changes everything. It changes the way you deal with everything,

425
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,620
 even sickness, even losing loved ones, everything. Because why? Because you know that he is in

426
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:32,120
 complete control. Do we have that kind of faith? That's the faith that we need to have,

427
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,640
 that's the faith that saves. Why? Why are we able to have that kind of faith? Because

428
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:45,440
 Jesus, because Jesus didn't care about his status. And he came and laid his life down

429
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,160
 for us. In Philippians 2, we see this. Paul lays down the template for how we're to live

430
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,640
 in harmony. He says, "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or conceit." Each of you look not

431
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,600
 only to your own interests, but to the interests of others. Don't put your faith in your own

432
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,760
 things and how you're going to get things. Look after other people. You are free to look

433
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,440
 after other people. James, you are free to go to the clipper lounge and hand out all

434
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:15,380
 the crabs and the lobsters to all the other tables first. Do that first, because my banquet

435
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:25,280
 is never-ending. Don't put your faith in yourself and how many plates you can carry to the table.

436
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,760
 If God is real, if God is real, we don't need to do that. And I think most of us are here

437
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,720
 because we know that God is real. But our actions tell us otherwise. Our thoughts tell

438
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,680
 us otherwise. Because as soon as we leave here, we're worrying about our job. We're

439
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,000
 worrying about our friendships. We're worrying about the relationships. Because we've kind

440
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,240
 of just lost, we've forgotten that if God is real, that he provides, that he is good,

441
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:53,600
 that we don't need to worry about these things. Because Jesus, he didn't account his status

442
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,680
 anything. He didn't count equality with God, a thing to be grasped. But he emptied himself,

443
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:03,120
 taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of man and being found in human

444
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:08,360
 form. He humbled himself to the point of death, even death on the cross. He came and defeated

445
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:13,160
 death. And after that, he then resurrected. And what does he say after he gets resurrected

446
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:19,560
 in Matthew 28? It is all authority into heaven on earth has been given to me. Death has no

447
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:26,800
 hold on me and it won't have a hold on you. That is the unlimited banquet that we're invited

448
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:36,600
 to. Imagine how we would be if we didn't have that fear of scarcity, of poverty. Imagine

449
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:43,120
 how we would be, how you would live if you had that kind of faith, where even if you

450
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:53,000
 lose your job, even if you lose your loved one, you're okay. Because you know the one

451
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,360
 who has the complete authority now. And that person was willing to lay down his life so

452
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,560
 that you wouldn't have to trust in your works because you can now trust in his work, what

453
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:09,080
 he did on the cross. You still do your best with your works. You work as though you're

454
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:16,120
 working for him. But you don't have to put your faith in it because of what he did on

455
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,680
 the cross. And now he has the authority, he has the status. Therefore, God has highly

456
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,040
 exalted him to be the name above every name. So that every knee will bow and every tongue

457
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:35,520
 will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. He has that authority and he can say the word.

458
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,320
 Can we? Can we pray that the Lord would give us that kind of faith? So it doesn't matter

459
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,280
 whatever is happening outside, in the city, in the world, the stabbings that are happening,

460
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,920
 the bombings that are happening, or in our own lives, when our walls are falling apart,

461
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,840
 when we are genuinely worried about our job and how we're going to pay rent. Can we have

462
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:06,680
 that kind of faith where we're just saying, "Jesus, I trust in you." What's one situation,

463
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,160
 this is where I'll finish. What's one situation where you can surrender that to the Lord?

464
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,280
 What's the one situation where you are putting your faith in earthly merit? Where you are

465
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,560
 putting your faith in another person? Where you are putting your faith in another authority?

466
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,720
 What's one thing that you can just let go of and just say, "God, it's not anything to

467
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:30,000
 do with our worthiness, we don't deserve any of this, but because of you, I can trust you,

468
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:38,420
 so just say the word." It's interesting because when God says the word, it happens immediately.

469
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:44,720
 We are surrounded by people who just talk with no action. But when God does it, when

470
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:52,240
 he says, "Let there be light," and it happens immediately. God says the word and it will

471
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,600
 show you the power that he has, a power that is nothing, that we can't find anything like

472
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:01,880
 it in this world. Let's put our faith in that. Let's put our faith in Jesus. Can I pray for

473
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:24,780
 you? Lord, we spend a moment now and we come before you. Maybe we say those famous words,

474
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:30,820
 "Lord, we believe. Help our unbelief. Lord, we do want to trust in you. We do believe

475
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:46,340
 in you. We do think we have faith in you, but help our unbelief. We don't want to just

476
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,740
 believe in you. We don't want just to believe that you exist, but we want to believe you.

477
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:57,260
 We want to take you at your word and believe that you will do what you say you will do

478
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:06,580
 and that you are who you say you are." So Holy Spirit, can you just show us in this

479
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:14,520
 moment if there is anything that is in us that isn't of you? Anything else in this world

480
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:34,120
 that we put our faith in? Forgive us, Lord, for putting our faith in that thing or that

481
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:47,720
 person or that job. Some trust in chariots, some in horses, others in jobs, others in

482
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:56,720
 connections, but as for us, we will trust in the name of the Lord. Amen.

483
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:06,720
