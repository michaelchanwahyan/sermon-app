[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   - Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.960]   I'm really glad that we can just worship together online.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.080]   And I even get my own chair for the very first time.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.520]   And while just letting you know that I won't be able to see your faces, so if you're falling
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.840]   asleep, I won't know at all.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.880]   But I'm imagining that you're sitting at the edge of your seat.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.040]   So let's hope that imagination is the reality.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.640]   But I just wanted to say that it's just great to be able to worship together.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.940]   And for the last two weeks, we have been looking at the sermon series, which is on health for
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.960]   all and all for God.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.840]   And we had two excellent sermons by Pastor James and Pastor John.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.800]   And if you've missed it, please go back to it.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.600]   And we're just gonna continue this week on Break the Power of the Past.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.020]   Now before we actually dig into any sermons, I do wanna tell a short story.
[00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.440]   So there was someone and he went to a party.
[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.920]   You know how parties are, there's lots of food.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.360]   And so he goes to the kitchen and he sees this hostess.
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.640]   And the hostess begins to prepare this meat.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.640]   Do we have this meat up?
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.220]   Oh, yeah, we do have this meat up.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.360]   And so he begins to cut the sides, just cut the two sides flat.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.020]   And he puts it in this oven that's huge.
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.280]   And so this guest has no idea why is the hostess doing that?
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.080]   I mean, the meat is barely enough for everybody and she's already cutting it off.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.960]   And so she goes and asks the hostess, why is it that you're cutting off the sides?
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.840]   And so to his surprise, the hostess says, well, I don't really know, but my mom has
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.800]   been doing it all along.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.560]   Now, interesting enough, her mom was also at the party.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.000]   So he goes over to her and asks, Auntie, so what is it that makes you wanna cut off the
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.560]   sides 'cause obviously the oven's quite big?
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.560]   And interestingly enough, she answers the same way, well, I don't really know, but that's
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920]   what my mother has always done.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.240]   And so an opportunity arise and the whole family and this guest got to go to the hostess
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.400]   grandma's place, which is actually at a cottage.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.360]   And so they were there and this guest remembers this interesting scene.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.060]   So he goes and asks grandma, why is it that you cut off the size of this meat?
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.180]   And she's like, oh, well, it's very simple, come in my kitchen.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.320]   So they all went to the kitchen and lo and behold, they found that the oven was very
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   small.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.080]   And so grandma says, well, my oven's too small and I could never fit the entire piece of
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.760]   meat in, so I always had to chop it off.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.400]   And so, I mean, that's actually a perfect illustration of what we mean when we say the
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.960]   power of the past.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.560]   And sometimes we don't even know why we do certain things.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.440]   And it's okay if things are perfect or if they're rosy, right?
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.640]   But what if the things that we're going through has negative impacts in our lives?
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.800]   Then really we need to look into the past and make sure that in Christ, we get to break
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.200]   that bondage or that chain.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.680]   And so today, this is exactly what we're going to talk about.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.920]   And so when we talk about what paths are we actually trying to break?
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.880]   Now there are great, wonderful traditions, blessings, and even inheritance that we would
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.740]   receive from our parents and also from previous generations.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.200]   So if you're a kind, loving person because your father and mother are that way and that
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.760]   you have learned it through experience to be such a person, well, we don't want you
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.360]   to break that.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.600]   Or if your parents have a condo or two, you know, it's pretty expensive in Hong Kong,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   right?
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.800]   That they want to give you as an inheritance, well, we don't want you to break that either.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.240]   So today we're just going to focus on the past in terms of the sins that have been more
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:13.980]   or less passed on or the strongholds, which includes beliefs and values that do not align
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.160]   with the Bible.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.000]   And the third thing is ungodly characters that we have somehow developed or have got
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.620]   that passed me on.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.460]   So just want to say that we're going to focus on the negatives.
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.960]   So I'm not saying that the great things are not in our minds, but this won't be the focus
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.960]   for today.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.600]   But so how are these things formed?
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.640]   And you know, with the earlier illustration, we kind of see that first is from the family
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:49.220]   of origin and second are from events and also past experiences that we have.
[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:55.400]   And actually from the author of Emotionally Healthy Church, we actually realized that
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.840]   in order to be healthy churches, people actually need to understand how their past have affected
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.280]   their present ability to love Christ and others.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.400]   And it's important that they've realized that from scripture and life, that an intricate,
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.320]   complex relationship exists between the kind of person they are today and their past.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:24.720]   And numerous external forces may shape us, but the family we have grown in is the primary,
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:31.480]   I mean, except in rare circumstances, the most powerful system that will shape and influence
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.060]   who we are.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.880]   So if you have brothers or sisters, or if you have young children at home, or if you're
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.640]   going to be future parents, and also for yourself, you want to make sure that we're all getting
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.040]   this together.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.280]   So now let us look at a character from the Bible, from the book of Genesis, which is
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.400]   Abraham.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.120]   Now Abraham is a great man of faith, but at the same time, he also has some character
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.040]   flaws and sins.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:06.920]   And if we look at Genesis chapter 12, we're going to see that God at the very beginning,
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.320]   he promises him an inheritance.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.120]   He says, "I will make you into a great nation.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.600]   I will bless you.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.000]   I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing."
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.360]   And other nations will also be blessed by him.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.480]   However, in the same chapter, when we get to a famine where they had to go to Egypt
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.880]   for food, we already see that he tells the first lie that we're going to see, which is
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.200]   when the Egyptians were there, he told his wife, Sarai, at that point, which later would
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.240]   be called Sarah, that they are going to kill me for your sake.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:49.680]   So just say to them that you are my sister, and they will treat me well, and my life would
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.240]   be spared.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.960]   And so Sarah was taken to Pharaoh's palace, while Abraham strategizes, and it worked,
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:07.200]   because he then received a lot of cows and goats, and also these servants, in which became
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.840]   his wealth.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.200]   And so as we read on, of course, Pharaoh finds out, because God was protecting him.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.080]   And after confronting him, Pharaoh let them go.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.560]   So we thought, okay, maybe it was just a one-time thing.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.840]   But does anybody remember if he did it again?
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.000]   Okay, I suspect that you're nodding your head behind the screen there.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.640]   Yes, so he did it again.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.920]   And in Genesis chapter 20, the same thing happened.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.560]   There was another famine.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.960]   Instead of going to Egypt, they went to King Abimelech.
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:47.720]   And in that moment, he also told the other people, and also his wife, tell them that
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.080]   you're my sister.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.840]   And he told everyone, she is my sister.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:58.480]   And again, Sarah must be beautiful, because again, the king took her into the palace,
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.240]   and God had to intervene before the king would confront Abraham again.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.200]   So what we see is, even though we have a song that sings, "Father Abraham," okay, I'm not
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.360]   going to go down that route, that we only talk about the great things, but he also has
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   these sins and these character traits that aren't so pretty.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:25.200]   And when we look at it, he really was quite selfish.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.120]   He was putting his wife's life on the line.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.280]   She could be raped, and there could be other things that happened to her for his own benefit.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.800]   And at the same time, he was cheating, and he was deceiving.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.680]   And we thought that it might just end there.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.120]   But does it end there?
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.400]   No, I know you're shaking your head back there.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.280]   No, what happens?
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   So he has a son.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.160]   Well, he has two sons, Ishmael from the Egyptian slave, and then he also has Isaac.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.360]   And does Isaac do the same thing?
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.920]   Yes, he does.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.000]   And where is that?
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:07.680]   Well, in Genesis chapter 26, we see that in the same way that there was a famine, that
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.800]   they again went to the same king, Abimelech.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:15.880]   I don't know, this king must be nuts, driven by the same family and being tricked twice,
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:22.600]   that he said the same thing, that Rebecca, which is his wife, he claims to be his sister,
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.480]   because he was afraid that his life would be taken.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:31.240]   So what we see is that one kind of sin, lying and cheating and deceiving and having this
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.800]   selfishness about just thinking about himself, continues on in this family.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.300]   And you know, it doesn't stop there either.
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:42.600]   So it continues to go on.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.560]   David has two sons and they're twins, Esau and Jacob.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:52.080]   And we see that in his old age when he wanted to bless them, but his eyesight was actually
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   failing him at that point.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.040]   And what we find is that Jacob again, deceives his father.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.560]   And this deceiving, this cheating continues on.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   And for those who have read Genesis know the story quite well, where he wanted the first
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:18.920]   born blessing so badly that his mother schemed it where they would pretend to be Esau to
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.420]   receive that blessing.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.000]   And so it continues.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.360]   Does it stop there?
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.440]   No, I know you're tired now.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.280]   You're probably not shaking your head.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.880]   I'll shake it for you.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.520]   And so no, right?
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.840]   The next one that we find is that Jacob has 12 sons.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.520]   And of course his favorite one was Joseph.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:43.000]   And so his brother then schemed, deceived, cheated and decided that we're going to murder
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   him.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.640]   But nah, because if we murder him, we're not going to get any benefit.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.520]   Remember this family is all about benefits, right?
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.520]   So what do they do?
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.400]   Well, let's sell him because at least we can get something.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:11:00.360]   So it runs in the family again, not only deceiving, not only being selfish, now sibling rivalries
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.600]   we see and also for money.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:10.320]   So all of these we see are sins that even in this family, and we know how blessed Abraham
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.760]   and his descendants are, have it.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.800]   I mean, in the same way, you and I are also in this kind of position.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.000]   I mean, we might have family, we might come from families that are divorced or single
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.400]   parent and that has a negative effect on us, our security, our feeling of being confident
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.760]   or there may be other things.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:38.000]   For example, maybe there's a sickness that runs in the family or a continual habitual
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.480]   addiction that your family might be struggling with and you eventually find yourself kind
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.440]   of in the same position.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:53.520]   So today we really want to just break all of those things, break from the past.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:59.440]   And so when we read on in Exodus 20, this is where we see the Lord telling us where
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.680]   does this all kind of generational curses seem to be coming from.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:11.400]   And so in verse one to five, it literally says that, and God spoke all these words.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:17.480]   This is where they were on Mount Sinai and Moses was receiving the 10 commandments from
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.480]   the Lord.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:22.560]   And he says, "I am the Lord, your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.700]   of slavery.
[00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.960]   You shall have no other gods before me.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.940]   You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything."
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:36.160]   In verse five, "You shall not bow down to them or worship them for I, the Lord, your
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:42.420]   God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of their parents to the third
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:49.160]   and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.080]   of those who love me and keep my commandments."
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.360]   And when we read this at first, we see, wow, God's great.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:02.880]   He loves us so much that he's going to show love to us over a thousand generation.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:07.400]   But there seems to be a line that we're a little bit disturbed where it says that God's
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:14.000]   going to punish the children for the sins of their parents to the third and fourth generation.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.600]   And sometimes we think in our mind, well, that's unfair.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.400]   Well, I didn't do anything wrong.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.120]   Why am I being punished for something that someone did?
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:26.680]   Well, if we look closely at the word punish in Hebrew, it actually means kind of like
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:35.320]   visiting, or in the ESV version is like visiting the inequity of the fathers on the children.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   Well, really what this means is that God's not actively punishing us for something that
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   our forefathers did.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:51.880]   But he's saying that the consequences of what sins or sinful nature, the things that they've
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:57.160]   done in the past continues to be naturally manifested into our lives.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:02.880]   I mean, one simple one would be how Adam and Eve had ate the forbidden food where they
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.640]   were not supposed to eat from the tree of good and evil, but they did.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:17.280]   As much as God loves us, there's a consequence of sin, which is death, and it continues on,
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.520]   and that's why we also need to die.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:26.680]   So we see that it's not a punishing way, but it's the consequence of what happens.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:34.640]   And so I want to share as well that actually in my life, I have definitely found there
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:44.840]   are so many paths that were entangling me in terms of my emotional and physical well-being,
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.120]   and one of that was actually suicidal thoughts.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.340]   And the truth be told is that about 10 years ago, and I think at some point I've shared
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:58.340]   with some of you that I had suicidal thoughts.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:03.740]   And I did mention that I don't think I would have ever taken any action just because the
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.720]   thought of that is quite scary itself.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:16.120]   However, that thought actually made me seem demotivated, and I will wake up every day
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:22.760]   not having the meaning to go on, not wanting to go on, and always praying the prayer, "God,
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.520]   please take me home.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.800]   Take me because I can't do this."
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:34.360]   And it was a hopeless and also helpless state of mind.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:41.280]   And when I looked back, I realized that not only haunted me, but actually it also haunted
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.600]   my family.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.480]   One of it being the first was my aunt.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:53.520]   Actually I've never met her, but I heard that after she gave birth to three children and
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.840]   having a really tough time in her life, she committed suicide.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:05.200]   She jumped off the building, and I mean, it's in the family.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:13.800]   And so when my grandma found out, she got really depressed as well, and she wasn't able
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.880]   to eat much.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:23.500]   And actually quite soon after my aunt's death, she passed away.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:30.640]   And actually just three years ago, actually, my uncle also committed suicide.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:37.040]   He actually walked out into the ocean, and he actually don't know how to swim.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:43.720]   And so eventually he was found, and I don't want to go to too much details, but what I
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:53.340]   do want to say is that there is a strong power that continues to hinder us.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:59.340]   And if we don't look into it, it can easily actually come into our lives.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:06.580]   And when I had the chance to sit with counselors and also read books and listen to sermons,
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:13.060]   I realized that, I mean, what was really causing these suicidal thoughts or even actions?
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:18.540]   I realized, at least for me, I can't speak for them, is that one thing, it was caused
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:25.940]   by low self-esteem and the idea that I can't really make any changes, nothing I do.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.460]   I mean, for one thing, nothing I do is good enough, and the other thing is I can't really
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.900]   do anything to change what's happening.
[00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:39.300]   And I realized, I mean, these things are actually more common than I know.
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.180]   I mean, many people also suffer from this.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:47.780]   And so when I think even in a deeper sense, I mean, where did all these things come from?
[00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:54.620]   And when I go deeper into it, I realize, well, it's actually the belittling that I have experienced,
[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:59.780]   and I realized that when I was younger, when I made mistakes, I would be often told that,
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.140]   "Oh, you're stupid, and you can't even do anything right."
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:12.100]   And so these voices from actually my parents would continue to repeat in my mind as well.
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:18.900]   And so I would have very low self-esteem, and my family's not big on praising or affirmation,
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:24.100]   and may easily compare me with other people as well.
[00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.980]   And because the other thing that really caused it, I think, is the idea, I mean, is the fact
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:34.260]   that my dad also passed away when I was really young, even though I've prayed hard for him
[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.780]   not to be.
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:45.500]   And so I think this all like hopelessness and the hopeness, continued to be in my life,
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:50.900]   and I realized if I had never looked into it, it would affect me.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:56.340]   Now, when I say all these things, I don't want to say like, "Parents are bad," and I
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:01.300]   don't want to say, "My parents are bad," because I love them, and they're so good to me.
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:06.660]   But what I do want to say is we are imperfect people, and there are things that we don't
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.460]   know are sinful that we continue to do.
[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:18.380]   And so really it is my prayer and also my hope that all of us, because of our brokenness,
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:24.740]   somewhere along the line, there is something that is still hindering us.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:32.600]   And today I'm sharing that, I guess, quite out loudly, because I feel like someone is
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.220]   also suffering from these things or other similar things, and I don't want us to overlook
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.220]   that.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:48.060]   And so, I mean, after all this, I suppose the question really is, I mean, how, or how
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:56.820]   do we overcome these pasts that we've just talked about, we've established where they
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.660]   possibly might be coming from?
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:05.980]   And the Bible actually tells us in John 3, 7 that we are to be born again.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.460]   Of course, born again has different meanings in the context.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.240]   I mean, one of those is that we need to be radically new.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.260]   We need to be make anew into a different person.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:23.900]   One that is not only from our generational past, but one that's absolutely new from the
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.580]   Word of God.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:33.860]   And so we become this new creation stated also in 2 Corinthians 5, 17, that the old
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.020]   is gone and we're this new creation.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.380]   And so how do we actually achieve that?
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:44.540]   Well, the first thing that I want to share with you is to identify and connect.
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:46.900]   I mean, looking for that pattern.
[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.420]   I mean, what has been happening in your life?
[00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:54.300]   Have you continued to see patterns of failure in the same area?
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:59.140]   Or have you noticed that you've been depressed over the same things?
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.300]   What are they?
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.820]   And not only do you look within your life for that pattern, what about generational
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.820]   patterns?
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.600]   Do you see anything that's happening?
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.060]   Maybe you had parents that were single parent and you're at the verge of thinking about
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:21.900]   divorce or maybe you had people that continue to belittle you and you find that you're belittling
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.460]   other people around you.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.900]   I mean, what is it?
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.980]   Is there a pattern that you're seeing?
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.940]   So first identify it.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.340]   And we can do that by drawing out a genogram.
[00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.260]   In a moment we'll show you kind of what that looks like, but we won't actually go through
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.260]   it.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.340]   But to give you a sense of what it is.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.940]   Or we can talk to someone.
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.580]   Talk to someone that really knows you.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.580]   Because you know what?
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:53.340]   Your blind spot and my blind spot isn't so minimal to other people.
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:55.740]   It's very obvious to other people.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:22:01.660]   And they can definitely tell us where it is that we are repeating those patterns.
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.100]   And also we can connect to the past.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.420]   What that means is we need to find out where the root of the problem is.
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:16.180]   I mean, even if I know that, oh, I'm suffering from low self-image or I'm suffering from
[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.140]   a certain kind of addiction, but where is it coming from?
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.740]   That's also very important.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:28.420]   So for us to connect the dots and then we can have a chance for Christ to help us, to
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:30.100]   liberate us.
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.300]   And the third thing really is to accept it.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:38.300]   Because you know, many a times after finding out what it is, even connecting to the root,
[00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.820]   there might be a part of us that wants to reject it and say, "No, you know what?
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.060]   I am not a narcissist.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.460]   What are you talking about?
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:48.180]   I'm not selfish."
[00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:52.680]   And so sometimes we might just don't want to accept it.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.140]   And so the very first part for us is to do that.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.260]   And so we're going to show you what a genogram looks like.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:03.420]   And there are lots more information where you can go online, Google it, and see how
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:08.820]   you can do it, maybe with a few friends or with your clans in your small group.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.040]   And you can definitely find out to see those patterns.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.980]   And so the next one I want to show you is how do we identify them?
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:21.740]   So I have a list here of things that you can identify for yourself and also for your family
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.940]   together, maybe you can do it with your family.
[00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:26.820]   I mean, has there been lying going on, cheating?
[00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:32.220]   I mean, every now and then I found that, you know, I might be, I'm not cheating, cheating,
[00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:34.700]   but there was one time I didn't bring my app.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.140]   And so I can't do the leave home safe.
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.820]   And I wanted to go in from the back door, that kind of thing.
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:45.820]   So are there any suicidal thoughts or divorce or jealousy?
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:50.100]   I mean, do you see yourself comparing to someone all the time?
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.300]   And do you have low self-esteem?
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.900]   Are you arrogant or anxious all the time?
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.900]   Are you depressed?
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.220]   Do you have bipolar?
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.140]   Are you obsessed with certain things?
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:07.140]   I mean, sometimes it can be things that are a lot lighter, like being impatient is also
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:14.260]   a characteristic that isn't so great, or lazy, narcissists, being selfish, or it might be
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:19.740]   that you're very, you know, you can give up very easily when hardship comes.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:24.540]   Or you find yourself blaming other people instead of taking responsibility.
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.660]   Or there might be a sickness that's being passed on.
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.260]   And there's something that you can do about it.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:36.540]   Or not being content, or have addictions, or belittling, being abusive, comparing, or
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.540]   irresponsible.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:43.260]   Now, this definitely isn't a full list, but it's a good list to start.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.780]   And I also came up with a list that, you know, we can start to connect the dots.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:49.340]   I mean, where did it come from?
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.500]   I mean, did we have overprotective families?
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.820]   Did we have a family where there were verbal or physical abuse?
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:02.060]   Or maybe you were never complimented by your parents.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:07.540]   Maybe you were always compared to, or had divorced parents, or substance addiction,
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.020]   or there's some sort of love for money.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:16.220]   And it could be because it came from a time when your family went through poverty.
[00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:21.220]   And it can be a role model of just seeing who they are, and you've kind of copied that
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:22.220]   yourself.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.540]   And there's belittling, or there's loss of loved ones.
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:31.860]   And that's really scarring you and making you insecure or scared to love again.
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.380]   Or have you been bullied, rather, at school, at home?
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.380]   Are there sickness?
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:40.420]   Or maybe you were raised up by a helper instead of your parents.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.260]   And maybe you didn't have much discipline.
[00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.340]   Or maybe the other way, you had too much discipline.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.900]   And their family habits or traumatic experiences.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.220]   Or you might even have a disabled sibling.
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:26:01.860]   And that can cause all sorts of emotional unhealthy states.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.660]   So I mean, again, this is a list, really, for us to start.
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.900]   Because I don't want this sermon-- I want this sermon to be a really practical one,
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:15.340]   where after we hear about it, we really begin to think what those things are.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.500]   And the second thing that I really want to say is that we need to own it.
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.980]   Because it's easy for us to kind of shift blame and just say, well, you know, I'm like
[00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.100]   this because my parents were saying, well, my grandma was like that, my grandpa.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.140]   And so the situation's like this.
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:36.780]   And whenever we blame or shift the responsibility, you know what that is?
[00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:40.180]   It means that we don't need to do anything about it.
[00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:44.580]   And the only time that we'll do something about it is if we own it and say, you know
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.580]   what?
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.580]   This has happened.
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.220]   My parents didn't know, neither did my parents' parents.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.420]   And you know what?
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.020]   It's going to stop here right now at my generation.
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.280]   And I'm determined to do that.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:03.020]   And if we have this kind of determination, and we can go to God and say, God, help us.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:09.180]   I see this passing on, this sin or this ungodly character, this stronghold.
[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.900]   And I want it to stop now.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.900]   And that's where it's going to work.
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.060]   Because we are taking ownership.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.460]   We're doing something about it.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.160]   We're going to God with it.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.500]   And the last one is that we need to relearn.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:29.340]   Now there's a Cantonese phrase, not phrase, word that I really like, which is "ticking,
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.340]   ticking."
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.060]   Okay, you're borrowing the mirror.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.100]   I don't know how to translate this.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:40.620]   So really, it's like we're learning from what other people did that didn't work.
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:45.180]   So if you're seeing your parents were doing this or your grandma, and that didn't work
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.420]   out well, well, you know what?
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.060]   Let's borrow the mirror, which means let's learn from them.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:55.220]   We don't have to walk into a ditch before we know it's dark and cold, right?
[00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.220]   We can just see it.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.440]   Oh, that's not, that's dark and cold.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.040]   Let me do something else.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:08.100]   And so the idea is to learn, relearn something that we find that is crucial.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.580]   And the next thing is, we have talked about this before, which is don't do it alone.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:18.140]   You know, we have plans here where it's a safe place for you to really do this together,
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.300]   to find out what it is and to support one another.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:26.340]   And I'm so thankful that I got to speak with the people at the Wellbeing Champions that
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.980]   were hosted by Christina and Charlotte last year.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.460]   And a whole bunch of us went through the training.
[00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:38.280]   And they've volunteered, many of them saying that they would be glad that they would be
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.940]   our first touch points.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:42.380]   But this is something that's on your heart.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.020]   You want to talk about it first with us.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:50.340]   And again, I mean, we're not trained professionals, but we're trained to listen.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:53.020]   We're trained to point you in the right direction.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.580]   So if that's you, please don't hesitate.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:29:02.460]   And I want to say you can call us, but there's an email here, kfci@kongfeng.org.
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:06.620]   And we really just want to be your first point of touch point.
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.620]   Yeah.
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.580]   And also let your community reparent you.
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.580]   What does that mean?
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:18.420]   Reparenting means maybe you had some really harsh parents and they've never complimented
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.420]   you.
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.420]   But you know what?
[00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:25.420]   Let your community be that group of people where they can compliment you.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.420]   They can cheer you on.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:32.420]   They can praise you for the little things or the big achievements that you've done in
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.980]   your life.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:43.100]   And also maybe you had parents that were abusive or other parents that didn't know how to support
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.940]   you and listen to you.
[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:50.700]   Well, this community, we will learn together how that works.
[00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.620]   I mean, we can learn to listen to you and you can learn to listen to other people as
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.620]   well.
[00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.900]   So as a community, we can reparent each other.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:04.660]   Whatever it is that we didn't know and we didn't get a chance to experience, we can
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.060]   do that.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:14.540]   And so you see, I really just want to kind of wrap up with Genesis 50.
[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:24.940]   This is actually after all the lying and cheating and deceiving and Joseph, which is the second
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.700]   youngest son of Jacob.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.740]   He was sold into slavery and yet he became the second in command.
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:38.620]   And he was the one that helped a lot of people because he was the one that stored the grain
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.060]   during the famine where everybody could be fed.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.340]   And so this is what he said at the end in the hindsight.
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.940]   He said, "You intended to harm me."
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:53.660]   And when he said you, he meant the brothers intended to harm me.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:31:01.100]   But God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many
[00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.100]   lives.
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:10.260]   And so I just wanted to kind of end with that note where God can take whatever your family
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:18.220]   origin sins or passed down sins or ungodly character or strongholds and he can redeem
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.220]   it.
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:26.100]   And when he redeems it, it's not only for you, but for the blessings of other people.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:36.260]   And I believe that personally, I had also had that privilege to be reparent by God himself.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:44.540]   And in Christ, he has the power to break every chain and every sin or strongholds that we
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.540]   have.
[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.260]   It's not just our generational, rather it's our experiences of pain or loss.
[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.540]   And he is able to do that.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:59.020]   And I want to say now that when I make a mistake, instead of feeling like I'm stupid and I can't
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.140]   do anything right, I'll be like, "Okay, that's a mistake.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:03.500]   What can I learn from it?
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.900]   I'll do a better job next time."
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:09.260]   And I have the confidence that God's going to be with me.
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.080]   He's going to help me to make those changes.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:17.380]   And instead of being scared that anything that I do is not going to have an effect in
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:22.220]   the future, it won't change, I don't have that thought anymore.
[00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:31.340]   I know that if I go to God with my situation, he will always help me in a way that is God-glorifying.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:37.900]   And I believe that he has redeemed me and that from this generation, from my generation,
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:44.020]   that there will be at least cut from my family any suicidal thoughts.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:51.540]   And so I really see God being that redeemer and he is here not only for me and many other
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:55.120]   people, but he is here for you.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:03.200]   So let us just really soak in how God's redeeming power can really break every chain and that
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:07.400]   he is here to break the power of the past for you.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.520]   So let us pray together.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:16.560]   Dear Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you for your redemptive power, that it was
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:24.720]   because of what was done on the cross, that we are redeemed people, that no matter what
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:33.880]   Satan, what evil spirits have desires for us to devour us, to kill and destroy and to
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:40.080]   steal, that his plans will never prevail because you are here in our lives.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:45.640]   And we pray, Father, that you continue to help us to break every single chain, break
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:54.600]   every single sin that has been long going in our generations before us to stop because
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   of you.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.280]   And Father, we thank you for your redemptive power and your loving grace for us.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.280]   In Jesus Christ's name we pray.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:03.780]   Amen.
[00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:13.780]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
