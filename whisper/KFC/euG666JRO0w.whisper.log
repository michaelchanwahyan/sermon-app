[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   It's so good to see you human beings!
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.160]   Isn't it good to be together again?
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.360]   Actually, you know what, who are we kidding?
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.360]   We've had people on the MTR for a good few weeks now.
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.760]   Has it surprised you when you suddenly see all these people on the MTR again?
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.840]   It's kind of like moving to Hong Kong all over again.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.200]   And I was like, "Whoa, social distancing, bro!"
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.000]   But it's really good. It's really good to be here to see everyone.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.840]   I pray that you've all been well.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.640]   Last week, Pastor John started us on a new series called "Dear Church."
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.440]   "Dear Church," looking at the book of Revelation.
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.960]   And today I get the honour of going through the first letter
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.160]   that Jesus writes to the first church He wants to talk about.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.440]   The book of Revelation really is the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.840]   You see, I can't do it. OK.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.960]   Let's just move this aside.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.240]   The revelation of Jesus Christ to the Apostle John.
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.240]   To us.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.040]   You know, the whole book, the whole Bible is basically pointing towards what?
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.760]   Pointing towards Jesus.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.560]   Jesus is central to God's rescue plan for us.
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.840]   And we see here now in Revelation, is Jesus revealing Himself.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.240]   And it looks nothing like we expected.
[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.560]   Jesus looks nothing like we expected or had prepared ourselves for.
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.160]   In fact, we sang a little about it.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.440]   That He will return.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.640]   And it looks very different.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.840]   And if you look at Revelation 1, you'll see a very, very different Jesus
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.360]   to the lovey-dovey, teddy bear Jesus that accepts us and forgives us.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.360]   And so we now start in Revelation 2, and He writes to a church in Ephesus.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.040]   Ephesus is an interesting city.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.840]   It's described as Asia's supreme metropolis.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.240]   It wasn't the official capital, that was Pergamum.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.760]   But in some ways, Ephesus was the economic, political and spiritual capital.
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.760]   Maybe very similar to New York.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.160]   Everything was there. Everyone was there.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.560]   Every business was there. All the money was there.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.960]   All the religions were there.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.560]   In fact, the main, the chief cult that was there
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.960]   was a cult that worshipped the goddess Artemis.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.360]   And so John writes and receives this vision from Jesus
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.360]   to tell to the church of Ephesus.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.360]   And as we look through this letter,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.760]   as we look through all the letters in the next few weeks,
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.560]   what I want us to do is, as we look at what Jesus says about this church,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.760]   is ask ourselves, "Is that us?"
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.960]   Can we see any of this in us?
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.160]   And then what are we supposed to do about it?
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.960]   Jesus, as He goes through these different churches,
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   He gives what, in England, we would call good constructive feedback.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.960]   It's called a poo sandwich, where He starts off with something good,
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.360]   then He moves into something less good,
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.160]   and then He finishes off with a bit of encouragement at the end.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.560]   And as we look at this constructive feedback that Jesus gives these churches,
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.760]   I ask you to look into your own heart.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.960]   I look into my own heart.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.560]   And we, as a church, ask, "Is Jesus saying this to us right now?"
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.160]   And so this is the first one.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.960]   And we're going to look at it.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.760]   And you can turn there.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.360]   Actually, we've got it on the screen.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.760]   And it's Revelation 2, verse 1-7.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.760]   And I want to go through each verse.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.160]   I haven't got three points today.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.760]   We've got seven verses, so we're just going to go through it one by one.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.360]   Okay?
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.960]   So the first verse is this, and I'll read it to you.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.360]   And it says this, Chapter 2, verse 1.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.760]   "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.960]   'The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand,
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.360]   who walks among the seven golden lampstands.'"
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.160]   So Jesus reveals to John in a vision, and He tells him to write this down.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.760]   And He sends a message to the angel of the church in Ephesus.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.160]   And He says, "The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand."
[00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.360]   What are the seven stars?
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.960]   If you look at the end of Chapter 1, you'll see, verse 20,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.560]   "As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand,
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.960]   and the seven golden lampstands,
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.560]   the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.960]   So He's holding the angels, and then, here's the key sentence,
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.160]   He walks among the seven golden lampstands.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.360]   This is my first observation.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.560]   Jesus walks amongst the church.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.360]   Jesus knows the church.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.560]   He writes to the church and calls the church by name.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.360]   And He knows the church, and later we'll see, He knows the works of the church.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.760]   He knows all these different things.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.760]   And the first observation is that Jesus knows the church.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   Jesus knows us.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.160]   I want to ask you, how do you feel if I told you that Jesus knows you,
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.560]   and is walking amongst you?
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.960]   How would you feel if Jesus was sat right here?
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.560]   Can you just pause for a moment and just imagine
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.560]   if Jesus Christ Himself was sat on this chair?
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.560]   How would you feel?
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.560]   What would you be thinking?
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.360]   What would you think about that you've done this last week?
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.560]   What would you be thinking about what you need to address and do now?
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.960]   You see, Christine and I, we entered into full-time ministry a good few years ago,
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.560]   and we dedicated our lives to spending our time to talking about Jesus,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.960]   to doing work for Jesus, to serving Jesus.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.760]   You know, I'll confess to you, sometimes I forget that He's next to me.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.960]   I forget that He's walking beside me.
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.360]   I fail to acknowledge His presence, His existence in my life.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.560]   How about you?
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.560]   For those of us who have grown up in the church,
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.160]   who know all this stuff, who know how to talk about Jesus,
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.560]   who know how to serve Jesus and do all these things,
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.360]   how aware are we of Jesus' presence in our lives?
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.960]   KFCI, how aware are we that Jesus is walking amongst us?
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.160]   Who walks among the seven golden lampstands?
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.560]   He's actually walking with us.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.960]   He is here right now, and He knows us.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   I don't know about you, that gives me a little bit of an uneasy feeling.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.960]   Because Jesus is actually right here.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.560]   He's actually seeing what I'm doing.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.160]   He actually knows what I'm thinking.
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.760]   He actually knows, He can see how I'm treating other people.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.960]   Jesus knows us.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.960]   Jesus is walking amongst the church.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.560]   Verse 2.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.160]   "I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance,
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.960]   and how you cannot bear with those who are evil,
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.760]   but have tested those who call themselves apostles and none are,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.160]   and found them to be false."
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.760]   This is the model church that we in Hong Kong revere.
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.160]   A church, Jesus says here, "Hey, I know your works.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.360]   I know your good works.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.960]   You guys do good stuff.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.560]   You do good Bible studies.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.960]   You do good prayer groups.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.760]   You do good outreach.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.960]   You do good 101s and 102s and 103s.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   You do good things.
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.160]   I see that.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.760]   I see you, church.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.960]   You are good."
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.560]   Then He says, "I know your toil.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.760]   I know it's not easy.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.360]   I know that you guys are diligent.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.760]   You are hard workers.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.960]   Things are not easy outside.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.760]   What was not easy?
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.960]   The church in Ephesus was stuck between two big, big powers,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.760]   the Roman Empire and the temple.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.160]   And it was hard, but still they were doing good work.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.360]   They were hard workers.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   Does this sound familiar?
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.560]   Does this sound like a church that we here in Hong Kong strive to be?
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.560]   That we do lots of good stuff, that we work hard?
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.960]   Isn't it natural to us that that's what we do?
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.160]   And so Jesus is saying to this church in Ephesus,
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   "I see you.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.560]   I see you're doing these things.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   What else do I see?
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.760]   And your patient endurance."
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.160]   As I said, it wasn't easy at that time.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.360]   The patient endurance really represents a persistence in faith.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.160]   So this church had gone on for a couple of generations now.
[00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.360]   The early church fathers, the ones who maybe spent time with Jesus himself,
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.560]   or spent time with Paul, they had now gone.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.960]   And now the church was filled with people, their children,
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.360]   their children's children, their children's children's friends,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.960]   and all the people had just joined the faith.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.760]   And things were not easy.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.360]   In fact, they were very hard.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.160]   But yet they showed patient endurance.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   That meant that even in the midst of the tough times,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.160]   even in the midst of not seeing where the hope was,
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.360]   where the future was, they were still committed.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.960]   And Jesus saw that.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.960]   So this was a resilient group.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.160]   This, right now so far, is a good church.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.960]   Right?
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.760]   It's a good church.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.360]   It's one that we all, in some ways, strive to be.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   And how you cannot bear with those who are evil.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.360]   So not only was it hard working, not only did it have good programs,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.560]   it also was committed to the truth.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.960]   It wasn't compromised.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:45.560]   Ephesus was full of different people, different distractions.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.960]   And yet it remained true to the biblical truths.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.360]   It stayed and it could not bear with those who were evil.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.560]   It did not tolerate sin.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.160]   And we'll find out later, there were groups of people within the church
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.960]   who did compromise,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.160]   who started to take advantage of the newfound freedoms,
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.560]   who then started to basically twist the faith to serve themselves,
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.360]   to satisfy their own desires.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.960]   Yet here we see the saying,
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.160]   "How you cannot bear with those who are evil.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.960]   You did not tolerate sin and you stuck with the truth
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.560]   and you were committed to the truth."
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.760]   Still sounds good.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.160]   Still sounds like an A+ kind of church.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.760]   "But have tested those who call themselves apostles
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.560]   and are not and found them to be false."
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.160]   Here again, they are committed to the truth.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160]   They tested the false apostles.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.760]   They tested false preaching.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.560]   During that time, there were different groups.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.960]   There were the Nicolaitans, which we'll read a little bit more later.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.760]   There were the Gnostics,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.360]   who were starting to kind of preach a twisted gospel,
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.760]   where if you got it, you got it.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.760]   You're in the secret club.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.960]   If you are elite, you will get it.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   And they were starting to twist the gospel.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.960]   They would twist what the scripture was teaching.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   But these guys, the church in Ephesus remained true.
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.960]   They stayed and were committed to the truth.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.360]   How did they test the apostles?
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:06.160]   That meant that one, they were knowledgeable in the word of God
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.760]   and that they were also tight-knit,
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:08.760]   that they would be in community.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.360]   They would talk and pray and wrestle with
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.360]   the things that were out there,
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.760]   the distractions that were out there.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.160]   And they would test them against the word of God.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.560]   And they would see that those were false.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.160]   They were committed to the truth.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.560]   Still, what an admirable trait to have.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.960]   What a great church to be a part of.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.760]   And it carries on.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.760]   "I know you are enduring patiently
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.560]   and bearing up for my name's sake,
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.160]   and you have not grown weary."
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.760]   Again, that patient endurance.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.760]   Why? Because there was persecution.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.160]   Brothers and sisters in the church were falling like flies.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.960]   And yet they would still hold on, knowing that this was true.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   Can you imagine how much conviction
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.560]   they would have had to held to the truths in their heart
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.760]   when things weren't going well?
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.760]   See, they had this faith passed down to them
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.360]   from their fathers and from their forefathers.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   And yet here they were, clinging on to doing the right thing,
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.760]   running the right programs, and sticking true to the word,
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.760]   even when it did not serve them well.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.760]   Even when it would have been easier just to tell the Romans,
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.960]   "You know what? It was all for a bit of fun.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   It was quite a good little thing. Don't worry about us.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.760]   We're not going to threaten your power here."
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.560]   And just left it. They didn't.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.760]   They held on to it. They were patiently enduring
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:29.160]   to the point where they did not grow weary.
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.160]   Did not grow weary. Are you weary?
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.360]   Let me tell you, I am weary.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.960]   This last year has been quite a wearisome year.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.360]   But it's interesting.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.160]   When times are tough, when there is suffering,
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:51.360]   that's when our true convictions are revealed or exposed.
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.360]   I don't know about you.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.560]   This last year for me, with all the tough things,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.360]   and Christina and I, we realized that we're really not that good.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.960]   That we really weren't that strong.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.360]   That the things that we thought we put our faith in, we didn't.
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.360]   We keep saying we trust God, but actually,
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.360]   this last year has shown us every time there's an opportunity to be angry,
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.160]   every time there's an opportunity to be frustrated,
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.960]   we take the bait.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.960]   And we realize we're not as strong as we were.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.560]   That the truths that we said, that we declared, that we believed,
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.760]   we kind of believed.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.960]   But when it came to it, when the going got tough,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.160]   our inner self was exposed.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.160]   What about you? Are you weary?
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.160]   See, it's interesting.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.560]   During a time like this, these people here,
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.160]   they were going through persecution.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.160]   They were getting hunted down, driven underground,
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.560]   yet they were patiently enduring.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.760]   The persecution that we face now, if any,
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.560]   was nothing like what they faced here.
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   Now, I don't know how you feel about the future of Hong Kong,
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.160]   and we're not going to talk too much about this,
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.960]   but what if there was one day that we were persecuted in the same way that this was?
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.160]   Where would you stand?
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.560]   How committed to truth are you?
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.160]   If it meant that it would cost you your life.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.360]   If it meant it would cost me my life.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.560]   How committed to truth are you?
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.760]   Are you as committed as these people here?
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:26.760]   This morning, I got sent an article from, written by, I think, Sydney Anglicans.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.560]   And it was talking about how, you know,
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.560]   I won't name the country or the government here,
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.960]   but there's a country that has been tweaking and rewriting the Bible
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.760]   to serve its own purpose.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.160]   Has been twisting certain stories so that when it's taught,
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.360]   it would basically serve the needs of that country instead.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.160]   In some ways, that is a form of persecution that these guys faced.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.160]   They were testing against false teaching.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.360]   Now, and then I thought about this myself.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:00.560]   We're lucky enough that we have the Bible in our hands,
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.560]   and we know that it's the true one.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:06.960]   We have it on our phones. We have the ESV app. We have the Holy Bible app.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.560]   What if that was taken away?
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.560]   What if we didn't have access to that anymore?
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.960]   I think then we would find out how grounded in truth our lives really are.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.560]   So that when we look at stories that may be tweaked by mankind with selfish desires,
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.760]   we would be able to see it.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.960]   We would be able to test it.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.560]   And it convicted me.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.960]   Because I think there'd be parts of the Bible, if someone tweets,
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.560]   I would have no idea that they tweaked it.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.560]   Is that the same with you?
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.960]   But this church here, they were committed to the truth.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.360]   This was a good church.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.360]   And so persecution is a huge threat to the church right here and now.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.960]   But there's something that's maybe even more threatening to the church.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.160]   And I recently heard a speaker, an apologetic speaker, talk about this.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.360]   That actually modernity is an even bigger threat to the church than persecution.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.160]   What's modernity?
[00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.560]   It's what we have in this modern age right now.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.560]   It's social media, it's consumerism, it's materialism.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   These things are even more threatening to the church right now.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.560]   Why? Because it makes us think that all we have to do to get to heaven is turn up to church.
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:17.960]   It makes us think that none of our lives really have to change.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:21.160]   As long as we turn up to church, we will get where we want to be.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   That we don't really need to live out our faith the rest of our lives.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.560]   That we can still live comfortably.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:31.160]   That we can still indulge in the desires of this world and still be okay.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   That we can have other gods around.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.160]   We can have other idols.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.960]   We can climb. We can have other ambitions.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.360]   We don't need to fully follow Christ and that will be enough.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:45.160]   You see, that is a much bigger threat to our church than persecution is right now.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:50.360]   In fact, I think this year, of not having church taken away from us,
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.560]   really has forced us to evaluate what we place our faith in.
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:01.560]   What is the most important thing to us?
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.560]   I've been watching the NBA finals recently.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:10.160]   My team is in the finals, which is why I'm talking about it.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.960]   It's called the Los Angeles Lakers and their best player is LeBron James.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.560]   And he's pitched up against his old coach and arch rival Pat Riley.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.960]   And they both have a saying.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.160]   I think LeBron got it from Pat Riley when he was being coached by him,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.760]   which was "Keep the main thing the main thing."
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.560]   Keep the main thing the main thing.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.760]   And I realise that's the same for us.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:37.360]   When trials come, when suffering comes, do we even know what the main thing is?
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.160]   Do we know why we are here?
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.360]   Are we rooted in truth? Are we committed to Christ?
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.160]   Because when those trials come, that's what's going to be put to test.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.560]   And this church passed.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.760]   In the face of modernity, in the face of all the challenges that we face in this world right now,
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.560]   how are we doing?
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.960]   Are we committed to the truth?
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.760]   You see, the church, us, we have to be different to the people outside.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.960]   We know the truth, so it must impact the way we live.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   So the way we love people, the way we work, the way we study,
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:16.160]   the way we interact, the way we do anything should be different because we know the truth.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.560]   Because we've had the gospel planted in our hearts.
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.760]   We should be different.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.560]   And there's another way we should be different.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   And that's what? In the way that we love.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.960]   So not only should we be committed to truth like this church here, like this A+ church here,
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.760]   but we must also be different in the way we love.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.960]   And that's where this church fails.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.960]   And that's where Jesus has something to say against them.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.560]   The next verse, verse 4.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:52.360]   "But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first."
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.160]   This is the bad bit.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.960]   "But I have this against you, this A+ church that has all these good works,
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:06.160]   that works hard, that patiently endures, that holds on to the truth, that tests false teaching.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.960]   I have this against you. You have abandoned your first love."
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.760]   Wow.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.160]   The main thing was not necessarily truth.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.760]   The main thing was not necessarily works.
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.160]   The main thing was love.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.160]   And you abandoned it.
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.760]   And abandoned is a strong word.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.160]   Another version uses forsaken.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.760]   You've left behind. You've ran away from it.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.560]   "I have this against you. You have abandoned your first love."
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.760]   Have any of us here abandoned our first love?
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.360]   Pastor John talked a bit about this earlier.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.760]   Do you remember the time when you first encountered Christ?
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.360]   When you first fell in love with Jesus?
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.160]   How did it make you feel?
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.560]   What did it make you do?
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:58.960]   How did it change your life?
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.760]   Are you still there right now?
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.160]   It's hard, right?
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   It's hard to keep that kind of thing going.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.160]   In some ways it's the same as relationships, the same as married life.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.360]   Alex and Kara, you got married recently, so maybe that first love is still fully there.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.960]   This month, it's Christina and I's 10 year anniversary.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.760]   This month.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.160]   Oh, thank you. That's good. Thank you.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.560]   I was going to take her around the world and do everything and splash out.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:37.360]   But because of COVID, we're going to go to Mong Kok.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.960]   And Christina will tell you, actually we've been married for 10 years, but we've been dating for 20.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:50.360]   And I remember in the early days where you'd receive a letter or you'd get an SMS or even better, you get an ICQ.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:56.160]   Oh, only old people will recognize that one.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.560]   I said, oh, she messaged me.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.160]   Oh, she put an X at the end of the message.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:08.360]   Two X's. Capital X. She misses me.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.960]   I'm going to see her again.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.560]   And now it's like, oh, you again.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:19.360]   Why are you still here? Don't you have some place to be?
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   And many of you here are married for even longer.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:28.160]   And you will know that to even maintain that kind of enthusiasm and that passion, it takes work.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:35.560]   And if you're not careful, if you abandon that first love, if you forget why you were here in the first place, you run into some problems.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.160]   How did Jesus know that they had abandoned their first love?
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.960]   You see, it's quite a hard thing to judge, right?
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.560]   How did he know that they'd abandoned their first love?
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.760]   They were doing good works. They were doing good Bible studies.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.360]   They were going to BSF. They were running outreach programs.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.760]   They were doing all the right things.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:55.360]   How did he know that they had abandoned their first love?
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:05.560]   A lot of commentators would say that the way he knew, or the way that they had lost their first love was because they stopped loving each other.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.760]   That was it.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.160]   You see, loving God and loving people comes hand in hand.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.760]   If you realize that you're not loving people as much as probably because you've stopped loving God,
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.360]   that they are so close and intertwined together.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.960]   And if you love God, you can't help but love people.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.960]   And actually, the Apostle Paul, when he writes to this church in Ephesus in the book of Ephesians, chapter 1, verse 15,
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:33.160]   he gives thanks for the love that they had for each other.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.560]   And now we see how far they have fallen. They have forgotten their first love.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.960]   They have abandoned their first love.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.560]   It's down to us to not abandon our first love.
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:45.760]   Another question.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.960]   So that's how Jesus knew that they had abandoned their first love, because they'd stopped loving each other.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.160]   But why did they stop loving each other?
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.760]   How did that happen?
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.960]   How do we stop loving each other?
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.760]   My guess is pride.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.360]   You see, it's really interesting.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:11.760]   When you first meet Jesus, you encounter His holiness and His purity and also His love.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:20.360]   And you also are reminded and shown your own depravity, your own weakness, the depth of your sin.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:27.160]   Peter, when he first meets Jesus, goes down on his knees and says, "Depart from me, Lord, because I am a sinner."
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.160]   And so maybe it's the same for you.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:35.160]   When you first met Jesus, you realised the depth of your sin.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:42.160]   And it's only when you realise the depth of your sin do you get to appreciate the depth of His love.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:47.960]   Because unless you know where you've gone wrong, you won't know how good He is to you.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:55.560]   It's very hard to sing, "How great is your love" or "How great are you, God," if you think you're quite great yourself.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.760]   So then what we have here is then pride.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.760]   And why do I know that?
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.960]   They are so committed to all the other things.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:04.360]   They are so committed to knowledge, to truth.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.360]   But maybe that's where the problem lies.
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.360]   Because you see, you remember from the beginning.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.360]   You first meet Jesus and you realise and you're on the ground.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.160]   And you just don't actually...
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:16.560]   The apostle John here at the very beginning, chapter 1, verse 17,
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:21.160]   "When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as though dead."
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.360]   That's the first exposure, that's the first encounter to the holiness of God.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.560]   But then you realise, "Oh my goodness, He loves me.
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.760]   I'm allowed to be here."
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:39.960]   And that gratefulness, that release, that you're forgiven, suddenly just completely opens up a whole new world.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.560]   And yet the problem is then, after that, you start committing to good things.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.760]   "Oh, you know what? Now I'm saved by Jesus. I'm going to start going to church.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.360]   I'm going to start going to clan. I'm going to start going to BSF."
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.560]   And suddenly what happens? These are all good things, by the way.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:59.360]   Slowly, you start to feel better about yourself, which in some ways is not a bad thing.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.760]   But then as you accumulate more knowledge, you start thinking, "You know what? I'm not so bad myself.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:07.560]   I'm pretty good. I'm a decent person."
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:12.560]   And whilst that in itself is not a terrible thing, the risk is you start thinking,
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.560]   "Hmm, maybe my debt for my sin isn't that much."
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.960]   And the problem then is that you start thinking, "Hmm, how much does God really need to love me?
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.560]   I'm pretty easy to love."
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.960]   And then you have this pride. And then suddenly you think, "Oh, look at them.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.760]   Oh, you see, I'm so much better than them. I'm doing all these different things.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:37.760]   I'm doing so many works. I'm toiling away. I am patiently enduring. And look at them."
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.160]   I think that's where the problem lies.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.560]   As we go on this journey, as we accumulate more knowledge, as we go on this path, which are all good things,
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.760]   you see, the Paul talks about this, that knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.560]   And so that's where this church has gone wrong.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.960]   And I wonder whether it's where we have gone wrong.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:02.160]   We have been so engrossed with living a Christian life, engrossed with learning Bible verses,
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   engrossed with forming our views on predestination and eschatology,
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:12.960]   that we have not allowed the main thing to still be the main thing.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   Love is the main thing. And it's so important for us to remember that.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:24.360]   So I wonder whether church, and actually for us in Hong Kong, for us as Chinese people, we love to learn.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.560]   We love to accumulate knowledge. We love a good expository sermon.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.360]   We love a good Bible study in Leviticus.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:38.560]   But I wonder whether even though it is a good thing that we have put it as the very top thing,
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:42.360]   when the very, very top thing is to love.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.160]   Jesus' final prayer before he leaves was that we would love each other.
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:54.160]   His final declaration was that you will be known as my disciples if you love each other.
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.960]   That is the key. And maybe that's where this church went wrong.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.560]   And this is where, for me, I'm trying to remind myself, this is not where I go wrong.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.960]   Let's carry on.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   Verse 5.
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   So Jesus doesn't leave them there.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.960]   So he gives them some good stuff, then he gives them the really bad stuff,
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.760]   and then he shows them how to address this.
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.360]   And he gives them three very simple points.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.960]   He says, "Remember, repent, and do."
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.160]   Remember, repent, and do. What does remember mean?
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.160]   Remember means think back to when you first met me.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.560]   Your first state, when you realised who you were, how lost you were, how you were in darkness.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.560]   But I came to you. Remember that.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.160]   Because when you remember that, you remember the depth of your sin.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.760]   And then you will realise again the depth of my love.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.760]   And then you will be compelled to love others.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.560]   So remember. It's the same as married couples who have maybe lost our way.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:59.160]   It's go back to why we got married in the first place.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.760]   What was the thing that I loved about you the most?
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.760]   And so you remember that.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.360]   For us as a church, we remember why we came to this church in the first place.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.960]   What drew us here? Why did God call us here? What has he called us to do?
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.760]   Remember. To look back and remember.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.760]   And to see how far we've fallen.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.160]   And what's the second step? To repent.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.960]   Repent is to turn away. To realise that you've taken the wrong way and turn away.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.360]   Just like this church, they were all good things.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.360]   And actually many, many things start with the right intentions.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.360]   They start with love.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.560]   The early church fathers, when they put these Bible studies and these services
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:37.760]   and these teachings and prayer groups in place,
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.360]   they were all done out of love.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.760]   Because they loved Jesus and they loved each other.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   So they put these things in place so that they can show each other more love.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:49.560]   Yet somewhere along the line, they took a wrong turn.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:55.960]   And mankind has this uncanny ability to corrupt anything that starts with good intentions.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.360]   That even though it was started right, somewhere along the line,
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.960]   whether it's ourselves or someone we pass it to, eventually we lose our way.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:09.160]   And Jesus is saying, "Go back. Remember. Then repent. Turn around and head back that way."
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.560]   And what's the best thing to do after that? Is do.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.960]   Do the things that you did at first.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.360]   Married couples, start talking to each other again.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.760]   Start asking each other questions about how their day has been.
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.360]   What kind of food they like the most. Or just anything new.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:29.960]   Do those things. Go out on dates. Talk to each other. Spend time with each other.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.760]   And do the things. Find new hobbies.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.160]   As for the church, go back to the things that are the most important.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.760]   What are the main things?
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.960]   How are the ways that you can show love? Go back to those things.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.160]   Remember, repent and do.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.160]   I think that's a message for us as well.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.560]   Remember how you got here at the beginning.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.360]   Remember the darkness where God plucked you out from.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.760]   And then repent and realise that you've made a mistake.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.360]   God is gracious like that. His mercy is on you every day.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:03.360]   And then do. Live it out again.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.560]   It's important to live it out because if not, the consequences are severe.
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.160]   What are the consequences? The end of that verse.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:19.960]   If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place unless you repent.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.760]   If you don't do these things, if you don't remember, repent and live it out,
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.560]   what will Jesus do? Remove the lampstand.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.960]   All these churches that made it into the Bible,
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.160]   these seven churches that Jesus writes to, all the ones that Paul writes to,
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   they made it into the Bible. These were good churches.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:43.960]   I haven't been to Israel or to the Holy Land myself, but for those who have been,
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:50.760]   they tell me that if you go and visit these churches, what do you find? Rocks.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.960]   These churches made it into the Word of God, made it into the Scriptures,
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.560]   yet they did not survive. They ceased to exist.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:04.960]   It makes me think, what right do I have to even think that a church like ours, KFCI, will exist forever?
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:11.560]   What Jesus is saying here is, if you cease to exist for the purpose that I have called you for,
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.760]   you will cease to exist.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.960]   It makes me think that if we do not honour why God has placed us here,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:23.760]   if we do not truly reflect His love, we could be gone.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.760]   And not because, OK, one way we could go is because if we stop loving each other,
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.560]   we'll just self-destruct and then the church will disband. That has happened before, right?
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:38.160]   Another way, so Jesus is saying, if you don't stick to the main thing, which is loving,
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.760]   you will cease to exist.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.360]   But He's very prepared to do it Himself. He says, here,
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:48.960]   if not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:55.960]   I will do it because you're not reflecting me to the world.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:01.760]   What's the main argument against us as Christians, why believers don't want to come into the church?
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:07.960]   That you're no better than us. That you're a bunch of hypocrites.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.960]   That you argue within yourselves.
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:17.160]   Why on earth would I want to come into you when I can get all the argument I can have outside?
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:24.760]   You guys are the same. And you read all this stuff. And you're still the same.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:30.760]   That's my conviction. That's where I feel that I need always to work on, to remind myself.
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:38.160]   That this is why we were placed here, to love. And if we cease to fulfil that, we may cease to exist.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:43.560]   See, we come to KFCI thinking that it's been around forever and that it will exist forever.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:49.160]   But that's not the case. Things change. But the body of Christ should remain.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.760]   Our love for Him and our love for each other should remain.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   That is the key takeaway for me. Let's carry on. Verse 6.
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.960]   "Yet this you have. You hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:09.360]   So Jesus, after doing that bad bit, after that threat of "I will destroy you all,"
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.560]   he then says, "But you guys still do some good stuff."
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:19.560]   The Nicolaitans were a heretical sect that had made compromises and arrangements with pagan society
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:26.360]   to basically say, "Hey, we have newfound spiritual freedoms. That should allow us to do whatever we want to do.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.360]   So let's try and do both. Let's try and appear to be godly and holy,
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.760]   but let's also still indulge in everything that we want to indulge in."
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.160]   And that was that group. And so Jesus is saying here to them, "Hey, Church of Ephesus,
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.760]   but you are still doing a good job. There are so many temptations out there,
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:48.960]   so many distractions, so many compromises, but yet you guys have remained faithful to me.
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.360]   You still do not tolerate sin. You cannot bear with evil. So you are doing well."
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.960]   You see, interesting word here, "You hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.560]   So he's saying that, well done. Not that they hate the Nicolaitans.
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.360]   Remember, they hate the works of the Nicolaitans.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.760]   That reminds me of a common saying, "We're not supposed to hate the sinner.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.160]   We're supposed to just hate the sin."
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:18.360]   Again, this is part of what we as a church should have in terms of our identity and our ethos,
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:23.560]   is not to look outside and go, "Those guys are sinners. God will judge you.
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:25.960]   And because of that, I hate you."
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.760]   And there's this cancel culture now that we have where we disagree with one thing that person stands for,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:36.760]   and we dismiss them entirely, and we just declare ourselves free to not need to love them anymore.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.360]   But here, Jesus is saying, "I respect what you do, Church of Ephesus,
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.560]   because you hate the works of the Nicolaitans."
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.760]   And that is our calling as well, that we hate the things of this world,
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.960]   but we don't hate the people of the world.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:54.560]   That our job is to love those who are still indulged in darkness, who are still indulged in sin.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:34:00.160]   Our job is to love them just like Jesus loved us when he plucked us out from darkness as well.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:05.960]   It is not our place to judge their political stance. It's not our place to judge their sexuality.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.160]   It is not our place to look down on them because of their race.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:16.360]   But it is our job to love them, regardless if we disagree with anything that they do.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:23.160]   That is our calling as a church, to love, to keep the main thing the main thing.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:25.160]   That is the most important.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:29.960]   And finally, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:37.560]   To the one who conquers, I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God."
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.360]   And he finishes this, and he finishes this with the Isletters very similarly as well.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.960]   "He who has an ear, let him hear."
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   Jesus said this when he was alive. You see in the Gospels. What does it mean?
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.160]   It just means everyone, listen up.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:57.160]   It's the part where the preacher goes, "If you don't get anything from my sermon, listen to this."
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.960]   Take it seriously. Listen.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:03.760]   "He who has an ear," and everyone here has ears, at least I think so.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.760]   Everyone has an ear. Listen to what the Spirit is saying to the church.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   Take heed of this advice. Take it seriously.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:17.360]   Put into your mind what I'm saying right now.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.160]   So the one who conquers, and it is a battle. It isn't easy to love.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.560]   Why is love even a commandment?
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.560]   We're not commanded to eat food. We're not commanded to go to the toilet.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:33.160]   We're not commanded to sleep. We're commanded to love because it's the hardest thing to do.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.560]   It's the one thing that Jesus says time and time again.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.360]   The greatest commandment is to love God and love people.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:44.760]   And he commands us because he knows how hard it is and that we will forget.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.760]   Love these people. Choose to love these people.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:54.360]   Listen to me and choose to find your first love again and love God and love people.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.560]   And if you choose that, you are basically choosing the tree of life.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.160]   In the Garden of Eden, if you remember, there were two trees.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:06.960]   There was one tree of life and there's another tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.760]   And Jesus is saying, "Choose me."
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:17.360]   Choose me in every decision that you make, whether big or small in your life, every single day.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:24.760]   Choose me. And if you choose me, you will be with me in Paradise.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.160]   And how do you choose him?
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:33.960]   You choose to love him and love the people around him with any opportunity that you are given.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:43.560]   Brothers and sisters of KFCI, this letter to the Church of Ephesus, I believe, can also be a letter to us.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   I think it also can be a letter to you, to me, to not abandon our first love.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.760]   To remember that is the main thing.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.360]   Keep the main thing the main thing.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:09.160]   Let's pray.
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:19.160]   Father, we thank you that you loved us enough to sacrifice your Son for us.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:29.760]   And Jesus, we thank you that you chose to come to this earth to show us how to love.
[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:35.160]   And Spirit, we thank you for being so gracious to us that you would speak this message to us.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:41.160]   And we who have ears commit to listening to you.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:50.960]   That we will not rely on our good works or our resilience, but that we rely on you, our love for you.
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:57.760]   And may that spur us on to loving those around us.
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:05.760]   So we spend just a moment now reacquainting ourselves with you.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   And maybe it's quite appropriate as we haven't spent any time together for these last few months,
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:18.160]   that as we sit here together, as a community, as a family,
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:27.960]   we embrace all the good feelings about being together again and that we look to you together
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.160]   and choose not to abandon our first love.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   That we remember what brought us here in the first place and that is you.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:47.760]   So while some of us may have come to church this evening to see friends, to sing songs,
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:57.760]   to listen to a message, the truth is we should have come here to see you.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:04.360]   And we remember that you walk amongst our church, you walk with us here.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:11.760]   And we are comforted by that fact that even though the world outside around us is swirling of uncertainty,
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:23.760]   you Lord are here with us and that your love for us is so deep and so wide,
[00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:29.160]   there is nothing we can do to be separated from it.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:33.160]   So we humble ourselves before you now.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.960]   We thank you for your grace.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:48.960]   We celebrate that we are forgiven and we commit to loving you all the days of our lives.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.960]   And we pray this in your precious name. Amen.
