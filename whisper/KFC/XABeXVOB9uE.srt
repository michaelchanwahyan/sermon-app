1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 - Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,960
 I'm really glad that we can just worship together online.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,080
 And I even get my own chair for the very first time.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,520
 And while just letting you know that I won't be able to see your faces, so if you're falling

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
 asleep, I won't know at all.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
 But I'm imagining that you're sitting at the edge of your seat.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,040
 So let's hope that imagination is the reality.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,640
 But I just wanted to say that it's just great to be able to worship together.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,940
 And for the last two weeks, we have been looking at the sermon series, which is on health for

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,960
 all and all for God.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,840
 And we had two excellent sermons by Pastor James and Pastor John.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,800
 And if you've missed it, please go back to it.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,600
 And we're just gonna continue this week on Break the Power of the Past.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,020
 Now before we actually dig into any sermons, I do wanna tell a short story.

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,440
 So there was someone and he went to a party.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,920
 You know how parties are, there's lots of food.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,360
 And so he goes to the kitchen and he sees this hostess.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,640
 And the hostess begins to prepare this meat.

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,640
 Do we have this meat up?

20
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,220
 Oh, yeah, we do have this meat up.

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,360
 And so he begins to cut the sides, just cut the two sides flat.

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,020
 And he puts it in this oven that's huge.

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,280
 And so this guest has no idea why is the hostess doing that?

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,080
 I mean, the meat is barely enough for everybody and she's already cutting it off.

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,960
 And so she goes and asks the hostess, why is it that you're cutting off the sides?

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,840
 And so to his surprise, the hostess says, well, I don't really know, but my mom has

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,800
 been doing it all along.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,560
 Now, interesting enough, her mom was also at the party.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,000
 So he goes over to her and asks, Auntie, so what is it that makes you wanna cut off the

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,560
 sides 'cause obviously the oven's quite big?

31
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,560
 And interestingly enough, she answers the same way, well, I don't really know, but that's

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,920
 what my mother has always done.

33
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,240
 And so an opportunity arise and the whole family and this guest got to go to the hostess

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,400
 grandma's place, which is actually at a cottage.

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,360
 And so they were there and this guest remembers this interesting scene.

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,060
 So he goes and asks grandma, why is it that you cut off the size of this meat?

37
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,180
 And she's like, oh, well, it's very simple, come in my kitchen.

38
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,320
 So they all went to the kitchen and lo and behold, they found that the oven was very

39
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
 small.

40
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,080
 And so grandma says, well, my oven's too small and I could never fit the entire piece of

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,760
 meat in, so I always had to chop it off.

42
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,400
 And so, I mean, that's actually a perfect illustration of what we mean when we say the

43
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,960
 power of the past.

44
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,560
 And sometimes we don't even know why we do certain things.

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,440
 And it's okay if things are perfect or if they're rosy, right?

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,640
 But what if the things that we're going through has negative impacts in our lives?

47
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,800
 Then really we need to look into the past and make sure that in Christ, we get to break

48
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
 that bondage or that chain.

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,680
 And so today, this is exactly what we're going to talk about.

50
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,920
 And so when we talk about what paths are we actually trying to break?

51
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,880
 Now there are great, wonderful traditions, blessings, and even inheritance that we would

52
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,740
 receive from our parents and also from previous generations.

53
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,200
 So if you're a kind, loving person because your father and mother are that way and that

54
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,760
 you have learned it through experience to be such a person, well, we don't want you

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,360
 to break that.

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,600
 Or if your parents have a condo or two, you know, it's pretty expensive in Hong Kong,

57
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,600
 right?

58
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,800
 That they want to give you as an inheritance, well, we don't want you to break that either.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,240
 So today we're just going to focus on the past in terms of the sins that have been more

60
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,980
 or less passed on or the strongholds, which includes beliefs and values that do not align

61
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,160
 with the Bible.

62
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:23,000
 And the third thing is ungodly characters that we have somehow developed or have got

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,620
 that passed me on.

64
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,460
 So just want to say that we're going to focus on the negatives.

65
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,960
 So I'm not saying that the great things are not in our minds, but this won't be the focus

66
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
 for today.

67
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,600
 But so how are these things formed?

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,640
 And you know, with the earlier illustration, we kind of see that first is from the family

69
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,220
 of origin and second are from events and also past experiences that we have.

70
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,400
 And actually from the author of Emotionally Healthy Church, we actually realized that

71
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,840
 in order to be healthy churches, people actually need to understand how their past have affected

72
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,280
 their present ability to love Christ and others.

73
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:11,400
 And it's important that they've realized that from scripture and life, that an intricate,

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,320
 complex relationship exists between the kind of person they are today and their past.

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,720
 And numerous external forces may shape us, but the family we have grown in is the primary,

76
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,480
 I mean, except in rare circumstances, the most powerful system that will shape and influence

77
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,060
 who we are.

78
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,880
 So if you have brothers or sisters, or if you have young children at home, or if you're

79
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,640
 going to be future parents, and also for yourself, you want to make sure that we're all getting

80
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,040
 this together.

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,280
 So now let us look at a character from the Bible, from the book of Genesis, which is

82
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,400
 Abraham.

83
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,120
 Now Abraham is a great man of faith, but at the same time, he also has some character

84
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,040
 flaws and sins.

85
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,920
 And if we look at Genesis chapter 12, we're going to see that God at the very beginning,

86
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,320
 he promises him an inheritance.

87
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,120
 He says, "I will make you into a great nation.

88
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,600
 I will bless you.

89
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,000
 I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing."

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
 And other nations will also be blessed by him.

91
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,480
 However, in the same chapter, when we get to a famine where they had to go to Egypt

92
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,880
 for food, we already see that he tells the first lie that we're going to see, which is

93
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,200
 when the Egyptians were there, he told his wife, Sarai, at that point, which later would

94
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,240
 be called Sarah, that they are going to kill me for your sake.

95
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,680
 So just say to them that you are my sister, and they will treat me well, and my life would

96
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,240
 be spared.

97
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,960
 And so Sarah was taken to Pharaoh's palace, while Abraham strategizes, and it worked,

98
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:07,200
 because he then received a lot of cows and goats, and also these servants, in which became

99
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,840
 his wealth.

100
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,200
 And so as we read on, of course, Pharaoh finds out, because God was protecting him.

101
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,080
 And after confronting him, Pharaoh let them go.

102
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,560
 So we thought, okay, maybe it was just a one-time thing.

103
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,840
 But does anybody remember if he did it again?

104
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,000
 Okay, I suspect that you're nodding your head behind the screen there.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,640
 Yes, so he did it again.

106
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,920
 And in Genesis chapter 20, the same thing happened.

107
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,560
 There was another famine.

108
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,960
 Instead of going to Egypt, they went to King Abimelech.

109
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,720
 And in that moment, he also told the other people, and also his wife, tell them that

110
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,080
 you're my sister.

111
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,840
 And he told everyone, she is my sister.

112
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,480
 And again, Sarah must be beautiful, because again, the king took her into the palace,

113
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,240
 and God had to intervene before the king would confront Abraham again.

114
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,200
 So what we see is, even though we have a song that sings, "Father Abraham," okay, I'm not

115
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:15,360
 going to go down that route, that we only talk about the great things, but he also has

116
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,360
 these sins and these character traits that aren't so pretty.

117
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,200
 And when we look at it, he really was quite selfish.

118
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,120
 He was putting his wife's life on the line.

119
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,280
 She could be raped, and there could be other things that happened to her for his own benefit.

120
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,800
 And at the same time, he was cheating, and he was deceiving.

121
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,680
 And we thought that it might just end there.

122
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,120
 But does it end there?

123
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,400
 No, I know you're shaking your head back there.

124
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,280
 No, what happens?

125
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
 So he has a son.

126
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,160
 Well, he has two sons, Ishmael from the Egyptian slave, and then he also has Isaac.

127
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,360
 And does Isaac do the same thing?

128
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,920
 Yes, he does.

129
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,000
 And where is that?

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,680
 Well, in Genesis chapter 26, we see that in the same way that there was a famine, that

131
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,800
 they again went to the same king, Abimelech.

132
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,880
 I don't know, this king must be nuts, driven by the same family and being tricked twice,

133
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:22,600
 that he said the same thing, that Rebecca, which is his wife, he claims to be his sister,

134
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,480
 because he was afraid that his life would be taken.

135
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:31,240
 So what we see is that one kind of sin, lying and cheating and deceiving and having this

136
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,800
 selfishness about just thinking about himself, continues on in this family.

137
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,300
 And you know, it doesn't stop there either.

138
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,600
 So it continues to go on.

139
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,560
 David has two sons and they're twins, Esau and Jacob.

140
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,080
 And we see that in his old age when he wanted to bless them, but his eyesight was actually

141
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
 failing him at that point.

142
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,040
 And what we find is that Jacob again, deceives his father.

143
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,560
 And this deceiving, this cheating continues on.

144
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,560
 And for those who have read Genesis know the story quite well, where he wanted the first

145
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:18,920
 born blessing so badly that his mother schemed it where they would pretend to be Esau to

146
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,420
 receive that blessing.

147
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,000
 And so it continues.

148
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,360
 Does it stop there?

149
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,440
 No, I know you're tired now.

150
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,280
 You're probably not shaking your head.

151
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,880
 I'll shake it for you.

152
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,520
 And so no, right?

153
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,840
 The next one that we find is that Jacob has 12 sons.

154
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,520
 And of course his favorite one was Joseph.

155
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,000
 And so his brother then schemed, deceived, cheated and decided that we're going to murder

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 him.

157
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,640
 But nah, because if we murder him, we're not going to get any benefit.

158
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,520
 Remember this family is all about benefits, right?

159
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,520
 So what do they do?

160
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,400
 Well, let's sell him because at least we can get something.

161
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,360
 So it runs in the family again, not only deceiving, not only being selfish, now sibling rivalries

162
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,600
 we see and also for money.

163
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,320
 So all of these we see are sins that even in this family, and we know how blessed Abraham

164
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,760
 and his descendants are, have it.

165
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,800
 I mean, in the same way, you and I are also in this kind of position.

166
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,000
 I mean, we might have family, we might come from families that are divorced or single

167
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,400
 parent and that has a negative effect on us, our security, our feeling of being confident

168
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,760
 or there may be other things.

169
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,000
 For example, maybe there's a sickness that runs in the family or a continual habitual

170
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,480
 addiction that your family might be struggling with and you eventually find yourself kind

171
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,440
 of in the same position.

172
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,520
 So today we really want to just break all of those things, break from the past.

173
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,440
 And so when we read on in Exodus 20, this is where we see the Lord telling us where

174
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,680
 does this all kind of generational curses seem to be coming from.

175
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,400
 And so in verse one to five, it literally says that, and God spoke all these words.

176
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,480
 This is where they were on Mount Sinai and Moses was receiving the 10 commandments from

177
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
 the Lord.

178
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,560
 And he says, "I am the Lord, your God, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land

179
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,700
 of slavery.

180
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,960
 You shall have no other gods before me.

181
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,940
 You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything."

182
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:36,160
 In verse five, "You shall not bow down to them or worship them for I, the Lord, your

183
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,420
 God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of their parents to the third

184
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:49,160
 and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations

185
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,080
 of those who love me and keep my commandments."

186
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,360
 And when we read this at first, we see, wow, God's great.

187
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,880
 He loves us so much that he's going to show love to us over a thousand generation.

188
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,400
 But there seems to be a line that we're a little bit disturbed where it says that God's

189
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:14,000
 going to punish the children for the sins of their parents to the third and fourth generation.

190
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,600
 And sometimes we think in our mind, well, that's unfair.

191
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,400
 Well, I didn't do anything wrong.

192
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,120
 Why am I being punished for something that someone did?

193
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,680
 Well, if we look closely at the word punish in Hebrew, it actually means kind of like

194
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:35,320
 visiting, or in the ESV version is like visiting the inequity of the fathers on the children.

195
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:42,320
 Well, really what this means is that God's not actively punishing us for something that

196
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
 our forefathers did.

197
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:51,880
 But he's saying that the consequences of what sins or sinful nature, the things that they've

198
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:57,160
 done in the past continues to be naturally manifested into our lives.

199
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,880
 I mean, one simple one would be how Adam and Eve had ate the forbidden food where they

200
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,640
 were not supposed to eat from the tree of good and evil, but they did.

201
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:17,280
 As much as God loves us, there's a consequence of sin, which is death, and it continues on,

202
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,520
 and that's why we also need to die.

203
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:26,680
 So we see that it's not a punishing way, but it's the consequence of what happens.

204
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:34,640
 And so I want to share as well that actually in my life, I have definitely found there

205
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:44,840
 are so many paths that were entangling me in terms of my emotional and physical well-being,

206
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,120
 and one of that was actually suicidal thoughts.

207
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,340
 And the truth be told is that about 10 years ago, and I think at some point I've shared

208
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,340
 with some of you that I had suicidal thoughts.

209
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:03,740
 And I did mention that I don't think I would have ever taken any action just because the

210
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:07,720
 thought of that is quite scary itself.

211
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:16,120
 However, that thought actually made me seem demotivated, and I will wake up every day

212
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,760
 not having the meaning to go on, not wanting to go on, and always praying the prayer, "God,

213
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,520
 please take me home.

214
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,800
 Take me because I can't do this."

215
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:34,360
 And it was a hopeless and also helpless state of mind.

216
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:41,280
 And when I looked back, I realized that not only haunted me, but actually it also haunted

217
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,600
 my family.

218
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,480
 One of it being the first was my aunt.

219
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:53,520
 Actually I've never met her, but I heard that after she gave birth to three children and

220
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,840
 having a really tough time in her life, she committed suicide.

221
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:05,200
 She jumped off the building, and I mean, it's in the family.

222
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:13,800
 And so when my grandma found out, she got really depressed as well, and she wasn't able

223
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,880
 to eat much.

224
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:23,500
 And actually quite soon after my aunt's death, she passed away.

225
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:30,640
 And actually just three years ago, actually, my uncle also committed suicide.

226
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:37,040
 He actually walked out into the ocean, and he actually don't know how to swim.

227
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,720
 And so eventually he was found, and I don't want to go to too much details, but what I

228
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:53,340
 do want to say is that there is a strong power that continues to hinder us.

229
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:59,340
 And if we don't look into it, it can easily actually come into our lives.

230
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:06,580
 And when I had the chance to sit with counselors and also read books and listen to sermons,

231
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:13,060
 I realized that, I mean, what was really causing these suicidal thoughts or even actions?

232
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,540
 I realized, at least for me, I can't speak for them, is that one thing, it was caused

233
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,940
 by low self-esteem and the idea that I can't really make any changes, nothing I do.

234
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,460
 I mean, for one thing, nothing I do is good enough, and the other thing is I can't really

235
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,900
 do anything to change what's happening.

236
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,300
 And I realized, I mean, these things are actually more common than I know.

237
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,180
 I mean, many people also suffer from this.

238
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:47,780
 And so when I think even in a deeper sense, I mean, where did all these things come from?

239
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:54,620
 And when I go deeper into it, I realize, well, it's actually the belittling that I have experienced,

240
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,780
 and I realized that when I was younger, when I made mistakes, I would be often told that,

241
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:04,140
 "Oh, you're stupid, and you can't even do anything right."

242
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:12,100
 And so these voices from actually my parents would continue to repeat in my mind as well.

243
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:18,900
 And so I would have very low self-esteem, and my family's not big on praising or affirmation,

244
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,100
 and may easily compare me with other people as well.

245
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,980
 And because the other thing that really caused it, I think, is the idea, I mean, is the fact

246
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,260
 that my dad also passed away when I was really young, even though I've prayed hard for him

247
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,780
 not to be.

248
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:45,500
 And so I think this all like hopelessness and the hopeness, continued to be in my life,

249
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,900
 and I realized if I had never looked into it, it would affect me.

250
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,340
 Now, when I say all these things, I don't want to say like, "Parents are bad," and I

251
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,300
 don't want to say, "My parents are bad," because I love them, and they're so good to me.

252
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,660
 But what I do want to say is we are imperfect people, and there are things that we don't

253
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,460
 know are sinful that we continue to do.

254
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:18,380
 And so really it is my prayer and also my hope that all of us, because of our brokenness,

255
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:24,740
 somewhere along the line, there is something that is still hindering us.

256
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:32,600
 And today I'm sharing that, I guess, quite out loudly, because I feel like someone is

257
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,220
 also suffering from these things or other similar things, and I don't want us to overlook

258
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,220
 that.

259
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:48,060
 And so, I mean, after all this, I suppose the question really is, I mean, how, or how

260
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:56,820
 do we overcome these pasts that we've just talked about, we've established where they

261
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,660
 possibly might be coming from?

262
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:05,980
 And the Bible actually tells us in John 3, 7 that we are to be born again.

263
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,460
 Of course, born again has different meanings in the context.

264
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,240
 I mean, one of those is that we need to be radically new.

265
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,260
 We need to be make anew into a different person.

266
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:23,900
 One that is not only from our generational past, but one that's absolutely new from the

267
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,580
 Word of God.

268
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:33,860
 And so we become this new creation stated also in 2 Corinthians 5, 17, that the old

269
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,020
 is gone and we're this new creation.

270
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:39,380
 And so how do we actually achieve that?

271
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:44,540
 Well, the first thing that I want to share with you is to identify and connect.

272
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,900
 I mean, looking for that pattern.

273
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,420
 I mean, what has been happening in your life?

274
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,300
 Have you continued to see patterns of failure in the same area?

275
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,140
 Or have you noticed that you've been depressed over the same things?

276
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,300
 What are they?

277
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,820
 And not only do you look within your life for that pattern, what about generational

278
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,820
 patterns?

279
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,600
 Do you see anything that's happening?

280
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,060
 Maybe you had parents that were single parent and you're at the verge of thinking about

281
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:21,900
 divorce or maybe you had people that continue to belittle you and you find that you're belittling

282
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,460
 other people around you.

283
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,900
 I mean, what is it?

284
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,980
 Is there a pattern that you're seeing?

285
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,940
 So first identify it.

286
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,340
 And we can do that by drawing out a genogram.

287
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,260
 In a moment we'll show you kind of what that looks like, but we won't actually go through

288
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,260
 it.

289
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,340
 But to give you a sense of what it is.

290
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,940
 Or we can talk to someone.

291
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,580
 Talk to someone that really knows you.

292
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,580
 Because you know what?

293
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:53,340
 Your blind spot and my blind spot isn't so minimal to other people.

294
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,740
 It's very obvious to other people.

295
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,660
 And they can definitely tell us where it is that we are repeating those patterns.

296
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,100
 And also we can connect to the past.

297
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,420
 What that means is we need to find out where the root of the problem is.

298
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:16,180
 I mean, even if I know that, oh, I'm suffering from low self-image or I'm suffering from

299
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,140
 a certain kind of addiction, but where is it coming from?

300
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,740
 That's also very important.

301
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:28,420
 So for us to connect the dots and then we can have a chance for Christ to help us, to

302
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,100
 liberate us.

303
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,300
 And the third thing really is to accept it.

304
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:38,300
 Because you know, many a times after finding out what it is, even connecting to the root,

305
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,820
 there might be a part of us that wants to reject it and say, "No, you know what?

306
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,060
 I am not a narcissist.

307
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,460
 What are you talking about?

308
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,180
 I'm not selfish."

309
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,680
 And so sometimes we might just don't want to accept it.

310
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,140
 And so the very first part for us is to do that.

311
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,260
 And so we're going to show you what a genogram looks like.

312
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,420
 And there are lots more information where you can go online, Google it, and see how

313
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,820
 you can do it, maybe with a few friends or with your clans in your small group.

314
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,040
 And you can definitely find out to see those patterns.

315
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,980
 And so the next one I want to show you is how do we identify them?

316
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:21,740
 So I have a list here of things that you can identify for yourself and also for your family

317
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,940
 together, maybe you can do it with your family.

318
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,820
 I mean, has there been lying going on, cheating?

319
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,220
 I mean, every now and then I found that, you know, I might be, I'm not cheating, cheating,

320
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,700
 but there was one time I didn't bring my app.

321
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,140
 And so I can't do the leave home safe.

322
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,820
 And I wanted to go in from the back door, that kind of thing.

323
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,820
 So are there any suicidal thoughts or divorce or jealousy?

324
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,100
 I mean, do you see yourself comparing to someone all the time?

325
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,300
 And do you have low self-esteem?

326
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,900
 Are you arrogant or anxious all the time?

327
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,900
 Are you depressed?

328
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,220
 Do you have bipolar?

329
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,140
 Are you obsessed with certain things?

330
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:07,140
 I mean, sometimes it can be things that are a lot lighter, like being impatient is also

331
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:14,260
 a characteristic that isn't so great, or lazy, narcissists, being selfish, or it might be

332
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:19,740
 that you're very, you know, you can give up very easily when hardship comes.

333
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,540
 Or you find yourself blaming other people instead of taking responsibility.

334
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,660
 Or there might be a sickness that's being passed on.

335
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,260
 And there's something that you can do about it.

336
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:36,540
 Or not being content, or have addictions, or belittling, being abusive, comparing, or

337
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
 irresponsible.

338
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:43,260
 Now, this definitely isn't a full list, but it's a good list to start.

339
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,780
 And I also came up with a list that, you know, we can start to connect the dots.

340
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,340
 I mean, where did it come from?

341
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,500
 I mean, did we have overprotective families?

342
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,820
 Did we have a family where there were verbal or physical abuse?

343
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,060
 Or maybe you were never complimented by your parents.

344
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:07,540
 Maybe you were always compared to, or had divorced parents, or substance addiction,

345
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,020
 or there's some sort of love for money.

346
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:16,220
 And it could be because it came from a time when your family went through poverty.

347
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,220
 And it can be a role model of just seeing who they are, and you've kind of copied that

348
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,220
 yourself.

349
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,540
 And there's belittling, or there's loss of loved ones.

350
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:31,860
 And that's really scarring you and making you insecure or scared to love again.

351
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,380
 Or have you been bullied, rather, at school, at home?

352
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,380
 Are there sickness?

353
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,420
 Or maybe you were raised up by a helper instead of your parents.

354
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,260
 And maybe you didn't have much discipline.

355
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,340
 Or maybe the other way, you had too much discipline.

356
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,900
 And their family habits or traumatic experiences.

357
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:54,220
 Or you might even have a disabled sibling.

358
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:01,860
 And that can cause all sorts of emotional unhealthy states.

359
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,660
 So I mean, again, this is a list, really, for us to start.

360
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,900
 Because I don't want this sermon-- I want this sermon to be a really practical one,

361
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,340
 where after we hear about it, we really begin to think what those things are.

362
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,500
 And the second thing that I really want to say is that we need to own it.

363
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,980
 Because it's easy for us to kind of shift blame and just say, well, you know, I'm like

364
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,100
 this because my parents were saying, well, my grandma was like that, my grandpa.

365
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,140
 And so the situation's like this.

366
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,780
 And whenever we blame or shift the responsibility, you know what that is?

367
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,180
 It means that we don't need to do anything about it.

368
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,580
 And the only time that we'll do something about it is if we own it and say, you know

369
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,580
 what?

370
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,580
 This has happened.

371
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:50,220
 My parents didn't know, neither did my parents' parents.

372
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,420
 And you know what?

373
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,020
 It's going to stop here right now at my generation.

374
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,280
 And I'm determined to do that.

375
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,020
 And if we have this kind of determination, and we can go to God and say, God, help us.

376
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:09,180
 I see this passing on, this sin or this ungodly character, this stronghold.

377
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,900
 And I want it to stop now.

378
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
 And that's where it's going to work.

379
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,060
 Because we are taking ownership.

380
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,460
 We're doing something about it.

381
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,160
 We're going to God with it.

382
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,500
 And the last one is that we need to relearn.

383
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:29,340
 Now there's a Cantonese phrase, not phrase, word that I really like, which is "ticking,

384
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,340
 ticking."

385
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,060
 Okay, you're borrowing the mirror.

386
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,100
 I don't know how to translate this.

387
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,620
 So really, it's like we're learning from what other people did that didn't work.

388
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,180
 So if you're seeing your parents were doing this or your grandma, and that didn't work

389
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,420
 out well, well, you know what?

390
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,060
 Let's borrow the mirror, which means let's learn from them.

391
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,220
 We don't have to walk into a ditch before we know it's dark and cold, right?

392
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
 We can just see it.

393
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,440
 Oh, that's not, that's dark and cold.

394
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,040
 Let me do something else.

395
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:08,100
 And so the idea is to learn, relearn something that we find that is crucial.

396
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:12,580
 And the next thing is, we have talked about this before, which is don't do it alone.

397
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:18,140
 You know, we have plans here where it's a safe place for you to really do this together,

398
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,300
 to find out what it is and to support one another.

399
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:26,340
 And I'm so thankful that I got to speak with the people at the Wellbeing Champions that

400
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,980
 were hosted by Christina and Charlotte last year.

401
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,460
 And a whole bunch of us went through the training.

402
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,280
 And they've volunteered, many of them saying that they would be glad that they would be

403
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,940
 our first touch points.

404
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,380
 But this is something that's on your heart.

405
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,020
 You want to talk about it first with us.

406
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,340
 And again, I mean, we're not trained professionals, but we're trained to listen.

407
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,020
 We're trained to point you in the right direction.

408
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,580
 So if that's you, please don't hesitate.

409
00:28:55,580 --> 00:29:02,460
 And I want to say you can call us, but there's an email here, kfci@kongfeng.org.

410
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,620
 And we really just want to be your first point of touch point.

411
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,620
 Yeah.

412
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,580
 And also let your community reparent you.

413
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,580
 What does that mean?

414
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:18,420
 Reparenting means maybe you had some really harsh parents and they've never complimented

415
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,420
 you.

416
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,420
 But you know what?

417
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,420
 Let your community be that group of people where they can compliment you.

418
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,420
 They can cheer you on.

419
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:32,420
 They can praise you for the little things or the big achievements that you've done in

420
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,980
 your life.

421
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:43,100
 And also maybe you had parents that were abusive or other parents that didn't know how to support

422
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,940
 you and listen to you.

423
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:50,700
 Well, this community, we will learn together how that works.

424
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,620
 I mean, we can learn to listen to you and you can learn to listen to other people as

425
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
 well.

426
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,900
 So as a community, we can reparent each other.

427
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,660
 Whatever it is that we didn't know and we didn't get a chance to experience, we can

428
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,060
 do that.

429
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:14,540
 And so you see, I really just want to kind of wrap up with Genesis 50.

430
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:24,940
 This is actually after all the lying and cheating and deceiving and Joseph, which is the second

431
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,700
 youngest son of Jacob.

432
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,740
 He was sold into slavery and yet he became the second in command.

433
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:38,620
 And he was the one that helped a lot of people because he was the one that stored the grain

434
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,060
 during the famine where everybody could be fed.

435
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,340
 And so this is what he said at the end in the hindsight.

436
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,940
 He said, "You intended to harm me."

437
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:53,660
 And when he said you, he meant the brothers intended to harm me.

438
00:30:53,660 --> 00:31:01,100
 But God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many

439
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,100
 lives.

440
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:10,260
 And so I just wanted to kind of end with that note where God can take whatever your family

441
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:18,220
 origin sins or passed down sins or ungodly character or strongholds and he can redeem

442
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,220
 it.

443
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:26,100
 And when he redeems it, it's not only for you, but for the blessings of other people.

444
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:36,260
 And I believe that personally, I had also had that privilege to be reparent by God himself.

445
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:44,540
 And in Christ, he has the power to break every chain and every sin or strongholds that we

446
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,540
 have.

447
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:50,260
 It's not just our generational, rather it's our experiences of pain or loss.

448
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,540
 And he is able to do that.

449
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:59,020
 And I want to say now that when I make a mistake, instead of feeling like I'm stupid and I can't

450
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,140
 do anything right, I'll be like, "Okay, that's a mistake.

451
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,500
 What can I learn from it?

452
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,900
 I'll do a better job next time."

453
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:09,260
 And I have the confidence that God's going to be with me.

454
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,080
 He's going to help me to make those changes.

455
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,380
 And instead of being scared that anything that I do is not going to have an effect in

456
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,220
 the future, it won't change, I don't have that thought anymore.

457
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:31,340
 I know that if I go to God with my situation, he will always help me in a way that is God-glorifying.

458
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:37,900
 And I believe that he has redeemed me and that from this generation, from my generation,

459
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:44,020
 that there will be at least cut from my family any suicidal thoughts.

460
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:51,540
 And so I really see God being that redeemer and he is here not only for me and many other

461
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:55,120
 people, but he is here for you.

462
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:03,200
 So let us just really soak in how God's redeeming power can really break every chain and that

463
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,400
 he is here to break the power of the past for you.

464
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,520
 So let us pray together.

465
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:16,560
 Dear Heavenly Father, we just want to thank you for your redemptive power, that it was

466
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:24,720
 because of what was done on the cross, that we are redeemed people, that no matter what

467
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:33,880
 Satan, what evil spirits have desires for us to devour us, to kill and destroy and to

468
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:40,080
 steal, that his plans will never prevail because you are here in our lives.

469
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,640
 And we pray, Father, that you continue to help us to break every single chain, break

470
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:54,600
 every single sin that has been long going in our generations before us to stop because

471
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
 of you.

472
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,280
 And Father, we thank you for your redemptive power and your loving grace for us.

473
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray.

474
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,780
 Amen.

475
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:13,780
