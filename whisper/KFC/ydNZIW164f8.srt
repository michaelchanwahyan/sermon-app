1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Good evening everyone, good to see you all.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 There's a lot of things that have been happening full stop in the world.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Christina and I and our family have been in Hong Kong for four and a half years now,

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 and it's just been non-stop change anyway.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 But I can speak to you honestly about this.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I don't know if it's something that we're going to be able to do.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I don't know if it's something that we really, really wanted to do.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 But there's one thing that has been driving Christina and I and our hearts throughout all of our time.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 The reason why we came to Hong Kong actually was to pursue God's heart.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 At that time we didn't know that there was going to be something called the protest.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We'd never been in one ourselves.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I didn't know what an extradition bill was.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I didn't know what LegCo was.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 I just spelt Lego wrong.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 So I didn't know what COVID was.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 I didn't know what starting a church really meant.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 And I can tell you honestly now,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I've spoken very openly with some fellow leaders in this church as we've been talking and praying about this,

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 is quite frankly I don't know what I'm doing.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But I know exactly what I'm doing.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I know that doesn't make sense.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 But that's been my life.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 So welcome to my life.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 But part of that is just going, actually God, what is your heart?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 What is it that you want we as your church to know during this time?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 It's a tumultuous time across the world.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 The church is changing itself.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 The young people are leaving our churches.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And actually we don't really know what to do.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 And I'm here to say, look, neither do I.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 But I know that God has a heart for them.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 And I know God has a heart to reach them.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 The mission and organization that I'm still going to be part of is Young Life.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And the motto is how do we go to where the young people are at?

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And how do we earn the right to be heard?

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 How do we not just be a church service?

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I know some of us are visitors here and welcome.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And this may be your first time, but I hope it's not your last.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 But I also want you to know that this isn't just a service that we're running.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Because if it was just a service that you wanted,

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 there's plenty of places that you can go just to find a service.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 In fact, there's a service that you can attend at home.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 As long as you type in youtube.com,

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 you'll be able to find some sermons that are much better than what I'm about to share.

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But that's not really the point.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I don't think that's the heart of God.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 As I look at the scriptures, as I look at this, I think there's more to it.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Because if it was just a lesson that we needed to learn,

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 I don't know if Jesus needed to come back to do it.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 If it was just a set of doctrine we needed to memorize,

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I don't think we needed the Holy Spirit.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 And I don't think it would have caught fire to the point where it outlived the Roman Empire.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 There's something more than just a service, a lecture.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 The original word for church is ecclesia, is gathering, and it's an assembly.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 It's a body of people who are all confronted by the same thing.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 And I wanted to share today, we've been going through the heart of Jesus in this series.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And we started, Johnny was talking about the heart, the touches.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 That Jesus goes beside the broken, the lepers even, and he's willing to touch them.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 He's willing to heal them.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 He's willing to stand beside the broken and be filled with compassion.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And he's also the one who's looking for faith.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And I shared about this, about the centurion.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 He's looking for people who are willing to put their complete faith in him.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 2 Chronicles 16, 9, the Lord is just going to and through the earth,

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 looking for people whose hearts are blameless, and he will strengthen them.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 John 4, Jesus is talking to this woman at the well, and he's saying,

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 "The Father is looking for those who will worship him in spirit and in truth."

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 He's looking for these people.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 And last week, Michelle talked about, actually, he has a heart to accept.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Those people who are broken, those people who are sinners, he welcomes them in.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And we as a church, who are also welcomed by him, are then supposed to welcome other people.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Today, the title of the talk is "A Heart That Confronts."

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 A heart that confronts.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Confront, we often use--we think about in an almost negative way.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 It's someone, when Kelly's done something wrong,

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 then I'm going to figure out how I'm going to confront you.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 But really, confront is just, actually, I want to bring this situation to the forefront,

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 and I'm going to talk about it with you face-to-face.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 That's what confront means.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Who's done the Enneagram test before?

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Some people have done the--oh, not really many.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Enneagram test--Charles, good to see you.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 What Enneagram are you? Do you know?

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Do you remember?

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 So there's different--there's nine.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 There's different personality traits.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Of course, with some of these tests, it's kind of like you are who you say you are.

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 As you're answering them, "Oh, do you like hosting parties?"

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 "Yeah." "Are you a friendly person?" "Oh, sure I am."

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 You answer the questions.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 Of course, some people will answer them properly.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Anyway, the whole point is that there's nine characteristics,

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 nine personalities that we kind of generally fit into, kind of.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And one of them is Enneagram 8.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 It is the challenger.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 You had people in your life who liked to challenge.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 You say something, you're like, "No, I don't agree with that."

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 People in your workplace, when you're in a meeting, you have ideas.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Next to the challenger, number 8, is number 9, and he's the peacemaker.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Well, she's the peacemaker.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 She's like, "Everyone, just--everyone, just--it's all okay.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Let's just agree."

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And then the challenger will go, "Well, I don't agree that we should just agree.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I think we should agree to disagree, and I think we should talk about it,

105
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 and I think we should spend a lot of time debating about this

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 because that's how we'll get better."

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 And they're not wrong, but sometimes they can come across as jerks.

108
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 But actually, the heart of it is actually--there's actually good things.

109
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 So we think about being confronted, and I realized this.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 And as I was preparing this message, I realized that Jesus is a confronter.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Jesus, kind and compassionate, with his blonde hair and blue eyes,

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 floating because he doesn't have feet, and he just floats and loves on people

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 and heals everything that he touches, is not quite the Jesus of the Bible.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Jesus confronts.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Jesus goes to people where they're at, earns the right to be heard,

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 and then speaks into that and confronts them.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 You see in John 2, he's just starting his ministry.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 He's just been to a wedding, and he's had a great time.

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 He wants to just chill with his friends.

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Mom says, "Hey, there's a problem with the wine.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 Can you deal with it, and can you sort it?"

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And then he says, "Mom, I don't really want to.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 It's not really time. Can I do it later?"

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And then Mom just says, "No. Do it."

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And then he does it.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 And then he goes to the temple, and he sees all these people

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 who are completely using the temple for the wrong reason.

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 They're supposed to be there to worship God,

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 and yet they've turned it into this currency exchange place

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 where they're selling goats and lambs and everything

131
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 for convenience and for profit, and then he just loses it.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 So you see this kind, compassionate, gentle Jesus suddenly completely turn

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 because it touches a nerve.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 What is that nerve? What is it, the thing that he cares about the most?

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Luke 4, verse 44, he says this.

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 "This was the reason I came. For this reason I was sent."

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 What was that reason?

138
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 "I must preach the good news to the other towns as well."

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 I think that's what he confronts us with.

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 He confronts us with the good news.

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 He confronts us with the gospel.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 The problem here is this.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 I know this for sure.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 I think there are people in this room here with us

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 who have not been confronted with the gospel.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Have a think now what that even means for you.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 Well, let's just dial it back a bit if it's your first time

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 and I'm not trying to freak you out here.

149
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 What is the gospel?

150
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 The gospel is just good news.

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 And Kelly shared about this so eloquently as she was leading.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 The good news is that someone paid the price.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 The cross was supposed to be ours.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 The death was supposed to be ours, but someone came in and said,

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 "I've got it. Put it on my tab."

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 That's the gospel.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 But here's the problem.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 I think there's people here who haven't been confronted

159
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 with the gospel and I'll tell you why.

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 Because before you are able to accept and embrace

161
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 and welcome this good news, you first have to realize

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 that there is bad news.

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Otherwise, the good news means nothing.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Does that make sense?

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 So we need to know what that bad news is.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 I was just having a breakfast with a dear friend

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 who's just been on the journey of the faith

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 and he's just trying to figure things out.

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And he says, "You know what, James?

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 You know what's happened?

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 I'm losing my hope in humanity as I find out more

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 about the faith."

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And I was like, "Whoa. Tell me more."

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 He said, "Well, before I found out about this stuff,

175
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I was kind of like, 'Hey, I'm just a good person.

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Considering starting a family, you know, bring a good person

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 into this world and we'll just kind of do good things.

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 We're kind of good people.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 Pay all our taxes and don't push old ladies.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 We're okay. We're good.'

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 But as I find out more about the gospel,

182
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 as I'm seeing the world as it is,

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I'm getting more and more discouraged

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 because this world's not a good place.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 There's darkness.

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 It's not as good as I thought it was."

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 And I was like--well, one part, I was like, "Oh, man.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 My sermons are not helping you at all.

189
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 This is going the wrong way."

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 But then I realized, actually, no, it's going the right way

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 because in order for us to be confronted with the gospel,

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
 the good news, we first have to understand

193
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 what the bad news is.

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 In order for us to feel overjoyed that, man,

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 someone came to save us,

196
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 someone came to pay the whole thing for us,

197
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 we first have to understand that we're in debt,

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 that we're drowning.

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 And so he's starting to get it.

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 He's like, "You know what else there is?

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 The world is a dark place, but I've started noticing

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 that I'm a bad person."

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 And it made me think of the Tim Keller quote.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 What is the good news?

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 It is that I'm far worse than I imagined,

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 but far more loved than I ever dare dream.

207
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 As I encounter the gospel,

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 as I look at the Jesus of the Bible,

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 I start to see, man, he's confronting me

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 with something that's very interesting,

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 with bad news, that actually I thought I was doing well,

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 I thought I was a good person.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 But as I search more, I realize that actually

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 I'm not so good at all, and that's bad news.

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 And I fall short of the glory of God,

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 and I am not holy because we're told to be holy,

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 but I'm not.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 But there is good news.

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 He saved us.

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Ephesians 2 talked about this.

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 He's saying, actually, you were dead in your trespasses and sins.

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 You were following the course of this world.

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 You were following the prince and the power of the air.

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 You were satisfying all the desires of your flesh.

225
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 That's us.

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 He carries on later.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 He says, you remember at one time,

228
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 you were lost without hope.

229
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 You were strangers to the promise.

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 You were separated from Christ.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 But then the biggest two words that you can see in Ephesians 2,

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 I think, is, but God.

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 But God, rich in mercy,

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 because of the great love that he had for us,

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 made us alive together.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 That's the good news.

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 And it's interesting, because as we look at the scripture

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 that we have today, my question for you is,

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 have you been confronted with that good news?

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Have you been confronted with that gospel?

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 As we think about what this gathering, KFCI gathering,

242
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 looks like, I look at Acts 2.

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 I look at the energy that they had,

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 that there were people just coming in filled with just joy

245
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 and power and living in a way that was completely supernatural

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 and different to the way of the world.

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 What was the key?

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 What was the recipe?

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 The gospel.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 The good news.

251
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And they were cut to the heart, Acts 2.37.

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 They were cut to the heart.

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 My question to you, brothers and sisters, today is,

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 have you ever been cut to the heart?

255
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Because if you haven't, then maybe we're still waiting

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 for that moment for the Lord to confront you.

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 But don't be afraid.

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 It doesn't end on bad news.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 The point of the gospel is that it will cut us to the heart,

260
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 but then it will fill us with a joy and an aura and wonder

261
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 that will completely change everything.

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 There was a sinner.

263
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 There was a woman.

264
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 She tried relationships lots of times, five times, in fact,

265
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 and she'd married five times, and finally she gave up on that.

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 And then so she started just living with the sixth man,

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 and then she gets confronted by Jesus.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 This story is in John 4.

269
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 No one likes her.

270
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 The whole of the town avoids her, and she avoids them

271
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 because of the shame.

272
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 The women would go to get the water in the morning or at night

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 because it's simply too hot.

274
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 It's kind of like this weather.

275
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 You're not supposed to be walking outside around noon,

276
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 but she's going to get water at noon.

277
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 Why?

278
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Because she's avoiding people.

279
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And yet, little did she know that she gets confronted

280
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 by a man, but not just any man.

281
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 And this confrontation that he calls her out on

282
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 doesn't lead to shame, doesn't lead to embarrassment,

283
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 doesn't completely just break her, and she's in tears,

284
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 and she just wants to hide in a hole.

285
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 She doesn't do that.

286
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 What does she do?

287
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 I'll tell the long story short.

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 Jesus says, "Hey, go and find your husband."

289
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 And she's like, "I don't have a husband."

290
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 And then he's like, "I know.

291
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 And the one you're living with isn't your husband,

292
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 but you've been married five times, so you've been trying hard at this."

293
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 And then they have this long conversation,

294
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 and he talks to her about how actually there will be a moment

295
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 where she will be able to worship in spirit and in truth,

296
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 and that moment is now.

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 She is confronted with the gospel, and what happens?

298
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 She can't wait and run back into the town and say,

299
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 "Everyone, everyone, everyone, you know how bad I am,

300
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 but there's a man who knew all of that and told me everything

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 that I've ever done, but I feel no shame.

302
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 Come and see.

303
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 Come and find him."

304
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 I'll tell you what confrontation leads to.

305
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 Confrontation leads to transformation.

306
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 If you haven't felt that cut to the heart,

307
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 maybe you've not been confronted,

308
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 and maybe that's why you have not transformed yet.

309
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 Maybe that's why you're still struggling with the same things

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 that you're struggling with.

311
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Maybe that's why you're actually not filled with the joy of living,

312
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 the Christian living, which is basically knowing that God is real,

313
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 that He's here with you, and that He loves you,

314
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 but maybe you need to be cut to the heart and undone by the gospel,

315
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 and you'll be able to experience that.

316
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 We see a very interesting thing that happens here.

317
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Luke 7.

318
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Charlotte, I'm going to try my best to read out the verses

319
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 as quick as possible so you can find it, okay?

320
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 But the next one isn't on there.

321
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Luke 7, just to set the context, Jesus' ministry is gaining steam.

322
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 It says 17--actually, I will read the 17 first.

323
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 Luke 7, verse 17, it's not on the slides.

324
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 It says, "And this report about him spread throughout the whole of Judea

325
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 and all the surrounding country."

326
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 So Jesus is doing stuff and it's starting to spread.

327
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 People are hearing about this.

328
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 He opened his thread up, and everyone's following him.

329
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 They're trying to figure out what he's trying to do,

330
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 relating to the young people.

331
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Paul's laughing, he knows.

332
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And so what happens next is this.

333
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Now, you know that his archrival are the Pharisees.

334
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 I like to call these the professional Christians.

335
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Actually, what breaks my heart is I think there are a lot

336
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 of professional Christians in Hong Kong, even in our churches.

337
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 People who have said, "Oh, we're going to do this,"

338
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 but then it ends up just being for a living,

339
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 ends up just to run a corporation, a business, a ministry.

340
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 We put the programs over the people, and we lose the heart

341
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 of what we're actually trying to do.

342
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 But anyway, so there's this professional Christian, Pharisee.

343
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 Him and his boys are hearing about all this stuff.

344
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 And admittedly, to be honest, I actually think they get a bad rep

345
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 because if I was that person at that moment as a professional

346
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 Christian in the town, Pharisees were rich people

347
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 who were also religious rulers.

348
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 But who is this guy?

349
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Why is he causing all this kerfuffle?

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 Why are all these people following him?

351
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And why are they all completely transformed?

352
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Even the sinners are completely turning around.

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 So he does the next thing, which I think is pretty brave of him.

354
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 [speaking in foreign language]

355
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Bring him in and bring him to the house and have a meal.

356
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 But he tries to confront Jesus, and he does it with his boys.

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 So he welcomes them into his home, and they sit around,

358
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 and that's the context of what he's trying to do.

359
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And we find out more about that.

360
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 So you have this Pharisee, and this story here,

361
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 this passage here is really about three people.

362
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 It's about Jesus, it's about the professional Christian,

363
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 and it's about the professional sinner.

364
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 This is the beginning of a really funny joke that I haven't written.

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 What happens when Jesus, a professional Christian,

366
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 and a professional sinner have dinner together?

367
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 We find out what happens exactly.

368
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 So here we go, and I'm going to start reading some of it for you.

369
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 Luke 7, verse 37, let's go, 36.

370
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him,

371
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 and he went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.

372
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 So this isn't him being an adolescent.

373
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 This is how they sat when they had dinner.

374
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 So they wouldn't be sitting upright.

375
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 They would have these long chaise longs that they sit on,

376
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 and they'd sit like this, and they would tuck their feet around the back.

377
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 You'd just lean on your left elbow while you're picking off food.

378
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 That's what he does.

379
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 So Jesus sits down, and this is the custom.

380
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 He sits down, and he reclines at the table, and he starts eating.

381
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 But then the problem appears.

382
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Verse 37, "And behold, a woman of the city who was a sinner,

383
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house,

384
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 brought an alabaster flask of ointment."

385
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Let's stop there.

386
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 So this woman, a woman of the city, a sinner,

387
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 most commentators think that this was used to describe a prostitute.

388
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 So this woman hears about Jesus having dinner at this Pharisee's house.

389
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Now, what was also the custom was, as you invite someone to dinner,

390
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 you'll have people around the table, but actually the doors were open

391
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 for anyone to come and stand on the walls around the outside to listen in,

392
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 just to see what's going on.

393
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 There's going to be drama.

394
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 There's going to be a battle.

395
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 There's going to be a rap battle, and we're going to see if the Pharisee

396
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 will beat Jesus.

397
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 And so the doors are open.

398
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 So this woman hears about this, and then she comes in and joins.

399
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 Now, likely, people think, "There's no way, actual way of knowing here is,"

400
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 there's likely, she's probably been confronted with the gospel herself previously.

401
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 She's probably met Jesus, heard his teachings from before.

402
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 So she's very keen and eager, desperate, desperate to go in.

403
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 A woman of the city, a sinner, goes in to this Pharisee's home.

404
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 She's got to be desperate because people would frown upon her coming into this.

405
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
 But she's like, "I don't care.

406
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 What I just heard him say out there the other day, something--I need to go see him.

407
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 I need to go see him, and I need to go and talk to him, so I'm going to go find him."

408
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And so basically she sneaks in, and she stands right behind where he's reclining.

409
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And then, and she has an alabaster flask of ointment.

410
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 Often people, women like that, would hang the alabaster jar,

411
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 which is about this size, and it's got a really narrow neck,

412
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 and she would hang it around her neck.

413
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And of course, in the ointment there, a very expensive ointment,

414
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 would give off a perfume that is very attractive and very nice.

415
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 And so she sneaks in behind Jesus, and she stands there,

416
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 hoping to hear about it, hear about what he's got to say.

417
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 In verse 38, "And standing behind him at his feet, weeping,

418
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head,

419
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment."

420
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 Okay, this is as weird as it sounds.

421
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 And it was as weird back then as it would be right now.

422
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Okay, so there's no context here that you need to know.

423
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 This is strange, okay?

424
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 This woman goes in, she wants to talk to Jesus, I imagine, that's only my guess.

425
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 The scripture doesn't say any more.

426
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 I can imagine she's broken through, she's plucked up the courage to go in,

427
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
 and she just wants to talk to him.

428
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 There's just something that she needs--she knows something needs to be done.

429
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 And so she stands there, hoping maybe just to stand behind,

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 just listening on the conversation, but here's what happens.

431
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 When we are confronted with the gospel, sometimes,

432
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 especially when it's the source of the gospel, the creator himself,

433
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 I can totally imagine this.

434
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 This has happened to me before.

435
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 She's just completely undone.

436
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 I think we know what that feeling is like, maybe when we're near a loved one.

437
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Maybe when we're so broken and desperate, and there's just someone

438
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 that is very important to us, and we're just next to them,

439
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 and you just can't control your emotions anymore.

440
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 That's my feeling of what she's doing.

441
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 She wants to try and engage, but then she just can't.

442
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 She's just crying.

443
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And it's embarrassing now because she's just weeping,

444
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 and the tears are dripping onto his feet.

445
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 He's reclining back like this, right?

446
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 And so he's dropping onto his feet, and then she's like,

447
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 "I don't know what to do. I can't wipe it."

448
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 So the only thing that she can do is to loosen her hair.

449
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 I mean, it's funny that I'm doing this right now, but--

450
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 [laughter]

451
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 It's been a long time since I know what that feels like.

452
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
 George, come here.

453
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 I see you, Charles. Nice and bright.

454
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 We've got to-- Bold and courageous, that's what we are.

455
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 So she-- And then she lets--

456
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Now, I need to tell you again how scandalous that is,

457
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 because women aren't supposed to do that.

458
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 You can get arrested for that.

459
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 So she does it anyway, because it might be the only thing

460
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 that she has to wipe his feet.

461
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 So she just unties it, and then she just uses--

462
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 "Oh, my goodness, I'm freaking out now,

463
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 because I'm next to Jesus, and now I'm crying,

464
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 and now I'm-- Ah!"

465
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 "Just wipe it, wipe it."

466
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 That's the scene, okay?

467
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 And here's the funny thing.

468
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 Verse 39.

469
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 "Simon, the Pharisee, the professional Christian.

470
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this,

471
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 he said to himself, 'Simon thinks, not Simon says.'"

472
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Simon thinks, and there's an irony in this

473
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 that is just beautiful.

474
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 "Simon thinks to himself, 'If this man were a prophet,

475
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 he would have known who and what sort of woman this is

476
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 who is touching him, for she is a sinner.'"

477
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 You can imagine this, right?

478
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 He's going, "Man, I thought I was going to confront him,

479
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 and I thought we were going to have a battle,

480
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 but this guy can't even tell who she is.

481
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 He's thinking this."

482
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And in this strange moment of irony,

483
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Jesus knows what he's thinking and replies to him.

484
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 He's not said a word.

485
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 He's just thinking about this,

486
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 and yet Jesus, proving that he's actually not even just a prophet,

487
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 he then goes, "Simon, Simon, I have something to say to you."

488
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Tim Keller often jokes about this.

489
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 If you read Jesus saying-- If Jesus says to you,

490
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 "Hey, I have something to say to you,"

491
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 you should be worried.

492
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 You should be very, very worried.

493
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 And so Jesus replies his thought,

494
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 and he answers, "Say it, teacher."

495
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 And then here is the moment where Jesus confronts him.

496
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 At this point, he's not done anything.

497
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 He's just come in. He's just reclining. He's eating.

498
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 He knows what this is about,

499
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 but he's just kind of going along with it.

500
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 Of course, the very sad woman is behind him

501
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 just weeping and causing a scene.

502
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And then he tells him a parable, which is what Jesus often does.

503
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Verse 41, "A certain moneylender, a creditor, who had two debtors,

504
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 one owed 500 denarii and the other 50.

505
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 When they could not pay, he canceled the debt of both.

506
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 Now which of them will love him more?"

507
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 So he tells him a very simple parable

508
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 because he wants to teach him something.

509
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 He wants to highlight something.

510
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 But maybe let's pause here,

511
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 and let's talk about some differences that we have

512
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 between the professional Christian and the professional sinner.

513
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Let's talk about even the attitude.

514
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Because what we'll find out,

515
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 and I'll go back to the parable later,

516
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 the attitude is very different here.

517
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 The Pharisee invites him in to confront him.

518
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 He wants to challenge him.

519
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 He wants to have an intellectual debate.

520
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 He wants to just go to war with words and with theology

521
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 and with the Old Testament.

522
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 He wants to do that.

523
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 But the professional sinner, the woman,

524
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 has a completely different agenda.

525
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 She's been confronted with the Gospel,

526
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 and she just wants transformation.

527
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 She just needs to be around him.

528
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And it's just completely undone by the Gospel there.

529
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Completely open, completely vulnerable.

530
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 Whereas the Pharisee, actually we find out later,

531
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 he doesn't even invite, he doesn't even do the customs

532
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 that actually Jesus will talk about in a minute.

533
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 Here's the interesting thing.

534
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 She applies the ointment onto him.

535
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 The way to apply the ointment,

536
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 the way to get the ointment out of the jar,

537
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 do you know what you have to do?

538
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Smash it.

539
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 That's the only thing.

540
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 It's a one-time only coupon.

541
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 So she's freaking out.

542
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 She's crying.

543
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 She has to dry his feet with air.

544
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 And then to the point where now it's all over.

545
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Everyone's watching her.

546
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 She's undone.

547
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 She doesn't know what she's doing.

548
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 So she's trying to wipe it.

549
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 She's applying ointment.

550
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 She's kissing it.

551
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
 She's kissing his feet.

552
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 She's just like, "Oh my goodness.

553
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 "I'm face to face with this guy

554
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 "who's just completely just confronted me

555
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 "with this good news,

556
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 "and I just completely can't contain myself."

557
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 Meanwhile, the Pharisee is probably reclining on his couch

558
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 going, "Jesus, let me see how good you are

559
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 "with your intellectual theological chops.

560
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 "I want to know if you're legit.

561
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 "I want to know if you're a prophet.

562
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 "Actually, you clearly don't look like a prophet.

563
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 "You can't even tell what kind of woman this is.

564
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 "I clearly know this kind of woman."

565
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 The attitude is different,

566
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 but I think the biggest difference

567
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 is the awareness is different.

568
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 I had a dinner the other night,

569
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 and got to meet some new people,

570
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 which is always fun for me,

571
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 until they find out what I do.

572
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 So we have a dinner table,

573
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 and I'm sitting around with some friends.

574
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 Someone invited me,

575
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 and there's just all these other people,

576
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 and they go, "Oh, what do you do?"

577
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 "Oh, I'm in private equity."

578
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 I'm like, "Oh, okay.

579
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 "I don't really know what that is."

580
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 "I'm in hedge funds."

581
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 "Oh, okay.

582
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 "Don't know what that is.

583
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 "Okay."

584
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 "I'm in consulting."

585
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I'm like, "Oh, okay."

586
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
 And it just keeps going around,

587
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 and many of them are non-believers,

588
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 and they're just talking,

589
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 and swearing, and drinking.

590
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 And they're like, "Oh, what do you do, James?"

591
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 "I'm a pastor."

592
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 They're like, "Oh, I thought this was

593
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 "like a finance consulting thing."

594
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 I'm like, "Me too, but I don't know.

595
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 "I knew that, but I don't know why I'm here,

596
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 "but I'm just here."

597
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 And anyway, this is the life of a pastor.

598
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 The moment you reveal that,

599
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 you're the party pooper.

600
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 It's like, "Oh, oh, you were swearing."

601
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 I'm like, "Yep, yep, he was swearing.

602
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 "Yep, yep, he's probably going to hell."

603
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 (audience laughing)

604
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 And then, of course, they're like, "Oh."

605
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 And then I'm like, "Okay, so, are you a Christian?"

606
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 "Do you?"

607
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 And then he's like, "Oh, no, no, no, no.

608
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 "I'm a bad person.

609
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 "I don't do that kind of stuff.

610
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 "Yeah, yeah, 'cause yeah, I would never be allowed in."

611
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And then, "Oh, but he is."

612
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And then he looks at me, "You're a Christian, aren't you?"

613
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 And he's like, "Oh, yeah, I grew up in the church.

614
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 "Yeah, yeah, yeah, but now I'm talking to a pastor.

615
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 "I'm a bad Christian."

616
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 (audience laughing)

617
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 That's what he said.

618
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 And, of course, I'm seeing this enough of this.

619
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 I've been a party pooper for quite a number of years now.

620
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 But then, at that moment,

621
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 I really felt something that I needed to say.

622
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 And this was it, actually.

623
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 The person who said that they were a bad person,

624
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 he's probably not wrong.

625
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 But the person who said that they were a bad Christian,

626
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 they're definitely wrong.

627
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 Because there's no such thing as a bad Christian.

628
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 Christians are people who know they're bad

629
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 and know that they were saved.

630
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 There's no such thing as a bad--

631
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 The moment you think there's a bad Christian thing,

632
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 some of you might go, "Oh, yeah, I'm a pretty bad Christian."

633
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 No, you see, it's not good nor bad.

634
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 A Christian is someone who just knows that they were dead

635
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 and that they needed to be saved.

636
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 That's it.

637
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 You can't qualify it with good or bad.

638
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 Or maybe on the other side,

639
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 is maybe you're sitting there going,

640
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 "Hmm, I'm a pretty good Christian."

641
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 There's no such thing as a good Christian.

642
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 The Bible is very clear on this.

643
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 Jesus is very clear on this.

644
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 No one is good.

645
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 None of you are good.

646
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 All of you fall short of the glory of God,

647
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 but all of you are justified freely by His grace as a gift.

648
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 There's no such thing as good and bad Christians.

649
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 So I had a really fun conversation

650
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 explaining what that really meant.

651
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 So I think the Pharisee had this problem.

652
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 He didn't really realize.

653
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 He thought he was a model believer.

654
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Everyone in this town respected him,

655
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 mostly because he had money and influence

656
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 and because he was disciplined somewhat.

657
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 But his awareness was gone.

658
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 Whereas the professional sinner,

659
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 the woman of the city,

660
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 knew exactly her state.

661
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 That's a huge difference.

662
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 The question is, are we blind like Simon

663
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 or are we aware like the woman?

664
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 It's a very important point.

665
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Jesus in Matthew 15 says,

666
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 actually, He's talking to the Pharisees

667
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 and He's saying, "You guys have all these traditions

668
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 "and you're following all these commandments.

669
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 "You worship me with your lips,

670
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 "but your hearts are far from me."

671
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 That's a professional Christian.

672
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 That's someone who says he is Lord,

673
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 but then actually lives a completely different life inside.

674
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 The question for us is, what are we?

675
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Have we been confronted with the gospel?

676
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 And you might be like, "Yeah, you know, you nailed it.

677
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 "I'm a bad person."

678
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 I'm like, "That's okay.

679
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 "That's why this is perfect for you."

680
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Because you need to know that even that woman

681
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 was welcomed in by Jesus.

682
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 Even that woman was accepted.

683
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 And you need to know that there's nothing

684
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 that you've done in your past

685
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 that will stop Him from loving you.

686
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Nothing will separate you from the love of Christ.

687
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 But if you're the other side,

688
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 you're like, "I've been going to church all my life.

689
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 "I've been serving.

690
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 "I've been serving in VBS and BSF and ABC and Alpha.

691
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 "I've done all the courses."

692
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 This message is also for you

693
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 because the question remains,

694
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 you can do all of those things

695
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 but not be cut to the heart,

696
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 not be confronted with the gospel.

697
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 That's the danger.

698
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
 That's what Simon is going through right here

699
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 and he's having a master class on it.

700
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 He thought he was here for an intellectual debate,

701
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 but he thought he was going to confront Jesus,

702
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 but instead Jesus is confronting him.

703
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 Now there is a similarity between the two

704
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 that I want to highlight in this parable.

705
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 He says, "One owed 500 denarii,"

706
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 which is about a year and a half's wage,

707
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 "and the other owed 50."

708
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 That's about two months.

709
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 So one person owed a year and a half

710
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 to two years' worth of wages, which is a lot,

711
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 and then the other just owed a month or two.

712
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 "When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both.

713
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 "Now which of them will love him more?"

714
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 Verse 43, Simon answers,

715
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 "The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt."

716
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 I mean, you can see Simon is still a moron here.

717
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 "Oh, well, I suppose it's that guy."

718
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Well, of course it's that guy

719
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 because he had a whole year or two years' salary forgiven.

720
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 I was just talking to Paul about this.

721
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Paul has three pairs of shoes.

722
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Okay, just three.

723
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 He has a pair of Vans, which he didn't know were Vans

724
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 until I had a discussion with him about it,

725
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 that they were Vans.

726
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 He has a pair of dress shoes.

727
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 I don't know when he uses those dress shoes.

728
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 And a pair of running shoes.

729
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 I definitely don't know when you use those.

730
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 [laughter]

731
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 So Paul has three pairs of shoes.

732
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Pass the Johnny.

733
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 How many pairs of shoes do you have?

734
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 - 20.

735
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 - More than that.

736
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 - More than that.

737
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 - Like 200.

738
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 - 100.

739
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 - You haven't counted.

740
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 Yeah, yeah.

741
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Still learning how to count above 100.

742
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 Three digits.

743
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 That's what he's doing.

744
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 - Look, he's hanging on the ceiling already.

745
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 - They're everywhere.

746
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Imagine Johnny and Paul both had a debt.

747
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 They both owed someone something.

748
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And then basically what they owed was their shoes.

749
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 Paul only has three pairs that he could potentially lose.

750
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 Johnny has 250.

751
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 [laughter]

752
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 Imagine at that moment the creditor both says,

753
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 "Actually, neither of you need to give me your shoes back."

754
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Who's more happy in that moment?

755
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 Who's more happy?

756
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 That's where Simon the Pharisee says,

757
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 "Well, I suppose."

758
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 Well, it's not suppose.

759
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 It's obviously Johnny because sneakers are his life.

760
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 Yeah?

761
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 - Paul will get more.

762
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 - He'll probably go get more, yes.

763
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 That's why we're praying for a wife.

764
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 We need a wife.

765
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 That's what we need.

766
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 [laughter]

767
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 So here's what he's saying.

768
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 He's saying, "But the interesting thing isn't actually Johnny or Paul.

769
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 It isn't the 500 denarii.

770
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 It isn't the 50."

771
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 What he says is this.

772
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 "Neither of them can pay."

773
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 Because actually, legally, do you know what that means?

774
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 They have one similarity.

775
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 They're both going to prison.

776
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 It doesn't matter whether you've done all of this stuff,

777
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 all of this sin,

778
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 or whether you've just done a little, little bit of sin.

779
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 You're both going to prison.

780
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 In the eyes of the law, you are both the same.

781
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 Isn't that interesting?

782
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 It's got nothing to do whether you're a professional Christian

783
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 or you're a professional sinner.

784
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 Both of you owe something, and both of you cannot pay.

785
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 That's the point of the parable.

786
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 It wasn't who sinned more and who lost.

787
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 The point is, you're both the same.

788
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 All of us here in this room,

789
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 whether we've been confronted with the Gospel or not,

790
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 whether we're a Christian or not,

791
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 whether we've been to church for 70 years,

792
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 or this is our first time,

793
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 do you get it?

794
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 We're all in the same boat.

795
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 We're all in need of the Gospel.

796
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 We're all in need of the good news.

797
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 There is absolutely no difference.

798
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 There is no point looking at someone and going, "They're worse."

799
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 This is where I'll finish.

800
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 You and I should have her mindset instead of his,

801
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 but often, those of us who are Christians,

802
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 who have been in the church circles,

803
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 we look down on other people who are different to us,

804
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 who are swearing, who are doing all these other things

805
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 that we just think are judging,

806
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 and we're like, "You know what?

807
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
 Yeah, that's bad."

808
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 Now, of course, there are behaviors that need to be redeemed.

809
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 When you are confronted, your life transforms.

810
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 It changes.

811
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 What does Jesus say when he talks to sinners?

812
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 He said, "Okay, you have been forgiven.

813
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Go and sin no more."

814
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 So there has to be a transformation.

815
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 There has to be a life change.

816
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 But you and I both need to recognize,

817
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 realize that actually we are,

818
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 we could be the blind professional Christian

819
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 unless we're undone by the Gospel,

820
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 unless we've been confronted with the Gospel.

821
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 You see, Jesus here is saying, "I am the creditor.

822
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
 You both owe me different things,

823
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 and I'm saying it doesn't matter."

824
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 And so, verse 48, he finishes here,

825
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 and this is where I'll finish.

826
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 Verse 47 first, actually.

827
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Sorry, Charlotte.

828
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 "Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many,

829
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 are forgiven, for she loved much,

830
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 but he who has forgiven little loves little."

831
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 And he said to her, verse 48, "Your sins are forgiven."

832
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 It's interesting.

833
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 So he started off challenging Jesus,

834
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 going, "Is this guy even a prophet?"

835
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 And Jesus one-ups him, replies to what he's thinking,

836
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 and then shows him that he's not only a prophet,

837
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 but he is God.

838
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 He is the one who has the authority to even forgive.

839
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 Completely blows it out the water.

840
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 And it freaks everyone out.

841
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 They're like, "Oh, we thought we were going to come

842
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 and confront and have an intellectual debate,

843
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 and yet this guy is now forgiving sins."

844
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 But that's exactly what Jesus is.

845
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 That is exactly who he is.

846
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 He's saying, "You both owe me, but I forgive you both.

847
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 The wages of sin is death,

848
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 but I'm going to die as a ransom for many."

849
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 That's what he's saying here.

850
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Jesus knows what he's going to do.

851
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 Jesus knows this good news,

852
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
 this purpose that he was sent for,

853
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 will require a cost.

854
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 Keller talks a lot about this as well.

855
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 He says, "Forgiveness always comes with a price."

856
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Forgiveness is when you're willing to pay

857
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 for the consequences of someone else's sin.

858
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 When we say, "Oh, Christians, we're supposed to forgive

859
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 and forget, just leave it, and it's okay,

860
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 we make mistakes, there's grace."

861
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 No, there's always a price.

862
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 When we choose to forgive someone that's hurt us

863
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 by not hurting them back, we're saying,

864
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 "I'm going to take that on myself."

865
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 The creditor who releases both of these debts,

866
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 what's he doing?

867
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 The debts don't disappear.

868
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 Someone pays.

869
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Who pays?

870
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 The creditor.

871
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 The creditor says, "Okay, you both owe me.

872
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 You owe me three pairs of shoes.

873
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 You owe me 250 pairs of shoes.

874
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 I'm going to let both of those debts go.

875
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
 I'm going to cancel them both.

876
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 Who's paying?

877
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 I'm paying for 253 pairs of shoes."

878
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 That's why Jesus has that authority,

879
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
 because he takes on that sin, and he says,

880
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 "Put it on my tab.

881
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 I'm going to be going to the cross,

882
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 and I'm going to be dealing with all of this

883
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 once and for all."

884
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 That was the purpose why I came.

885
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 These people are living in bad news,

886
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 but I'm here to tell them some good news,

887
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 that I'm going to take the bad news off them,

888
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
 and I'm going to put it all onto me,

889
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
 and so that they can then live with the freedom

890
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 that I can give them, because I have now freed them

891
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 from that debt.

892
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 Brothers and sisters, that's the gospel.

893
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 You know what?

894
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
 This is one of my deepest prayers,

895
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 as I've learned just surviving in Hong Kong

896
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 and just ministering here,

897
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 is that we quit being professional Christians.

898
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 We quit just running programs just for the sake of them,

899
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 but that we truly understand who we are.

900
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 Romans 8 says, "All creation is longing,

901
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 eagerly longing for the revealing

902
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
 of the children of God."

903
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 This city needs us to know who we are.

904
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 People who are undone by the gospel,

905
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 confronted by Jesus himself,

906
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 and that confrontation leads to a transformation

907
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 that makes us completely new and different.

908
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 Peter was obnoxious, impulsive, and inconsiderate,

909
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 and yet when he was filled with the Spirit,

910
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 he completely transforms and changes

911
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 into this different person.

912
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 When he goes face to face with his mistakes,

913
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 and then the Lord restores him,

914
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 he is completely transformed.

915
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 And then he preaches a sermon that does the same

916
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 to thousands, who then spread it to more thousands,

917
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 who then spread it to more and more.

918
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
 Can we in this room here understand that?

919
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
 Can we get to grips with the fact that we are bad news,

920
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 that we do have bad news,

921
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
 that every day we're surrounded by bad news?

922
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
 I fight the temptations and the distractions of this world

923
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
 every single day myself.

924
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
 Paul talks about this in Romans 7.

925
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
 What I should do, I don't do.

926
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
 What I shouldn't do, I'm doing.

927
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
 What a wretched man I am.

928
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
 That's the Apostle Paul speaking.

929
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 But then he said, "But thank goodness we have Jesus,

930
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
 "who came and paid the price,

931
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
 "who shares with us that good news."

932
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
 Let us understand that today.

933
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
 And this is my request to you.

934
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
 The woman who goes to Jesus smashes her alabaster jar.

935
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 What she's saying is, actually this is very interesting.

936
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
 Why is a woman of the city having an alabaster jar?

937
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 She's trying to attract people.

938
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
 It's her livelihood.

939
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
 This is what she uses to make money.

940
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 And in that moment of confrontation,

941
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
 and in that moment of transformation,

942
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
 she takes it off, smashes it and says,

943
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
 "I won't be needing this anymore.

944
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 "I won't be needing the approval of men anymore.

945
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
 "I won't be needing the acceptance.

946
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
 "I won't need to fight for my own survival anymore.

947
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 "I am willing to give up everything,

948
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
 "everything that I think I'm doing to save my life,

949
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
 "to be a good person, I can just throw it all away

950
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
 "and put my trust in this guy.

951
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 "Take everything."

952
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
 Simon, the Pharisee, the professional Christian,

953
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
 approached Jesus with his head.

954
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
 The woman approaches with everything.

955
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 And says, "You can have everything.

956
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 "You are worth everything."

957
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
 And she knew that.

958
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
 And I hope that we do too.

959
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
 And so as I pray, can I encourage you to think,

960
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
 what's the thing around your neck?

961
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 What's the alabaster jar?

962
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
 What's the thing that you're using for your survival?

963
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 Or is it the mind, like the Pharisee,

964
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,000
 who just wants to engage in intellectual debate

965
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,000
 and see who knows more about Scripture?

966
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
 And so we can look down on other people

967
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
 and feel better about ourselves.

968
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 What is it?

969
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 Would you lay it down?

970
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
 Would you lay it down at the feet of Jesus?

971
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 This whole story is scandalous.

972
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
 It's ridiculous.

973
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 It would be awkward in any era

974
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 that a sinner would touch the feet

975
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 of someone in such a way.

976
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 Is there anything more ridiculous than that?

977
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 I need to tell you there is.

978
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 Just like this woman knelt down

979
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 and wept at the feet of Jesus,

980
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 the Prince of Heaven himself

981
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
 then turns it around

982
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 and washes the feet of sinners.

983
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,000
 That is even more scandalous.

984
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
 That is even more ridiculous.

985
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
 That fact alone should blow your mind

986
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
 and it should change everything

987
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
 and you should smash every alabaster jar you have.

988
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
 Give up your life of being a professional Christian

989
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
 and open yourself up to the one who confronts,

990
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
 who accepts, who loves, who transforms.

991
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
 Let's pray.

992
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:48,000
 So Father, we come before you

993
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
 and we ask that you would confront us

994
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 with that good news once again.

995
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,000
 Lord, we believe, help our unbelief.

996
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,000
 Many of us know of our own broken state,

997
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
 our own selfishness, our own sin.

998
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
 But we have not yet actually been confronted

999
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
 by the good news.

1000
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 The world, we who are dead,

1001
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
 who are lost, who are blind,

1002
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
 have been confronted with the good news

1003
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
 that changes everything.

1004
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
 Because now we are made alive together

1005
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
 now we can see, now we are found,

1006
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 now we are known.

1007
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,000
 Because of you.

1008
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 A thousand times we failed yet your mercy remains.

1009
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
 Your will above all else,

1010
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 the art of losing ourselves.

1011
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
 We lose ourselves at your feet again, Lord.

1012
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
 Would you cleanse us, purify us

1013
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
 from the inside out.

1014
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
 Would you create a clean heart in us.

1015
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 Would you renew a right spirit within us.

1016
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
 Let us hear joy and gladness.

1017
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
 Let the bones you have broken rejoice.

1018
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
 Restore to us the joy of your salvation.

1019
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,000
 Because Lord, you are the everlasting one

1020
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
 when all else fails.

1021
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

1022
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:29,000
