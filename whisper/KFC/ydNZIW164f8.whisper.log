[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Good evening everyone, good to see you all.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   There's a lot of things that have been happening full stop in the world.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Christina and I and our family have been in Hong Kong for four and a half years now,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   and it's just been non-stop change anyway.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   But I can speak to you honestly about this.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I don't know if it's something that we're going to be able to do.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   I don't know if it's something that we really, really wanted to do.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   But there's one thing that has been driving Christina and I and our hearts throughout all of our time.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   The reason why we came to Hong Kong actually was to pursue God's heart.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   At that time we didn't know that there was going to be something called the protest.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We'd never been in one ourselves.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   I didn't know what an extradition bill was.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   I didn't know what LegCo was.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   I just spelt Lego wrong.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   So I didn't know what COVID was.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   I didn't know what starting a church really meant.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And I can tell you honestly now,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I've spoken very openly with some fellow leaders in this church as we've been talking and praying about this,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   is quite frankly I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   But I know exactly what I'm doing.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I know that doesn't make sense.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   But that's been my life.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   So welcome to my life.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   But part of that is just going, actually God, what is your heart?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   What is it that you want we as your church to know during this time?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It's a tumultuous time across the world.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   The church is changing itself.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   The young people are leaving our churches.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And actually we don't really know what to do.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And I'm here to say, look, neither do I.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   But I know that God has a heart for them.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And I know God has a heart to reach them.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   The mission and organization that I'm still going to be part of is Young Life.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And the motto is how do we go to where the young people are at?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And how do we earn the right to be heard?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   How do we not just be a church service?
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I know some of us are visitors here and welcome.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   And this may be your first time, but I hope it's not your last.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   But I also want you to know that this isn't just a service that we're running.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Because if it was just a service that you wanted,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   there's plenty of places that you can go just to find a service.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   In fact, there's a service that you can attend at home.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   As long as you type in youtube.com,
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   you'll be able to find some sermons that are much better than what I'm about to share.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   But that's not really the point.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I don't think that's the heart of God.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   As I look at the scriptures, as I look at this, I think there's more to it.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Because if it was just a lesson that we needed to learn,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I don't know if Jesus needed to come back to do it.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   If it was just a set of doctrine we needed to memorize,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I don't think we needed the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   And I don't think it would have caught fire to the point where it outlived the Roman Empire.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   There's something more than just a service, a lecture.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The original word for church is ecclesia, is gathering, and it's an assembly.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It's a body of people who are all confronted by the same thing.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   And I wanted to share today, we've been going through the heart of Jesus in this series.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And we started, Johnny was talking about the heart, the touches.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   That Jesus goes beside the broken, the lepers even, and he's willing to touch them.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   He's willing to heal them.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   He's willing to stand beside the broken and be filled with compassion.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And he's also the one who's looking for faith.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And I shared about this, about the centurion.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   He's looking for people who are willing to put their complete faith in him.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   2 Chronicles 16, 9, the Lord is just going to and through the earth,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   looking for people whose hearts are blameless, and he will strengthen them.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   John 4, Jesus is talking to this woman at the well, and he's saying,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   "The Father is looking for those who will worship him in spirit and in truth."
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   He's looking for these people.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And last week, Michelle talked about, actually, he has a heart to accept.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Those people who are broken, those people who are sinners, he welcomes them in.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And we as a church, who are also welcomed by him, are then supposed to welcome other people.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Today, the title of the talk is "A Heart That Confronts."
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   A heart that confronts.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Confront, we often use--we think about in an almost negative way.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   It's someone, when Kelly's done something wrong,
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   then I'm going to figure out how I'm going to confront you.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   But really, confront is just, actually, I want to bring this situation to the forefront,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and I'm going to talk about it with you face-to-face.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   That's what confront means.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Who's done the Enneagram test before?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Some people have done the--oh, not really many.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Enneagram test--Charles, good to see you.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   What Enneagram are you? Do you know?
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Do you remember?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   So there's different--there's nine.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   There's different personality traits.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Of course, with some of these tests, it's kind of like you are who you say you are.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   As you're answering them, "Oh, do you like hosting parties?"
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   "Yeah." "Are you a friendly person?" "Oh, sure I am."
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   You answer the questions.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Of course, some people will answer them properly.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Anyway, the whole point is that there's nine characteristics,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   nine personalities that we kind of generally fit into, kind of.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And one of them is Enneagram 8.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   It is the challenger.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   You had people in your life who liked to challenge.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   You say something, you're like, "No, I don't agree with that."
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   People in your workplace, when you're in a meeting, you have ideas.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Next to the challenger, number 8, is number 9, and he's the peacemaker.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Well, she's the peacemaker.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   She's like, "Everyone, just--everyone, just--it's all okay.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Let's just agree."
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And then the challenger will go, "Well, I don't agree that we should just agree.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   I think we should agree to disagree, and I think we should talk about it,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   and I think we should spend a lot of time debating about this
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   because that's how we'll get better."
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   And they're not wrong, but sometimes they can come across as jerks.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   But actually, the heart of it is actually--there's actually good things.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   So we think about being confronted, and I realized this.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And as I was preparing this message, I realized that Jesus is a confronter.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Jesus, kind and compassionate, with his blonde hair and blue eyes,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   floating because he doesn't have feet, and he just floats and loves on people
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   and heals everything that he touches, is not quite the Jesus of the Bible.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Jesus confronts.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Jesus goes to people where they're at, earns the right to be heard,
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   and then speaks into that and confronts them.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   You see in John 2, he's just starting his ministry.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   He's just been to a wedding, and he's had a great time.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   He wants to just chill with his friends.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Mom says, "Hey, there's a problem with the wine.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Can you deal with it, and can you sort it?"
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   And then he says, "Mom, I don't really want to.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   It's not really time. Can I do it later?"
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And then Mom just says, "No. Do it."
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And then he does it.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And then he goes to the temple, and he sees all these people
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   who are completely using the temple for the wrong reason.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   They're supposed to be there to worship God,
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   and yet they've turned it into this currency exchange place
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   where they're selling goats and lambs and everything
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   for convenience and for profit, and then he just loses it.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   So you see this kind, compassionate, gentle Jesus suddenly completely turn
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   because it touches a nerve.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   What is that nerve? What is it, the thing that he cares about the most?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Luke 4, verse 44, he says this.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   "This was the reason I came. For this reason I was sent."
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   What was that reason?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   "I must preach the good news to the other towns as well."
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I think that's what he confronts us with.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   He confronts us with the good news.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   He confronts us with the gospel.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   The problem here is this.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I know this for sure.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I think there are people in this room here with us
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   who have not been confronted with the gospel.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Have a think now what that even means for you.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Well, let's just dial it back a bit if it's your first time
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   and I'm not trying to freak you out here.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   What is the gospel?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   The gospel is just good news.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And Kelly shared about this so eloquently as she was leading.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   The good news is that someone paid the price.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   The cross was supposed to be ours.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   The death was supposed to be ours, but someone came in and said,
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   "I've got it. Put it on my tab."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   That's the gospel.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   But here's the problem.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I think there's people here who haven't been confronted
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   with the gospel and I'll tell you why.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Because before you are able to accept and embrace
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   and welcome this good news, you first have to realize
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that there is bad news.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Otherwise, the good news means nothing.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   So we need to know what that bad news is.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I was just having a breakfast with a dear friend
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   who's just been on the journey of the faith
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   and he's just trying to figure things out.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And he says, "You know what, James?
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   You know what's happened?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I'm losing my hope in humanity as I find out more
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   about the faith."
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And I was like, "Whoa. Tell me more."
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   He said, "Well, before I found out about this stuff,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I was kind of like, 'Hey, I'm just a good person.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Considering starting a family, you know, bring a good person
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   into this world and we'll just kind of do good things.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   We're kind of good people.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Pay all our taxes and don't push old ladies.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   We're okay. We're good.'
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   But as I find out more about the gospel,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   as I'm seeing the world as it is,
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I'm getting more and more discouraged
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   because this world's not a good place.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   There's darkness.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It's not as good as I thought it was."
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And I was like--well, one part, I was like, "Oh, man.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   My sermons are not helping you at all.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   This is going the wrong way."
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   But then I realized, actually, no, it's going the right way
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   because in order for us to be confronted with the gospel,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   the good news, we first have to understand
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   what the bad news is.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   In order for us to feel overjoyed that, man,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   someone came to save us,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   someone came to pay the whole thing for us,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   we first have to understand that we're in debt,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   that we're drowning.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And so he's starting to get it.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   He's like, "You know what else there is?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   The world is a dark place, but I've started noticing
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   that I'm a bad person."
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And it made me think of the Tim Keller quote.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   What is the good news?
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   It is that I'm far worse than I imagined,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   but far more loved than I ever dare dream.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   As I encounter the gospel,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   as I look at the Jesus of the Bible,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   I start to see, man, he's confronting me
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   with something that's very interesting,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   with bad news, that actually I thought I was doing well,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I thought I was a good person.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   But as I search more, I realize that actually
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   I'm not so good at all, and that's bad news.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   And I fall short of the glory of God,
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   and I am not holy because we're told to be holy,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   but I'm not.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   But there is good news.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   He saved us.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Ephesians 2 talked about this.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   He's saying, actually, you were dead in your trespasses and sins.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   You were following the course of this world.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   You were following the prince and the power of the air.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   You were satisfying all the desires of your flesh.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   That's us.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   He carries on later.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   He says, you remember at one time,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   you were lost without hope.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   You were strangers to the promise.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   You were separated from Christ.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   But then the biggest two words that you can see in Ephesians 2,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I think, is, but God.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   But God, rich in mercy,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   because of the great love that he had for us,
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   made us alive together.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   That's the good news.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   And it's interesting, because as we look at the scripture
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   that we have today, my question for you is,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   have you been confronted with that good news?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Have you been confronted with that gospel?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   As we think about what this gathering, KFCI gathering,
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   looks like, I look at Acts 2.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   I look at the energy that they had,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   that there were people just coming in filled with just joy
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   and power and living in a way that was completely supernatural
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and different to the way of the world.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   What was the key?
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   What was the recipe?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   The gospel.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   The good news.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   And they were cut to the heart, Acts 2.37.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   They were cut to the heart.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   My question to you, brothers and sisters, today is,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   have you ever been cut to the heart?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Because if you haven't, then maybe we're still waiting
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   for that moment for the Lord to confront you.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   But don't be afraid.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   It doesn't end on bad news.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   The point of the gospel is that it will cut us to the heart,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   but then it will fill us with a joy and an aura and wonder
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   that will completely change everything.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   There was a sinner.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   There was a woman.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   She tried relationships lots of times, five times, in fact,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   and she'd married five times, and finally she gave up on that.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And then so she started just living with the sixth man,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   and then she gets confronted by Jesus.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   This story is in John 4.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   No one likes her.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   The whole of the town avoids her, and she avoids them
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   because of the shame.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   The women would go to get the water in the morning or at night
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   because it's simply too hot.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   It's kind of like this weather.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   You're not supposed to be walking outside around noon,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   but she's going to get water at noon.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Why?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Because she's avoiding people.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And yet, little did she know that she gets confronted
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   by a man, but not just any man.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And this confrontation that he calls her out on
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   doesn't lead to shame, doesn't lead to embarrassment,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   doesn't completely just break her, and she's in tears,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   and she just wants to hide in a hole.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   She doesn't do that.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   What does she do?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   I'll tell the long story short.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Jesus says, "Hey, go and find your husband."
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   And she's like, "I don't have a husband."
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And then he's like, "I know.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   And the one you're living with isn't your husband,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   but you've been married five times, so you've been trying hard at this."
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And then they have this long conversation,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   and he talks to her about how actually there will be a moment
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   where she will be able to worship in spirit and in truth,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   and that moment is now.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   She is confronted with the gospel, and what happens?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   She can't wait and run back into the town and say,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   "Everyone, everyone, everyone, you know how bad I am,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   but there's a man who knew all of that and told me everything
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   that I've ever done, but I feel no shame.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Come and see.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Come and find him."
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I'll tell you what confrontation leads to.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Confrontation leads to transformation.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   If you haven't felt that cut to the heart,
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   maybe you've not been confronted,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   and maybe that's why you have not transformed yet.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Maybe that's why you're still struggling with the same things
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   that you're struggling with.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Maybe that's why you're actually not filled with the joy of living,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   the Christian living, which is basically knowing that God is real,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   that He's here with you, and that He loves you,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   but maybe you need to be cut to the heart and undone by the gospel,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   and you'll be able to experience that.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   We see a very interesting thing that happens here.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Luke 7.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Charlotte, I'm going to try my best to read out the verses
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   as quick as possible so you can find it, okay?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   But the next one isn't on there.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Luke 7, just to set the context, Jesus' ministry is gaining steam.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   It says 17--actually, I will read the 17 first.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Luke 7, verse 17, it's not on the slides.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   It says, "And this report about him spread throughout the whole of Judea
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   and all the surrounding country."
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   So Jesus is doing stuff and it's starting to spread.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   People are hearing about this.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   He opened his thread up, and everyone's following him.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   They're trying to figure out what he's trying to do,
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   relating to the young people.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Paul's laughing, he knows.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And so what happens next is this.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Now, you know that his archrival are the Pharisees.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   I like to call these the professional Christians.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Actually, what breaks my heart is I think there are a lot
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   of professional Christians in Hong Kong, even in our churches.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   People who have said, "Oh, we're going to do this,"
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   but then it ends up just being for a living,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   ends up just to run a corporation, a business, a ministry.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   We put the programs over the people, and we lose the heart
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   of what we're actually trying to do.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   But anyway, so there's this professional Christian, Pharisee.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Him and his boys are hearing about all this stuff.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And admittedly, to be honest, I actually think they get a bad rep
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   because if I was that person at that moment as a professional
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Christian in the town, Pharisees were rich people
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   who were also religious rulers.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   But who is this guy?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Why is he causing all this kerfuffle?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Why are all these people following him?
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   And why are they all completely transformed?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Even the sinners are completely turning around.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   So he does the next thing, which I think is pretty brave of him.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   [speaking in foreign language]
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Bring him in and bring him to the house and have a meal.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   But he tries to confront Jesus, and he does it with his boys.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   So he welcomes them into his home, and they sit around,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   and that's the context of what he's trying to do.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   And we find out more about that.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   So you have this Pharisee, and this story here,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   this passage here is really about three people.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   It's about Jesus, it's about the professional Christian,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   and it's about the professional sinner.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   This is the beginning of a really funny joke that I haven't written.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   What happens when Jesus, a professional Christian,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   and a professional sinner have dinner together?
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   We find out what happens exactly.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   So here we go, and I'm going to start reading some of it for you.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Luke 7, verse 37, let's go, 36.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   and he went into the Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   So this isn't him being an adolescent.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   This is how they sat when they had dinner.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   So they wouldn't be sitting upright.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   They would have these long chaise longs that they sit on,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   and they'd sit like this, and they would tuck their feet around the back.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   You'd just lean on your left elbow while you're picking off food.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   That's what he does.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   So Jesus sits down, and this is the custom.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   He sits down, and he reclines at the table, and he starts eating.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   But then the problem appears.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Verse 37, "And behold, a woman of the city who was a sinner,
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee's house,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   brought an alabaster flask of ointment."
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Let's stop there.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   So this woman, a woman of the city, a sinner,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   most commentators think that this was used to describe a prostitute.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   So this woman hears about Jesus having dinner at this Pharisee's house.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Now, what was also the custom was, as you invite someone to dinner,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   you'll have people around the table, but actually the doors were open
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   for anyone to come and stand on the walls around the outside to listen in,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   just to see what's going on.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   There's going to be drama.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   There's going to be a battle.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   There's going to be a rap battle, and we're going to see if the Pharisee
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   will beat Jesus.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   And so the doors are open.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   So this woman hears about this, and then she comes in and joins.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Now, likely, people think, "There's no way, actual way of knowing here is,"
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   there's likely, she's probably been confronted with the gospel herself previously.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   She's probably met Jesus, heard his teachings from before.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   So she's very keen and eager, desperate, desperate to go in.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   A woman of the city, a sinner, goes in to this Pharisee's home.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   She's got to be desperate because people would frown upon her coming into this.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   But she's like, "I don't care.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   What I just heard him say out there the other day, something--I need to go see him.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   I need to go see him, and I need to go and talk to him, so I'm going to go find him."
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   And so basically she sneaks in, and she stands right behind where he's reclining.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And then, and she has an alabaster flask of ointment.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Often people, women like that, would hang the alabaster jar,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   which is about this size, and it's got a really narrow neck,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   and she would hang it around her neck.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And of course, in the ointment there, a very expensive ointment,
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   would give off a perfume that is very attractive and very nice.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And so she sneaks in behind Jesus, and she stands there,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   hoping to hear about it, hear about what he's got to say.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   In verse 38, "And standing behind him at his feet, weeping,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment."
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Okay, this is as weird as it sounds.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   And it was as weird back then as it would be right now.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   Okay, so there's no context here that you need to know.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   This is strange, okay?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   This woman goes in, she wants to talk to Jesus, I imagine, that's only my guess.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   The scripture doesn't say any more.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   I can imagine she's broken through, she's plucked up the courage to go in,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   and she just wants to talk to him.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   There's just something that she needs--she knows something needs to be done.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   And so she stands there, hoping maybe just to stand behind,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   just listening on the conversation, but here's what happens.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   When we are confronted with the gospel, sometimes,
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   especially when it's the source of the gospel, the creator himself,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   I can totally imagine this.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   This has happened to me before.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   She's just completely undone.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   I think we know what that feeling is like, maybe when we're near a loved one.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Maybe when we're so broken and desperate, and there's just someone
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   that is very important to us, and we're just next to them,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   and you just can't control your emotions anymore.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   That's my feeling of what she's doing.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   She wants to try and engage, but then she just can't.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   She's just crying.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   And it's embarrassing now because she's just weeping,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   and the tears are dripping onto his feet.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   He's reclining back like this, right?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   And so he's dropping onto his feet, and then she's like,
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   "I don't know what to do. I can't wipe it."
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   So the only thing that she can do is to loosen her hair.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I mean, it's funny that I'm doing this right now, but--
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   [laughter]
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   It's been a long time since I know what that feels like.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   George, come here.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   I see you, Charles. Nice and bright.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   We've got to-- Bold and courageous, that's what we are.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   So she-- And then she lets--
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Now, I need to tell you again how scandalous that is,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   because women aren't supposed to do that.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   You can get arrested for that.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   So she does it anyway, because it might be the only thing
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   that she has to wipe his feet.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   So she just unties it, and then she just uses--
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   "Oh, my goodness, I'm freaking out now,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   because I'm next to Jesus, and now I'm crying,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   and now I'm-- Ah!"
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   "Just wipe it, wipe it."
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   That's the scene, okay?
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   And here's the funny thing.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Verse 39.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   "Simon, the Pharisee, the professional Christian.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   he said to himself, 'Simon thinks, not Simon says.'"
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Simon thinks, and there's an irony in this
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   that is just beautiful.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   "Simon thinks to himself, 'If this man were a prophet,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   he would have known who and what sort of woman this is
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   who is touching him, for she is a sinner.'"
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   You can imagine this, right?
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   He's going, "Man, I thought I was going to confront him,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   and I thought we were going to have a battle,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   but this guy can't even tell who she is.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   He's thinking this."
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And in this strange moment of irony,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Jesus knows what he's thinking and replies to him.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   He's not said a word.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   He's just thinking about this,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   and yet Jesus, proving that he's actually not even just a prophet,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   he then goes, "Simon, Simon, I have something to say to you."
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Tim Keller often jokes about this.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   If you read Jesus saying-- If Jesus says to you,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   "Hey, I have something to say to you,"
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   you should be worried.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   You should be very, very worried.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And so Jesus replies his thought,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   and he answers, "Say it, teacher."
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   And then here is the moment where Jesus confronts him.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   At this point, he's not done anything.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   He's just come in. He's just reclining. He's eating.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   He knows what this is about,
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   but he's just kind of going along with it.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Of course, the very sad woman is behind him
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   just weeping and causing a scene.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   And then he tells him a parable, which is what Jesus often does.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Verse 41, "A certain moneylender, a creditor, who had two debtors,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   one owed 500 denarii and the other 50.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   When they could not pay, he canceled the debt of both.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Now which of them will love him more?"
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   So he tells him a very simple parable
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   because he wants to teach him something.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   He wants to highlight something.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   But maybe let's pause here,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   and let's talk about some differences that we have
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   between the professional Christian and the professional sinner.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   Let's talk about even the attitude.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Because what we'll find out,
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   and I'll go back to the parable later,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   the attitude is very different here.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   The Pharisee invites him in to confront him.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   He wants to challenge him.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   He wants to have an intellectual debate.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   He wants to just go to war with words and with theology
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   and with the Old Testament.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   He wants to do that.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   But the professional sinner, the woman,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   has a completely different agenda.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   She's been confronted with the Gospel,
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   and she just wants transformation.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   She just needs to be around him.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   And it's just completely undone by the Gospel there.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Completely open, completely vulnerable.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Whereas the Pharisee, actually we find out later,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   he doesn't even invite, he doesn't even do the customs
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   that actually Jesus will talk about in a minute.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Here's the interesting thing.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   She applies the ointment onto him.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   The way to apply the ointment,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   the way to get the ointment out of the jar,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   do you know what you have to do?
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Smash it.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   That's the only thing.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   It's a one-time only coupon.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   So she's freaking out.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   She's crying.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   She has to dry his feet with air.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   And then to the point where now it's all over.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Everyone's watching her.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   She's undone.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   She doesn't know what she's doing.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   So she's trying to wipe it.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   She's applying ointment.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   She's kissing it.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   She's kissing his feet.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   She's just like, "Oh my goodness.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   "I'm face to face with this guy
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   "who's just completely just confronted me
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   "with this good news,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   "and I just completely can't contain myself."
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Meanwhile, the Pharisee is probably reclining on his couch
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   going, "Jesus, let me see how good you are
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   "with your intellectual theological chops.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   "I want to know if you're legit.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   "I want to know if you're a prophet.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   "Actually, you clearly don't look like a prophet.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   "You can't even tell what kind of woman this is.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   "I clearly know this kind of woman."
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   The attitude is different,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   but I think the biggest difference
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   is the awareness is different.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   I had a dinner the other night,
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and got to meet some new people,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   which is always fun for me,
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   until they find out what I do.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   So we have a dinner table,
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   and I'm sitting around with some friends.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Someone invited me,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   and there's just all these other people,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   and they go, "Oh, what do you do?"
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   "Oh, I'm in private equity."
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   I'm like, "Oh, okay.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   "I don't really know what that is."
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   "I'm in hedge funds."
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   "Oh, okay.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   "Don't know what that is.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   "Okay."
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   "I'm in consulting."
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   I'm like, "Oh, okay."
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   And it just keeps going around,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   and many of them are non-believers,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   and they're just talking,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   and swearing, and drinking.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   And they're like, "Oh, what do you do, James?"
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   "I'm a pastor."
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   They're like, "Oh, I thought this was
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   "like a finance consulting thing."
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I'm like, "Me too, but I don't know.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   "I knew that, but I don't know why I'm here,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   "but I'm just here."
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   And anyway, this is the life of a pastor.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   The moment you reveal that,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   you're the party pooper.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   It's like, "Oh, oh, you were swearing."
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   I'm like, "Yep, yep, he was swearing.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   "Yep, yep, he's probably going to hell."
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   And then, of course, they're like, "Oh."
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And then I'm like, "Okay, so, are you a Christian?"
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   "Do you?"
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   And then he's like, "Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   "I'm a bad person.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   "I don't do that kind of stuff.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   "Yeah, yeah, 'cause yeah, I would never be allowed in."
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   And then, "Oh, but he is."
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And then he looks at me, "You're a Christian, aren't you?"
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And he's like, "Oh, yeah, I grew up in the church.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   "Yeah, yeah, yeah, but now I'm talking to a pastor.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   "I'm a bad Christian."
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   That's what he said.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   And, of course, I'm seeing this enough of this.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   I've been a party pooper for quite a number of years now.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   But then, at that moment,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   I really felt something that I needed to say.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   And this was it, actually.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   The person who said that they were a bad person,
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   he's probably not wrong.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   But the person who said that they were a bad Christian,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   they're definitely wrong.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   Because there's no such thing as a bad Christian.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Christians are people who know they're bad
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   and know that they were saved.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   There's no such thing as a bad--
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   The moment you think there's a bad Christian thing,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   some of you might go, "Oh, yeah, I'm a pretty bad Christian."
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   No, you see, it's not good nor bad.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   A Christian is someone who just knows that they were dead
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   and that they needed to be saved.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   That's it.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   You can't qualify it with good or bad.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   Or maybe on the other side,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   is maybe you're sitting there going,
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   "Hmm, I'm a pretty good Christian."
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   There's no such thing as a good Christian.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   The Bible is very clear on this.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   Jesus is very clear on this.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   No one is good.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   None of you are good.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   All of you fall short of the glory of God,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   but all of you are justified freely by His grace as a gift.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   There's no such thing as good and bad Christians.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   So I had a really fun conversation
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   explaining what that really meant.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   So I think the Pharisee had this problem.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   He didn't really realize.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   He thought he was a model believer.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   Everyone in this town respected him,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   mostly because he had money and influence
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   and because he was disciplined somewhat.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   But his awareness was gone.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Whereas the professional sinner,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   the woman of the city,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   knew exactly her state.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   That's a huge difference.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   The question is, are we blind like Simon
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   or are we aware like the woman?
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   It's a very important point.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Jesus in Matthew 15 says,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   actually, He's talking to the Pharisees
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   and He's saying, "You guys have all these traditions
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   "and you're following all these commandments.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   "You worship me with your lips,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   "but your hearts are far from me."
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   That's a professional Christian.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   That's someone who says he is Lord,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   but then actually lives a completely different life inside.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   The question for us is, what are we?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Have we been confronted with the gospel?
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   And you might be like, "Yeah, you know, you nailed it.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   "I'm a bad person."
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   I'm like, "That's okay.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   "That's why this is perfect for you."
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Because you need to know that even that woman
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   was welcomed in by Jesus.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Even that woman was accepted.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   And you need to know that there's nothing
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   that you've done in your past
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   that will stop Him from loving you.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Nothing will separate you from the love of Christ.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   But if you're the other side,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   you're like, "I've been going to church all my life.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   "I've been serving.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   "I've been serving in VBS and BSF and ABC and Alpha.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   "I've done all the courses."
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   This message is also for you
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   because the question remains,
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   you can do all of those things
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   but not be cut to the heart,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   not be confronted with the gospel.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   That's the danger.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   That's what Simon is going through right here
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   and he's having a master class on it.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   He thought he was here for an intellectual debate,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   but he thought he was going to confront Jesus,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   but instead Jesus is confronting him.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Now there is a similarity between the two
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   that I want to highlight in this parable.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   He says, "One owed 500 denarii,"
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   which is about a year and a half's wage,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   "and the other owed 50."
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   That's about two months.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   So one person owed a year and a half
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   to two years' worth of wages, which is a lot,
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   and then the other just owed a month or two.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   "When they could not pay, he cancelled the debt of both.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   "Now which of them will love him more?"
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Verse 43, Simon answers,
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   "The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt."
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I mean, you can see Simon is still a moron here.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   "Oh, well, I suppose it's that guy."
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Well, of course it's that guy
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   because he had a whole year or two years' salary forgiven.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I was just talking to Paul about this.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   Paul has three pairs of shoes.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Okay, just three.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   He has a pair of Vans, which he didn't know were Vans
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   until I had a discussion with him about it,
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   that they were Vans.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   He has a pair of dress shoes.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   I don't know when he uses those dress shoes.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And a pair of running shoes.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   I definitely don't know when you use those.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   So Paul has three pairs of shoes.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Pass the Johnny.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   How many pairs of shoes do you have?
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   - 20.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   - More than that.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   - More than that.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   - Like 200.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   - 100.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   - You haven't counted.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Still learning how to count above 100.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Three digits.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   That's what he's doing.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   - Look, he's hanging on the ceiling already.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   - They're everywhere.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Imagine Johnny and Paul both had a debt.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   They both owed someone something.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   And then basically what they owed was their shoes.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Paul only has three pairs that he could potentially lose.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Johnny has 250.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   [laughter]
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Imagine at that moment the creditor both says,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   "Actually, neither of you need to give me your shoes back."
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Who's more happy in that moment?
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   Who's more happy?
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   That's where Simon the Pharisee says,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   "Well, I suppose."
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   Well, it's not suppose.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   It's obviously Johnny because sneakers are his life.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Yeah?
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   - Paul will get more.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   - He'll probably go get more, yes.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   That's why we're praying for a wife.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   We need a wife.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   That's what we need.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   [laughter]
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   So here's what he's saying.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   He's saying, "But the interesting thing isn't actually Johnny or Paul.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   It isn't the 500 denarii.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   It isn't the 50."
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   What he says is this.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   "Neither of them can pay."
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Because actually, legally, do you know what that means?
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   They have one similarity.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   They're both going to prison.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   It doesn't matter whether you've done all of this stuff,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   all of this sin,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   or whether you've just done a little, little bit of sin.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   You're both going to prison.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   In the eyes of the law, you are both the same.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   It's got nothing to do whether you're a professional Christian
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   or you're a professional sinner.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Both of you owe something, and both of you cannot pay.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   That's the point of the parable.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   It wasn't who sinned more and who lost.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   The point is, you're both the same.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   All of us here in this room,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   whether we've been confronted with the Gospel or not,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   whether we're a Christian or not,
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   whether we've been to church for 70 years,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   or this is our first time,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   do you get it?
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   We're all in the same boat.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   We're all in need of the Gospel.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   We're all in need of the good news.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   There is absolutely no difference.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   There is no point looking at someone and going, "They're worse."
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   This is where I'll finish.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   You and I should have her mindset instead of his,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   but often, those of us who are Christians,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   who have been in the church circles,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   we look down on other people who are different to us,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   who are swearing, who are doing all these other things
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   that we just think are judging,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   and we're like, "You know what?
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Yeah, that's bad."
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   Now, of course, there are behaviors that need to be redeemed.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   When you are confronted, your life transforms.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   It changes.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   What does Jesus say when he talks to sinners?
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   He said, "Okay, you have been forgiven.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Go and sin no more."
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   So there has to be a transformation.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   There has to be a life change.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   But you and I both need to recognize,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   realize that actually we are,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   we could be the blind professional Christian
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   unless we're undone by the Gospel,
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   unless we've been confronted with the Gospel.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   You see, Jesus here is saying, "I am the creditor.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   You both owe me different things,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   and I'm saying it doesn't matter."
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And so, verse 48, he finishes here,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   and this is where I'll finish.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Verse 47 first, actually.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   Sorry, Charlotte.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   "Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   are forgiven, for she loved much,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   but he who has forgiven little loves little."
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And he said to her, verse 48, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   It's interesting.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   So he started off challenging Jesus,
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   going, "Is this guy even a prophet?"
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   And Jesus one-ups him, replies to what he's thinking,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   and then shows him that he's not only a prophet,
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   but he is God.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   He is the one who has the authority to even forgive.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Completely blows it out the water.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   And it freaks everyone out.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   They're like, "Oh, we thought we were going to come
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   and confront and have an intellectual debate,
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   and yet this guy is now forgiving sins."
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   But that's exactly what Jesus is.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   That is exactly who he is.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   He's saying, "You both owe me, but I forgive you both.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   The wages of sin is death,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   but I'm going to die as a ransom for many."
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   That's what he's saying here.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Jesus knows what he's going to do.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   Jesus knows this good news,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   this purpose that he was sent for,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   will require a cost.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Keller talks a lot about this as well.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   He says, "Forgiveness always comes with a price."
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Forgiveness is when you're willing to pay
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   for the consequences of someone else's sin.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   When we say, "Oh, Christians, we're supposed to forgive
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   and forget, just leave it, and it's okay,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   we make mistakes, there's grace."
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   No, there's always a price.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   When we choose to forgive someone that's hurt us
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   by not hurting them back, we're saying,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   "I'm going to take that on myself."
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   The creditor who releases both of these debts,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   what's he doing?
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   The debts don't disappear.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Someone pays.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   Who pays?
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   The creditor.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   The creditor says, "Okay, you both owe me.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   You owe me three pairs of shoes.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   You owe me 250 pairs of shoes.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   I'm going to let both of those debts go.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   I'm going to cancel them both.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Who's paying?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   I'm paying for 253 pairs of shoes."
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   That's why Jesus has that authority,
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   because he takes on that sin, and he says,
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   "Put it on my tab.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   I'm going to be going to the cross,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   and I'm going to be dealing with all of this
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   once and for all."
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   That was the purpose why I came.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   These people are living in bad news,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   but I'm here to tell them some good news,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   that I'm going to take the bad news off them,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   and I'm going to put it all onto me,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   and so that they can then live with the freedom
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   that I can give them, because I have now freed them
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   from that debt.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Brothers and sisters, that's the gospel.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   You know what?
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   This is one of my deepest prayers,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   as I've learned just surviving in Hong Kong
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   and just ministering here,
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   is that we quit being professional Christians.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   We quit just running programs just for the sake of them,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   but that we truly understand who we are.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   Romans 8 says, "All creation is longing,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   eagerly longing for the revealing
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   of the children of God."
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   This city needs us to know who we are.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   People who are undone by the gospel,
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   confronted by Jesus himself,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   and that confrontation leads to a transformation
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   that makes us completely new and different.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Peter was obnoxious, impulsive, and inconsiderate,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   and yet when he was filled with the Spirit,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   he completely transforms and changes
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   into this different person.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   When he goes face to face with his mistakes,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and then the Lord restores him,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   he is completely transformed.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   And then he preaches a sermon that does the same
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   to thousands, who then spread it to more thousands,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   who then spread it to more and more.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Can we in this room here understand that?
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Can we get to grips with the fact that we are bad news,
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   that we do have bad news,
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   that every day we're surrounded by bad news?
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I fight the temptations and the distractions of this world
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   every single day myself.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Paul talks about this in Romans 7.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   What I should do, I don't do.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   What I shouldn't do, I'm doing.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   What a wretched man I am.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   That's the Apostle Paul speaking.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   But then he said, "But thank goodness we have Jesus,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   "who came and paid the price,
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   "who shares with us that good news."
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Let us understand that today.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   And this is my request to you.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   The woman who goes to Jesus smashes her alabaster jar.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   What she's saying is, actually this is very interesting.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Why is a woman of the city having an alabaster jar?
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   She's trying to attract people.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   It's her livelihood.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   This is what she uses to make money.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   And in that moment of confrontation,
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   and in that moment of transformation,
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000]   she takes it off, smashes it and says,
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   "I won't be needing this anymore.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   "I won't be needing the approval of men anymore.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   "I won't be needing the acceptance.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   "I won't need to fight for my own survival anymore.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   "I am willing to give up everything,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   "everything that I think I'm doing to save my life,
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   "to be a good person, I can just throw it all away
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   "and put my trust in this guy.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   "Take everything."
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Simon, the Pharisee, the professional Christian,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   approached Jesus with his head.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   The woman approaches with everything.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And says, "You can have everything.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   "You are worth everything."
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   And she knew that.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   And I hope that we do too.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   And so as I pray, can I encourage you to think,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   what's the thing around your neck?
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   What's the alabaster jar?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   What's the thing that you're using for your survival?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Or is it the mind, like the Pharisee,
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   who just wants to engage in intellectual debate
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   and see who knows more about Scripture?
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   And so we can look down on other people
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   and feel better about ourselves.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   What is it?
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Would you lay it down?
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Would you lay it down at the feet of Jesus?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   This whole story is scandalous.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   It's ridiculous.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   It would be awkward in any era
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   that a sinner would touch the feet
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   of someone in such a way.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   Is there anything more ridiculous than that?
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   I need to tell you there is.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Just like this woman knelt down
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   and wept at the feet of Jesus,
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   the Prince of Heaven himself
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   then turns it around
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   and washes the feet of sinners.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   That is even more scandalous.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   That is even more ridiculous.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   That fact alone should blow your mind
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   and it should change everything
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   and you should smash every alabaster jar you have.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Give up your life of being a professional Christian
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   and open yourself up to the one who confronts,
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   who accepts, who loves, who transforms.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   Let's pray.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   So Father, we come before you
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   and we ask that you would confront us
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   with that good news once again.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Lord, we believe, help our unbelief.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Many of us know of our own broken state,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   our own selfishness, our own sin.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000]   But we have not yet actually been confronted
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   by the good news.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   The world, we who are dead,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   who are lost, who are blind,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   have been confronted with the good news
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   that changes everything.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Because now we are made alive together
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   now we can see, now we are found,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   now we are known.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Because of you.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   A thousand times we failed yet your mercy remains.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Your will above all else,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   the art of losing ourselves.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   We lose ourselves at your feet again, Lord.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Would you cleanse us, purify us
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   from the inside out.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Would you create a clean heart in us.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Would you renew a right spirit within us.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   Let us hear joy and gladness.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Let the bones you have broken rejoice.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Restore to us the joy of your salvation.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Because Lord, you are the everlasting one
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   when all else fails.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
