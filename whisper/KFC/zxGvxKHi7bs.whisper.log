[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   (Applause)
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Thank you, thank you.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Alright, so as some of you may have suspected,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   I'm not actually from Hong Kong.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Originally, I'm from Australia,
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   where I got this beautiful accent from.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Now, before I came to Hong Kong, I knew some things about it.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Subtropical place, in a changeover,
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   big financial hub, great food.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   I didn't know much, but I knew some things.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   As I came here, I started to see the skyscrapers with my own eyes.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   I tasted the dim sum, I rode the ferry.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   I started to clock some experience with the city.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   And then, over time, I have my own things that I love about Hong Kong.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   My favourite restaurants, my favourite places to go.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I have my own frustrations.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   I get to know some of the people and the culture.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   I went through some pretty significant events with Hong Kong.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Now, I went through this city with sheer joy
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   and also various uncertainties.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Now, I still don't know Hong Kong fully.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   I don't even speak Guangdong dialect.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   But you can see the difference from when I first came,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   where I kind of knew some things about the city,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   to now where I'm really kind of knowing the city.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I feel the heartbeat.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I understand it a bit.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I understand the one and a half different seasons here.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   The more I know it, the easier it becomes home.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Now, this is the same as how we want to grow with knowing God.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   To move on the journey from knowing about God
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   to knowing Him deeply.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And to do this, we're going to start with Psalm 23,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   the Psalm that is at the core of this book,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   "Don't give the enemy a seat at your table."
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   He leads me beside still waters.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   He restores my soul.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   He leads me on paths of righteousness for His name's sake.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Now, I don't know about you, but as we read,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies,"
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   it's easy to get a little envious of this,
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   even though it's true for us.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   But with His enemies around Him, David is focused on God.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   He is focused on Your goodness, and love will follow me.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And look at how David describes God earlier in Psalm 23.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   "He restores my soul. He leads me beside still waters.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I will fear no evil, for you are with me."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Now, this about our God is as true for you as it is for me as it was for David.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   So then why so often, when God is with us in the presence of our enemies,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   do we want to focus on our enemies rather than on God?
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Now, the key difference is this.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Often when I'm reciting Psalm 23 to myself,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I'm simply reminding myself of things I know about God.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Now, this is a good thing to do.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   But David didn't just know these things about God,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   but he is listing out his experience with God.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   As Pastor John pointed out earlier in this series,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   this Psalm wasn't some nice lullaby.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It was written from a full life with God,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   a full life of mountains and valleys with God.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Not just mountains and valleys, mountains and valleys with God.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Now, David is declaring these things from a place of knowing God,
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   from walking with Him, from a life of having been open and vulnerable with Him,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   from experiencing and understanding His grace and forgiveness.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   It is through all this that even in the presence of the enemies,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   he is focused on God.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Now, last year we had Pastor Francis Chan come and speak to us,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and one of the things he urged was that we can look at the menu,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   we can look and see that God is good,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   but we don't want to be just stuck looking at the menu.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   We want to do as David does, says in Psalm 34, 8.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   We want to taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   We want to experience that God is good, that He is with us.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   This is where David wrote this Psalm from.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And to unpack one reason why this is so important,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   when God is right before us in the presence of our enemies,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   the more we know Him, the easier it is for us to trust Him.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   But wait, God's trustworthiness isn't dependent on whether we know Him or not.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   So let's consider the statement this way.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   The less we know Him, the more hesitant we are to place our trust in Him,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   the more easily we will place our trust elsewhere.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Let me say that again.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   The less we know Him, the more hesitant we will be to place our trust in Him,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   the more easily we will place our trust elsewhere.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   The easier it is for then us to say,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   "Hmm, maybe we need to pull up some other seats at this table.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Maybe just for safekeeping.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Maybe I'll look somewhere else for comfort, peace, acceptance, direction, forgiveness."
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Now, let me give you an example from my own experience.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   When I was younger, I really felt God telling me that I needed to stop getting drunk.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   I was a Christian then, and I knew this was from God,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   and I could understand that this was what I needed to do, but I didn't want to.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   How could I have a better life with whatever God had planned
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   than if I just did what I wanted to do?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   I didn't know how I could fit in and make friends.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I had no idea how God was going to lead me, so it was hard and full of failure.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   It was easier for me to trust what I already knew.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   While I knew God was speaking to me, it was so hard to be focused on Him,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   to follow Him.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I could understand His way would be better,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   but there was comfort and familiarity in my own way.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   And it's important to mention that it is hard for us to trust what we don't know.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   It's also important to mention that God is at our table.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   How we react to Him being there doesn't change who He is,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   it just changes how we react to Him.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Whether or not we know Him deeply doesn't change that He is trustworthy.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   But if we are to be fixated on God so that we can more fully enjoy what He has for us,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   and we don't give the enemy a seat at our table,
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   it is vital that we are getting to know this God who we are to trust and follow.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So you may have also noticed that the title of this sermon is 'Staggered by the Mountain'.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It is based on a moment in his book where Louis discovers that he really needs to go from
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   knowing about God to knowing God.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Now, my experience is a different experience and a different process,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   but really a point in my life where I realised I need to go from knowing about God to knowing God.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   I realised I couldn't just take what God had said and do it on my own.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I needed to walk with Him, go to Him in failure.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   I needed to accept His grace and forgiveness and walk alongside Him.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I needed to taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It was then I was more easily able to trust and follow Him.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Now, this doesn't guarantee us no problems or failures,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   but we can know more deeply His grace, comfort and boldness that we see in Psalm 23.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It then goes from something we recite to ourselves to remind us of God's goodness,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   to one we declare as we experience that He is good.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   We can go from, 'Valley of death, but God is with me, God is with me'
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   to 'I will fear no evil, for God is with me'.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   And as we know Him more deeply and since they fixated on Him,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   we can come to know more deeply His goodness, grace, forgiveness and love.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Now, maybe this gives us a sinking feeling like,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   'Oh, I find it really hard to trust God. Do I really even know Him?'
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   But let me be clear, this is not a message of guilt about knowing God enough.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   This is a message of excitement and encouragement.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   It's actually amazing that we can get to know this star-breathing Creator of the Universe in this way,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   walking alongside in deep one-to-one relationship, just as David did.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And I'll let you in on a secret, we all need to work on this.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   This is a process for all of us.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Getting to know God in this way isn't overnight.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   And some of us may find it harder than others.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And there may be some moments of rapid growth.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   But even for David, this was a process.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   We often think of David as bursting onto the scene
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   and taking down Goliath in this amazing act of faith.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   In 1 Samuel 16, we are first introduced to David and the next chapter, boom, down goes Goliath.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Amazing. What an act of faith. And it was.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   But let's look at 1 Samuel 17 37.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   "And David said, 'The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.'
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And Saul said to David, 'Go, and the Lord be with you.'"
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Before Goliath, David had been building up his trust in God for years
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   as he had seen Him working and protecting him.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   His journey didn't start with this giant event that we all know.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   So whether you're just exploring or new to faith or have been following God for years,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   be encouraged that we can continue to know Him more deeply
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   and that this is a process for all of us.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   So when He is with us in the presence of our enemies,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   we don't just know that He is good, but we know that He is good.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   We can trust Him enough to be fixated on Him wholly
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   and we don't give the enemy a seat at our table.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Okay, well, that's all exciting, but maybe sounds a little bit lofty.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   So let's get practical.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   How do we actually move along this process from knowing about God
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   to really knowing God and having deep relationship with Him?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Now, we need to learn about God, have community around Him,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   and dialogue with Him.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So we need to learn about God, have community around God,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   and work on our dialogue with God through praise, confession, and practicing trust.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   So let's look at learning about God.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Now, you may be thinking, after this whole spiel
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   from going to knowing about God to knowing God,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   is this guy actually just say that?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   But this is not a contradictory statement.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Part of the process of getting to know God is to be actively learning about Him.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   When I started dating Mel and she told me things about her
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   such as, "I was born in Canada," or, "I'm training in intensive care,"
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   my response wasn't to say, "That's irrelevant.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   I'm trying to get to know you, not about you."
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   It's part of it.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   As we get to know God deeply and personally,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   this doesn't mean we stop learning about God and His character,
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   but it does mean we actually experience Him and know His character more deeply.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   We need to be pursuing a deeper understanding of God and His character.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   In his book, Louis Giglio lays out a great example of this.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Let's look at Isaiah 6, 2-3.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   We see six-winged angels called seraphim
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   that are covering their feet and faces crying out,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty."
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   We can see this and see that God is holy.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Already we have a truth about God.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   He is holy, set apart, and sacred.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   But we can go deeper.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   These angelic beings are covering their faces and feet.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   They're so in awe of God that they can't even look at Him
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   and they're covering feet in honour of Him.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   And they are crying out, "Holy, holy, holy."
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Now, why are they saying this three times?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Surely once is enough, right?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   As we see in Hebrew, when a word is repeated, it doubles the emphasis.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   To see this repeated three times is actually extremely rare.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   So we have these angelic beings so in awe of God,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   crying out, not just to say He is holy,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   but He is holy, times holy, times holy again.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   He is holy, holy, holy.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Now, this is just one example.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   We're just scratching the surface.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   But the step of learning more about God and learning His character
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   is vital in knowing Him.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   As we come to see and know more of His character,
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   we come to see who it is that we are to place our trust in.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   So what does this mean for us practically?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   This might simply mean for some of us that we need to read the Bible.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   If this is a hard habit to build,
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   signing up to a reading plan on a Bible app can be a really, really helpful thing.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Now, this may mean we need to start actively memorising Scriptures,
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   writing them on our hearts.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   And it may mean we need to start looking at some of the commentaries,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   getting deeper into what these texts are saying.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   So let's look at having community around Him.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Now, I'm a guitarist.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   A lot of what I have learnt has been through my own practice.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   But the expertise and experience from other musicians
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   has been invaluable to my own growth.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   In sharing my joy and knowledge of the instrument,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   I strengthen what I know, sometimes through correction from others.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   But I also learn from their knowledge and their experiences.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And through this, I gain a deeper understanding about the guitar.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   I get to know my instrument better.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Now, the same is true for when we come together with others
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   and walk with each other in our faith.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   This is what God is doing in my life.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Wow, so great to hear how God has come through for you.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   God is teaching me this right now.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   We grow with God as we walk together with Him,
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   learning more about Him and witnessing Him working in each other's lives.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   So practically, what can we do here?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Get that community.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Get involved in a clan if you're not already.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Find a prayer partner, someone who you share with.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   This is something I've been doing with a friend of mine in Australia
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   for a number of years, and it has honestly been one of the most
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   beneficial things in my journey with God.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   And lastly, in your family life,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   prioritise and be intentional about walking with God with your family.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   And so, the third is working on our dialogue with God.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   As we do life with God, we get to know Him more.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   So how does that look actually?
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   The truth is that it's us who needs to get to know Him more.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   He already knows us deeply, but He desires for us to let Him in.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   This Psalm 23 has brought so many, so much comfort in so many dark times.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   So let's take a look at some other examples that David has left
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   through his Psalms with his dialogue with God.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Now this is a three-parter.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   We're going to look at praise, confession, and practising our trust in Him.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   So let's look firstly at praising God.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   What a surprise, the worship leader says we need to spend more time in praise.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Which, yes, but through music is just one way we praise God.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   We need to be giving Him thanks and acknowledging who He is.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Now let's take a look at Psalm 145, 1-4.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   And this one we're going to read out together,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   and really take note of the words as we speak them out.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Let's go.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   "I will exalt you, my God the King.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I will praise your name forever and ever.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Every day I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   His greatness no one can fathom.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   One generation commands your works to another.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   They tell of your mighty acts."
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   This actually goes on for 17 more verses.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I mean, can you imagine just sitting and writing out all of this praise to God?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   So why is this praise so important?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   In his praise, David is acknowledging who God is.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Look at verse 1.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   "I will exalt you, my God the King."
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   Now remember, David was literally a king.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   So as David puts God in this position, he's humbling himself and exalting God.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   God is king.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   With that praise coming out, we can't justify following our own way.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   We can't justify clinging on to the enemies around us
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   as we proclaim that God is king.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Throughout the Psalm, David also speaks of his character.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   "Greatness no one can fathom.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Mighty acts.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Gracious and compassionate.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Slow to anger.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Rich in love."
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Calling out his character, who he is.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   We see this also reflected, actually, when Jesus teaches us how to pray in Matthew 6,
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   where he starts off with, "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name."
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   He's acknowledging who he's praying to, our Father in heaven, and praises him.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Hallowed, meaning wholly consecrated.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   How could I not want to follow this God?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   I want to know this God more and more.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   I want to be in deep relationship with this God.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   I want to experience this God.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   His ways are far greater than mine.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   This is a God I can trust.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Here we see David actually praising upon the mountaintop.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   We'll get to praising the valley, don't worry about that.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   But like David, we also need to be praising God when we're on the mountaintops.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Because equally in those moments, we need to remember who is king, and that is God.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   But David didn't just have these moments of praise boxed in their own little corner.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Never to be seen amongst struggles and fear or repentance.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   But this carried with him in all sorts of circumstances.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   So practically, what are we going to do?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   We need to make praise a regular part of our dialogue with God.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   In our prayers to God, call out his character.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Praise him for who he is, prioritize it.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Before we get to, "Please help me, and I'm struggling with this."
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Praise him in the good times and the bad.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Get the relationship right with God, that he is good, that he is holy, and that he is king.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Starting with our prayer life.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   Now my challenge to you is this.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Set aside some time in prayer to just praise him.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Speak of his goodness, call out his character.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   But set aside some time where the only thing you do is praise him.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Now the second is confession.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Often when we fail, and what I know from experience, one of the prominent voices we hear is,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   "Really? After that? After failing yet again?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   You're going to come to God as if you're still some sort of Christian?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   I don't think he wants to hear from you."
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Now let me be clear, this is a lie.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Sometimes I would believe this lie, but what we must do is to ignore that lie and run to God.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   When we fail, the only place to run to is God.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   There's nothing you can do that will make God not want to hear from you.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Again, there is nothing you can do that will make God not want to hear from you.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Now let's look at some of Psalm 51,
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   which is a Psalm written by David after he was confronted by the prophet Nathan for adultery and murder.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   according to your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   For I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   So you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge."
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   What David had done was horrible, yet even he is able to come to God, confess, receive forgiveness,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   and not be defined by these sins, but by who he is in God.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And God already knew his sins.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   He sent the prophet to tell David so that David was aware of them.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   But by bringing his sins to God, David doesn't just know that God is forgiving,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   but he knows God's forgiveness.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Look closely as David confesses.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   "According to your unfailing love, according to your great compassion,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge."
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   As we go on to verse 14 and 15.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Through his confession, David is praising God, calling out his character.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   In verse 14 and 15, we see that with God's forgiveness, David knows that he can praise God freely.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   And notice what it's not.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   "I'll praise you, but I'll still remember all my sins and that I'm horrible and that I'm inadequate."
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   It's not that at all.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   This does not take David back to square one in his relationship with God.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Again, this doesn't take David back to square one in his relationship with God.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   And this is why our praise is also so important here in confessing our sins.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   If I hold myself as king, I still fall short.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   I don't deserve God's forgiveness.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   But if God is king and God is Lord, I am forgiven fully.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   So what do we do?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   We need to come in confession to God regularly.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   It doesn't just have to be the big ones.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   My challenge to you is to make this tangible.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Write them out or say them out loud.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   They don't have to be adultery or murder.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   We all need to have time of confession to God.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   Praise Him as you do so and then receive and know His forgiveness.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   And lastly, we need to practice trusting God.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Now this is a little bit like the chicken or the egg.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Well, does knowing God help me trust Him or does trusting God help me know Him?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And the answer is really both.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   So now remember, whether or not we place our trust in God does not determine whether or not He is trustworthy.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   He is.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   But this is precisely why we want to know Him more.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   That we may find it easier to place our trust in Him and walk with Him.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   We all know what it's like to be in those places where we don't know what God is doing.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   Where we can't see what's ahead of us.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Now let's take a look at my personal favourite psalm, Psalm 13.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   "How long, Lord, will you forget me forever?
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   How long will you hide your face from me?
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and day after day have sorrow in my heart?
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   How long will my enemy triumph over me?
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   Look on me and answer, Lord my God.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Give light to my eyes or I will sleep in death.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And my enemy will say, 'I have overcome him.'
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   My foes will rejoice when I fall.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   But I trust in your unfailing love.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   My heart rejoices in your salvation.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   I will sing the Lord's praise for He has been good to me."
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   I still remember reading this for the first time and just being blown away by that shift in verse 5.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I mean, look at this brutal honesty in verses 1 to 4.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   "Will you forget me forever?
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   How long will my enemy triumph over me?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Give light to my eyes or I will sleep in death.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   David is in a heavy place.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   No one is envious of him in these four verses.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   But then within all of this, within all the frustration, uncertainty, feeling of abandonment,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   David commits to trust God.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   He remembers that the Lord is good and commits to singing his praises.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   He is vulnerable with God and he places his whole trust in Him."
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Now, he isn't a backup plan, he is the whole plan.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   And we see here praise again.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   And I want you to consider going through this without praise.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Without "God is King", we think, "Is God King?
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   I know He's helped me before, but should I get this one?"
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   We need to remember God is King.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   We need to be honest with Him in these times and trust and praise Him.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   And this is consistent with David throughout his Psalms.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Somewhere he's literally being hunted by enemies.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   But this doesn't only apply to us when we're literally being hunted.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Of Psalm 13, Charles Spurgeon says this,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   "The Psalm cannot be referred to any special event or period in David's history.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   All attempts to find it are birthplace are but guesses.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   It was doubtless more than once the language of that of much tried man of God
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   and is intended to express the feelings of the people of God
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   in those ever-returning trials which beset them."
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   This is for us in all times with that struggle,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   whether it is in lust, anger, jealousy, greed, whatever it may be.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   So what are we to do?
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   We need to be honest with God.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   He already knows everything anyway.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Looking at David in Psalm 13,
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   look at David in Psalm 13.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   With whatever is going on, we need to bring that to Him,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   lay it down at His feet and trust Him to take it.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   All of this takes practice.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Remember, this is a process for all of us.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   And this may look like, "Lord, I'm struggling so much with this sin.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   Please take this burden for me."
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Or, "Lord, I don't understand what is in front of me, but I trust in You.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   Lord, I'm so stressed out with work, but I know You are in control.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   I give these worries to You."
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Again, this can really help to make this tangible.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Write them out or speak them out loud.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And we may never solve the chicken or the egg
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   with whether trusting or knowing God comes first, but that's okay
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   because what you will find is that as you step out and place trust in God more,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   you will grow in knowing Him, and you will grow in experiencing Him,
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   and you will see that He is for you, if a band can come up.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   So I invite you on this process.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   It's an exciting one, and it's one that we will all go through together,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   of learning about God, having community around God,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   and dialoguing with Him in praise, confession, and trust.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   And then we can say with confidence, with joy, from a place of knowing God deeply,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   "I praise Him for He is good. He has forgiven my sins.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   I trust Him in the good times and the bad, and I have seen Him come through.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Even when I am surrounded by all of my enemies,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   He is the only one at my table, and I am fixated on Him.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   I know God, and I trust Him."
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Let me pray.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Lord, we thank You that You are a good God.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   You are holy. You are worthy of praise.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   You are worthy of all trust, Lord.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   We thank You that we have this opportunity to walk in relationship
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   with this God who created the universe, Lord,
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   from the big, massive stars to every single little piece of sand on the shores.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And we thank You, Lord, that You are not a distant God,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   but You are a God who reaches out to us, who comes to us.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   Lord, You sent Your Son to die for us so we may be forgiven for our sins.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   We thank You that You are a God who wants to be in deep relationship with us.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   And Lord, we cry out that we want to get to know You more, Lord.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   We repent of the times that we struggle to trust You, Lord,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   and we repent of the times when we would rather be doing something else.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   But Lord, help us to just run to You in all circumstances
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   and get to know You more deeply, Lord.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And we ask that You'll be revealing Yourself to us more and more, Lord.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   And we thank You that You are doing that, Lord.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Help us to recognise You working,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   that we, in all circumstances, can know that You are with us,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   that You are God,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   and that You are the only one we need at our table.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   We pray this in Your name. Amen.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
