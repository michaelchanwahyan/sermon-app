00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,240
 Good evening KFCI. I'm sad to not be with you in person. Sandra and I are in the UK

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:20,240
 with her father who is sick. We've been so grateful for your love and your prayers. Thank

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,960
 you KFCI. Bonnie told us last week that Advent, the season we find ourselves in, means coming.

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,920
 That begs the question, who is coming? Of course the answer is Jesus. And what are we

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:48,080
 to do? We are to get ready. Between now and Christmas we will be taking a hard look and

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:56,760
 hopefully a fresh look at the story of Christmas. To see Jesus as the hope for the world. The

7
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,760
 only hope at a time when hopelessness seems to be the prevailing message in today's world.

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:16,740
 I have my own definition of Christmas. I put it on the screen. Somebody became nobody so

9
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:29,940
 that nobody's could become somebody's. Let me say that again. Somebody became nobody

10
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:37,920
 so that nobody's can become somebody's. I want to pick up on James's excellent point

11
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,900
 from last week. James pointed out that the main point of Christmas was not a baby in

12
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:52,860
 a manger in Bethlehem. He encouraged us to look at Christmas through the lens of a bloody

13
00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:01,460
 cross at Calvary. And even more than that, through the resurrection, a tomb that is empty

14
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:11,700
 to this very day. The King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, the High King of Heaven, somebody

15
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:20,480
 swapped his heavenly home for a dirty old manger in a filthy stable and died the horrific

16
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:36,140
 death of a common criminal to defeat the power of death once and for all. But why? Why? Well,

17
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:49,380
 so that this nobody, a sinner represented by the thief on the cross with Jesus, could

18
00:02:49,380 --> 00:03:00,740
 become somebody, could become a child of God, a son of the King. And I guess as I'm in UK

19
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:10,900
 now, a member of the Royal Family. The wonder of Christmas is this. The God chooses nobody's

20
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:19,940
 like you and me and through the life, birth, death and resurrection of his son, we can

21
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:31,300
 become somebody's if and only if we are prepared to accept what he has done for us. One of

22
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:42,820
 the best examples of a so-called nobody was Mary. Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, was

23
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:51,020
 a young girl, probably only about 12 or 13 years old when the angel Gabriel came to her.

24
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:58,820
 She had recently become engaged to a carpenter named Joseph. Mary was an ordinary Jewish

25
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:13,980
 girl looking forward to marriage. Suddenly, her life changed forever. Fearful and troubled,

26
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,920
 Mary found herself in the presence of the angel Gabriel, listening to his announcement.

27
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:27,540
 We read this, "And he came to her and said, 'Greetings, O favoured one, the Lord is with

28
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:35,880
 you.' But she was greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what sort of greeting

29
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:45,540
 this might be." Mary could never have expected to hear the most incredible news that she,

30
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:56,020
 a virgin, would have a child and her son would be the Messiah. I mean, how would you feel?

31
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:02,240
 Verse 30, "And the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found faith

32
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:10,520
 with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call

33
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:20,880
 his name Jesus.'" Although she couldn't comprehend how she would conceive the Saviour, she responded

34
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:30,560
 to God with humble belief and obedience. Although Mary's calling held great honour, it would

35
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,880
 demand great suffering too. There would be pain in childbirth, there would be pain in

36
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:46,240
 motherhood, as well as the privilege of being the mother of the Messiah.

37
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:53,680
 The angel told Mary in Luke 1:28 that she was highly favoured by God. The phrase simply

38
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,280
 meant that Mary had been given much grace or unmerited favour from God. But even with

39
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:09,880
 God's favour, Mary would still suffer much. Although she would be honoured, highly honoured

40
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:17,760
 as the mother of the Saviour, she would first know disgrace as an unwed mother. She nearly

41
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:26,920
 lost her fiancÃ©. Her beloved son was rejected and cruelly murdered. Mary's submission to

42
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:35,460
 God's plan would cost her dearly. Yet she was willing to be God's servant.

43
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,760
 God knew that Mary was a woman of true strength. She was the only human being to be with Jesus

44
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:56,240
 throughout his entire life, from birth until death. She gave birth to Jesus as her baby

45
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,760
 and watched him die as her saviour. Can I repeat that? She gave birth to Jesus as her

46
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:12,880
 baby and watched him die as her saviour. Mary also knew the scriptures when the angel appeared

47
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:20,120
 and told her the baby would be God's son. She replied this, "Behold, I am the servant

48
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:29,680
 of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word." She knew of the Old Testament

49
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:48,160
 prophecies about the Messiah. Poor and female, you might say three strikes. These qualities

50
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:56,280
 made her unsuitable in the eyes of people to be used mightily of God. A nobody, you

51
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:05,640
 might say. But God saw Mary's trust and obedience. Typically not the qualifications that humans

52
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:14,240
 consider important. God will often use the most unlikely candidates to serve him. I know

53
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:22,440
 one of them. But what lessons do we learn from this? Most importantly, Mary was willing

54
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:29,280
 to submit her life to God's plan no matter what it would cost her. Obedience to the Lord's

55
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:37,400
 will meant that Mary would be disgraced as an unwed mother. Surely she expected Joseph

56
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:44,400
 to divorce her, or worse yet, he might even have her put to death by stoning as the law

57
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:53,920
 permitted. Mary may not have considered the full extent of her future suffering. She may

58
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:02,880
 not imagine the pain of watching her beloved son bear the weight of sin and die a terrible

59
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,520
 death on the cross. But surely she knew that her life would hold many sacrifices as the

60
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,960
 mother of the Messiah. Being chosen by God for a high calling requires total commitment

61
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:24,800
 and a willingness to sacrifice everything out of love and devotion to one's Savior.

62
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:33,520
 For Mary said, "Behold, I am a servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your

63
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,760
 word."

64
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,200
 We sang, didn't we, "Mary, Did You Know?" Originally written as a Christmas play script

65
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:52,380
 by Mark Lowry in 1984. "Mary, Did You Know?" is a series of questions all aimed at asking

66
00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:01,480
 pregnant Mary various things about her soon-to-be-born son, the Messiah. I counted 17 questions,

67
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:09,000
 ranging from if she knew that her baby was God himself, to questions about his miracles.

68
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:19,480
 To answer the question, "Mary, Did You Know?" poses, yes, Mary knew. Mary knew she was having

69
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:29,880
 God's son. Luke 1, 30-33, 35 says this clearly, "And the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid,

70
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,240
 Mary, for you have found faith with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and

71
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,200
 bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son

72
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,400
 of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him to the throne of his father David. And

73
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:55,800
 he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom there will be no end.' And

74
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:02,200
 the angel answered her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High

75
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:09,800
 will overshadow you. Therefore, the child to be born will be called Holy, the Son of

76
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:19,880
 God.'" Yes, I think we can say that Mary knew that her baby boy was God himself. Even

77
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,680
 easier to answer is whether Mary consented to bear the Son of God. Her response on the

78
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,120
 subject was, "Behold, I am the servant of the Lord. Let it be to me according to your

79
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:43,800
 word." But Mary has her own Christmas song. History has given us a far more beautiful

80
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,760
 and accurate song for Christmas about Mary, one that actually confesses the truth about

81
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,920
 her, God's plan and that tiny baby. That song is the one that Mary herself sang, and

82
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,560
 it's one that churches around the world still regularly sing, the Magnificat or Song of

83
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:12,440
 Mary. And we had it read to us earlier, of course. "My soul magnifies the Lord, and my

84
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,800
 spirit rejoices in God my Saviour, for he has looked on the humble estate of his servant.

85
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,700
 For behold, from now on all generations will call me blessed, for he who is mighty has

86
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,640
 done great things for me, and holy is his name, and his mercy is for those who fear

87
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:39,400
 him from generation to generation. He has shown strength with his arm. He has scattered

88
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,920
 the proud in the thoughts of their hearts. He has brought down the mighty from their

89
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,520
 thrones and exalted those of humble estate. He has filled the hungry with good things,

90
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,040
 and the rich he has sent away empty. He has helped his servant Israel in remembrance of

91
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:05,760
 his mercy, as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his offspring forever."

92
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:16,040
 This leads me to reflect on this question. Am I, like Mary, willing to accept God's plan

93
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:25,080
 no matter what the cost is? Can I go a step further and rejoice in that plan as Mary did,

94
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:32,880
 knowing it would cost me dearly? Coming back to our song, of course Mary knew.

95
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:42,600
 The question we should be asking, rather than "Mary, did you know?" is "Do we know?"

96
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:50,300
 Do we know? Could we sing Mary's song? How do we respond to God in our lives and in the

97
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,920
 world around us? Because while we wait for the birth of Jesus at Christmas, it is not

98
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,820
 because he isn't present with us now. The God who chose to dwell among us is with us

99
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:13,880
 still yesterday, today, and for all our tomorrows. Do we feel Christ in our heart? Do we recognize

100
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:22,040
 the Holy Spirit at work in our lives? Advent is a time of preparation, and perhaps this

101
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:31,340
 week we can all, all of us at KFCI, can commit to looking, listening, feeling God's presence

102
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:39,700
 still dwelling among us. So I ask you to try a little experiment. Every

103
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:48,140
 morning as you prepare for the day, say to yourself, as Mary did, "Today I will encounter

104
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:56,620
 God and my soul will magnify Christ." And as you go through the day, look for Christ

105
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:02,820
 in the eyes of those you meet. Listen for the Spirit deep in your heart and try and

106
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,300
 feel God's love and grace in the world around you, because Christ, the Holy Spirit, God

107
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,580
 is there. And at the end of the day, just before you

108
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:20,860
 turn into bed, reflect back on all you've experienced. The good and the difficult, the

109
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:27,260
 joyous and the stress-filled. Was there something that struck you? Maybe a child's smile, maybe

110
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:33,500
 the eyes of a street sleeper, the song of a bird in the tree, a kind word of gesture,

111
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:40,820
 or perhaps even just a moment of stillness amongst the clutter of Hong Kong life.

112
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:50,680
 The thing is, every day is a God-filled day, and we too are called by God to a Magnificat

113
00:15:50,680 --> 00:16:01,900
 of our own. We are called to magnify the Lord, our Christ, and rejoice, for God is with us.

114
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:09,340
 Now what does that mean? Well, we may not be giving physical birth to the Christ child,

115
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:18,900
 even you, Michelle, but we are giving birth to Him in the lives of all we encounter, if

116
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:29,700
 we magnify Him in our soul. And the crowning glory of it all is if we do this, we, KFCI,

117
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:36,260
 may just end up being the Church, the Body of Christ we are called to be. We will be

118
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:44,220
 joyous, good stewards of God, servants of the Most High. And then, the hungry will be

119
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,260
 fed, the thirsty given drink, the poor lifted and the stranger welcomed, the prisoner and

120
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,960
 the sick will be visited, and the dream of God for us all, for all the earth, will be

121
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:05,900
 ever closer to reality. Then we will all sing our own song of God's presence in our lives.

122
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:16,980
 The pop music world asks, "Mary, did you know?" We say, "Of course she did!" But the question

123
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:30,660
 we should ask is, "Do we?" Do we? Mary said, "Behold, I am a servant of the Lord. Let it

124
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:44,580
 be to me according to your word." Can we say the same thing? Just while the band gets up

125
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:52,400
 to play the next song, I invite you just to close your eyes. I just invite you just to

126
00:17:52,400 --> 00:18:08,720
 reflect on this. And I ask you a question. Do we know? Do we know the presence and power

127
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:18,220
 of God in our life? The one who was a baby in a manger in Bethlehem, who went on to die

128
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:26,640
 on a cross for you and me, who rose from the dead that we might be free of sin, and who

129
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:42,960
 sends his Holy Spirit to be with us now. Father God, let it be to me according to your

130
00:18:42,960 --> 00:19:00,880
 word. Behold, I am your servant. Fill me with your Holy Spirit and help me this Christmas

131
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:16,360
 to realize you are always present in my life. I bless you in Jesus' name. Amen. Thank you

132
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,560
 and I hope to see you very, very soon. God bless.
