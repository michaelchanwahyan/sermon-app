1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 And we have been going through the series called Charged.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 And Pastor James did a great job of going through

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,160
 chapter one with us, talking about

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,200
 what would love have me do, right?

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,000
 If God is love, what would love have me do

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 in different situations, in tough situations?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,800
 What would God have me do?

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,800
 The second thing, the second part that we went through

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,000
 was with Pastor Michelle.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And she talked about the truth, upholding the truth.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 What is true understanding, true experience

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 so that we can have, so that we can be

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 the true vessel of God and share His word

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 to those around us.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 And in the second chapter of 1 Timothy,

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 we are going through prayer today, prayer.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 And Paul talks about different types of prayer.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 He talks about the purpose of prayer,

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 who prayers are, who is praying.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 He talks about the purpose of prayer, who prayer is for,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 the ultimate purpose, the ultimate goal of prayer.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 And lastly, our attitude towards prayer.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 And so at the beginning on the call to worship,

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 we read this verse, right?

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Where Paul was urging Timothy, Paul was urging Timothy,

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 first of all, the petitions, prayers, intercessions,

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 thanksgiving be made for all people.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And so Paul, first of all, is talking about

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 different types of prayer, right?

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 What are some of the things that you pray for

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 on a daily basis?

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 What are different types of prayer you,

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 what are the things you pray for?

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Shout it out, come on.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You don't pray?

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You don't pray?

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 What do you pray for?

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 What do you pray for?

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Help, what else?

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Huh?

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Protection, shoes, James wants more shoes.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 (audience laughing)

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 The first thing that Paul says

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 is that we pray for supplication, right?

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Or in the other version, it's called petitions.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And supplication is just God,

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 supply us with the things that we need, right?

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 We need help, we need shoes.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 God, help us.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 (laughing)

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Maybe too many shoes now.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 God, we have too many shoes, help us.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Another form of prayer is intercession.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Who's prayed for somebody that is in need this week?

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Who's prayed for somebody in need?

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Maybe we have friends that are sick.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Maybe you have friends that are going through

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 some emotional needs,

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 who are going through something hard in life.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 We pray for people on a daily basis.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Intercession, Thanksgiving,

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 what are you guys thankful for?

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Health, what else?

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Food, who said food?

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Are you guys thinking about food already, huh?

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 (laughing)

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 What are you guys thankful for?

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 What else?

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Friendship, family, Thanksgiving.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Paul is saying when we gather together,

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 let's pray.

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Let's pray for God to meet our needs.

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Let's pray that God would help our friends and our family.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Let's thank God for the things that he's done in our life.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Back when I was in university and I was leading a group,

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 we committed ourselves to having prayer meeting every day.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 9 a.m. in our office.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 These are some of the students

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 and I couldn't make it that day,

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 and so they're showing me a photo that they were praying.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And we started off that day with prayer.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 We're giving up the day, offering it to the Lord.

83
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 We would pray and thank God for who he is.

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 We would pray and confess.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 We would thank God for the things he's done.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 And then we would pray for the world.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 We would pray for the world.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 The Koreans have really made it a focus of their ministry.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Who has some friends that are Korean?

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 In Toronto, there's a lot of Koreans.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 And what they're sort of really focused on

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 is prayer in the morning.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 They would come together at the dawn of day, at 6 a.m.,

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 to pray together.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Now, that might not be the generation now.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 It might be the generation, you know,

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 the younger generation.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 No, no, not the younger generation.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 The young and the younger generation.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So not the younger generation, but the young generation.

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 They came to pray every day, sometimes 4 or 5 a.m.

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 The Koreans really focused on prayer.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 And Paul wants us to focus on prayer too.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And why should we pray?

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 What is the purpose of prayer?

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Who should we be praying for?

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 He says that we need to pray for all men.

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Everyone needs to be prayed for.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 All people need to be prayed for.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Now, those who work in youth,

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 who has worked in youth before,

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 or university students or whatnot,

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 you love it.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 You know, when you come together in a group,

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 and at the end, you wanna pray together,

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 and you ask these kids,

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 "Oh, what do you want us to pray for you?"

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And sometimes they say, "I'm good."

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Have you guys gotten that before?

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 I'm good, right?

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I'm good.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 Like, God, I'm good.

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And so I tell them, "Yeah, let's pray for your perfect life.

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 "Let's pray for your perfect life without sin,

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 "without conflict,

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 "'cause, you know, obviously,

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 "you need especially, you need especially,

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 "you especially need prayer."

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 Sorry.

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 Sorry, I got tongue twisted there.

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Paul goes on and says this to us,

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 "But we need to pray for kings

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 "and all those in authority,

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 "that we may live peaceful and quiet lives

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 "in all godliness and holiness."

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 And so Paul was obviously writing this letter to Timothy.

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 And as Pastor James explained to us, he was in Ephesus.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 And in Ephesus,

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 who was sort of in charge at that time, it was Rome.

140
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 It was Caesar.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 And the Christians, a lot of times, they had conflict,

142
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 because Caesar was supposed to be like God, right?

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 And so if you didn't follow exactly what Caesar did,

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 you were disobeying their God.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And so the Christians had conflict, right?

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 They didn't always follow what Caesar said.

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 And so because of that, Paul is urging them to pray.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 Paul is urging them to pray for their leaders,

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 that they may live peaceful and quiet lives

150
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 in godliness and holiness.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 Back then, Paul's urge to them

152
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 was to live peaceful and quiet lives

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 in godliness and holiness.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And obviously, we all have political leaders that we love,

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 or sometimes we're not really agreeing with.

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 But Paul is asking us, God is asking us,

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 that we pray for our leaders.

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 We pray for our leaders.

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 The standard he sets here is this,

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 that we may live lives of godliness and holiness.

161
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 And so how can we live lives of godliness and holiness

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 in our situation?

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 And we need to be sensitive to the Spirit,

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 how the Spirit leads us,

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 so that we can live godly and holy lives for the Lord.

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Next, Paul tells us of the ultimate goal of prayer.

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 And it says in verse five, right?

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Verse four, and then verse three and four, and then five.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 "This is good and pleases God our Savior,

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 "who wants all people to be saved

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 "and come to the knowledge of the truth."

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Paul, first of all, says, this is good and it pleases God.

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 The ultimate goal of prayer is to please God.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Does God know everything?

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 Does He know what you're gonna pray before you pray it?

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 He does.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 He does.

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 But God wants us to have a relationship with Him,

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 connect with Him on a daily basis.

180
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Yes, He knows what we're gonna pray.

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 He knows our need.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 He is a Father

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 that will guide us, protect us.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Even the sparrows are well-fed.

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Even the flowers are more beautiful than anything

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 that is dressed,

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 any of Solomon's dresses or outfits.

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 God knows our need,

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 but He wants us to pray because it pleases Him

190
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 to connect with Him.

191
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 And the second thing is,

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 "For there is one God and one mediator

193
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 "between God and mankind,

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 "the man Christ Jesus,

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 "who gave Himself as a ransom for all people."

196
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Jesus gave Himself for us.

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 The ultimate goal of prayer

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 is that people would be saved, all would be saved,

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 and to come to the knowledge of the truth,

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 that Jesus is the truth,

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 the way, the life, and the truth.

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 There is no other way to Jesus, to the Father,

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 except through Him.

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Jesus is our mediator.

205
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 He gave up Himself

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 so that we could connect with the Father.

207
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 And so we need to be praying

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 for people to come to know Jesus.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Have you guys been praying

210
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 for some of your friends and your family

211
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 to come to know Jesus?

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 Have you?

213
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Yes.

214
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 I remember back in university

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 and we had this Christian group.

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Every year we would set a goal.

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 We wanna be praying.

218
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 For example, we wanna see 50 students

219
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 come to know Jesus this school semester.

220
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 And so we would pray every week

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 that students would come to know Jesus diligently.

222
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 And we would pray that through our events,

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 whether it be a "Does God exist?" debate,

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 whether it be a "Can a scientist believe in God?" event,

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 or just one-on-one going out and doing good work

226
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 and social events,

227
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 that people would come to know Jesus,

228
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 students would come to know Jesus.

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 And that's what we did when we were in university.

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 We prayed diligently

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 for students to come to know Jesus.

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 And Paul is charging Timothy

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 that when they gather together, when they pray,

234
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 their ultimate goal

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 must be that people would come to know Jesus,

236
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 that all would be saved,

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 come to the knowledge of the truth,

238
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 and that there is only one mediator,

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 and that is Jesus himself.

240
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Next, he talks about the attitude of prayer.

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 And let's read together verse eight to 10.

242
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Let's read together.

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 One, two, three.

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 (audience chattering)

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 "Lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 "I also want the women to dress modestly

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 "with decency and propriety,

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 "adorning themselves not with elaborate hairstyles

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 "or gold or pearls, expensive clothes,

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 "but all goodies appropriate for women

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 "to profess to worship God."

252
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 All right, so now we're going to a part of the passage

253
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 that is a bit more tricky.

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 Now, the passage after this, the end of the chapter,

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 there's some controversy to it,

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 the different roles of men and women in the church.

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 Now, today, our focus will be on prayer.

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 We don't have enough time to address the roles specifically,

259
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 but we're gonna just focus on the prayer aspect of it.

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And so we're just gonna go through this section of it.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And what Paul is doing here is he is focusing

262
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 on some of the concerns of the different genders of that day.

263
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 So firstly, with men, he's telling them to lift holy hands.

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 Right, lift holy hands and pray without anger or disputing.

265
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Now, in the Old Testament, they lifted holy hands.

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 They lifted hands when they prayed, right?

267
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Ezra did that, David did that in the temple.

268
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 Lifting holy hands is a sign of surrender,

269
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 devotion to the Lord, right?

270
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Holy hands are, we need to set apart our lives for the Lord.

271
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 The problem with some of the men of that time was that

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 they dealt with anger, okay?

273
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 They were dealing with anger.

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Some of them were very self-righteous.

275
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 They had to be right.

276
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 You know, sort of like our (speaks in foreign language)

277
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 Right, we need to be men, we are always right.

278
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Right, and so some of the problems of that time

279
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 during Timothy and Paul was that these men sometimes

280
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 would pray prayers that would be angry prayers, right?

281
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 Oh, Lord, forgive James for not passing me the ball

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 at basketball.

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Forgive him, Lord, repent.

284
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Help him to repent of his ways.

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 They had to be right, you know?

286
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 The Greeks and especially some of those philosophers

287
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 and theologians, philosophers back then,

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 they wanted to be right.

289
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 That's what they strived for.

290
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And sometimes they would use prayer

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 to go against the other person they were disputing.

292
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 And they would use prayer to make themselves right.

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And so Paul is saying, no, lift yourself up with holy hands

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 and pray to the Lord, surrender to the Lord.

295
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Don't use prayer to win your arguments.

296
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 Don't use prayer to start disputes.

297
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 Prayer should be focused on the Lord.

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 Prayer should be focused on the Lord.

299
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 And so that was what Paul was encouraging

300
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 the men of that time to do.

301
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Now, he continues and says that the women

302
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 should dress modestly with decency and propriety.

303
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 Decency and propriety.

304
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 And so some of the women of that time,

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 maybe they were really well-dressed, right?

306
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 Elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls, expensive clothes.

307
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 Now, if you come to church nowadays with braids

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 or what is it again?

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Sorry, elaborate hairstyles, gold, pearls.

310
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 We wouldn't think that much of it, right?

311
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I mean, that's sort of normal.

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 People wear gold chains, people have interesting hairstyles.

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 I mean, it's true.

314
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 Some people wear expensive clothes.

315
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 Some people wear expensive...

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 I don't know whose hairstyle is more elaborate

317
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 or I don't know.

318
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 That can be up to interpretation.

319
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 So Paul is reminding the women of that time.

320
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Maybe they were coming, it was like a red carpet

321
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 every time they went to church, right?

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 They wore all their best dresses

323
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 and all the craziest hairstyles, elaborate hairstyles.

324
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 Maybe it was like, you know, the Emmy Awards

325
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 every time they went to prayer meeting

326
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 or something like that.

327
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 So Paul was reminding the women.

328
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 It's not about outer appearance.

329
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 It's about God.

330
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 And so what does propriety mean?

331
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 It means, is it proper, right?

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Is it appropriate for the meeting?

333
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 Am I overdressed or underdressed?

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 Is it gonna cause inappropriate attention to myself?

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 So Paul is reminding the women of that time,

336
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 propriety, decency and modesty.

337
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 Is it moderate?

338
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 Is it too much or too little?

339
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Where is the middle ground?

340
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And, you know, sometimes we have to remind our youth

341
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
 at the youth service, you know, to dress modestly

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 'cause the trends of this world, you know,

343
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 are not super modest nowadays.

344
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 And so is he, is Paul saying,

345
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 "No, you gotta dress ugly."

346
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 You know, is that what Paul is saying?

347
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 No, Paul is not saying you gotta come ugly and not ugly.

348
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 Paul is saying, "Dress appropriately.

349
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 "Use the wisdom that God has given you.

350
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 "Be led by the Holy Spirit."

351
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And these things were especially addressed

352
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 to men and women of that time.

353
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 But actually it could go both ways, right?

354
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 Men, you need to dress decently as well.

355
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 How would it be if I just came on stage unbuttoned

356
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 and preached the sermon?

357
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 Would it be modest?

358
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 Would it be decent?

359
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 No.

360
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Men also have to practise, right?

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 He agrees, you know, yeah.

362
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Right, men also have to go through this, right?

363
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Women, you know, sometimes you could be angry

364
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 in prayer as well, I'm not sure.

365
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Ask him.

366
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Paul is addressing these things

367
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 specifically for those people at those times.

368
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 But his ultimate goal

369
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 is that he wants our attitude to be fixed on God,

370
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 not ourselves.

371
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 When we meet together to pray,

372
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 it shouldn't be about disputing.

373
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 It shouldn't be about, you know,

374
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 causing gossip, causing gossip.

375
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 It shouldn't be about, oh, I gotta be

376
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 the most well-dressed person in this prayer meeting

377
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 or I have to have the most elaborate hairstyle

378
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 in this meeting.

379
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 Our focus when we pray together,

380
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 as we come together in worship,

381
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 is that we be fixed on Jesus Christ.

382
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Amen?

383
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Amen.

384
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
 And so we've gone through prayer today,

385
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 the different types of prayer,

386
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 the purpose of prayer.

387
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 We pray for men, we pray for our leaders.

388
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 We seek God's guidance in how we be Christians

389
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 in this time, in this age.

390
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Our ultimate goal of prayer is to please God.

391
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 Is to have our friends and our family

392
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 and people come to know Jesus.

393
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 And lastly, our attitude towards prayer

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 should be focused on him.

395
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 Not on ourselves, not on winning disputes,

396
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 not on gossiping, not on how amazing we're dressed.

397
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 Our eyes need to be fixed on Jesus when we pray.

398
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And that should be our attitude.

399
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 That should be our attitude.

400
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 And so as we conclude,

401
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 let me ask you a question.

402
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 How is your prayer life?

403
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 How is your prayer life?

404
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Are you praying more to God?

405
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Or are you depending more on yourself?

406
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 Are you praying more to God?

407
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Or are you depending more on yourself?

408
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 Hudson Saylor has this quote.

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 "When we work, we work.

410
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 "When we pray, God works."

411
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 You guys all know I'm a doer.

412
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 I've said this many times.

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 I love doing many things, right?

414
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 Whether it be ministry,

415
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 or be in this fellowship, that fellowship,

416
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 this fellowship, that fellowship,

417
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 share the gospel here, whatever.

418
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Do a lot of things, do a lot of sports, right?

419
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And the problem with doing

420
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 is that I sometimes forget about why I'm doing it

421
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 and who I'm depending on to do these things.

422
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 And I need to stop myself

423
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 when I'm doing too much,

424
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 especially when I'm doing too much,

425
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 to sit down and connect with the person

426
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 that is seeking after me.

427
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I'm chasing all these different things,

428
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 but the one person that is chasing after me is God.

429
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 And we need to connect with God.

430
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 In such a busy city, with busy schedules,

431
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 we need to connect with God and humble ourselves.

432
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Prayer is us humbling ourselves before an infinite God

433
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 and saying that we need you, God.

434
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 We surrender ourselves to you.

435
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 We depend on you to provide for us.

436
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 We depend on you for protecting our families.

437
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 We depend on you ultimately for salvation,

438
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 for what you've done on the cross.

439
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 Are you depending on yourself more

440
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 than you are praying to God and connecting with him?

441
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And lastly, is the ultimate goal of our prayers

442
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 the salvation of others?

443
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 Have we been praying for our friends, our family,

444
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 our loved ones, our leaders,

445
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 that they would come to know Jesus?

446
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 Have we been praying for them?

447
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 I remember my dad, right?

448
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 He was the first to know Jesus in our family.

449
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And when he was in high school,

450
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 he had a calling from God to go into seminary.

451
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 And my grandmother was just like, "Don't go, don't go."

452
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And my dad, and grandfather,

453
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 dad was like threatening to kick him out of the house.

454
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 "Don't go."

455
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 My dad chose to follow Jesus,

456
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 to follow God, go to seminary.

457
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 And it wasn't until 15 or 20 years later

458
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 that my grandparents came to know Jesus

459
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 when they came to visit us in Canada.

460
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 God has his time and his way.

461
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Are we trusting in him more than we trust ourselves?

462
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 Let's invite the worship team to come up.

463
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 Before we respond,

464
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 before we respond in song,

465
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 I just want to take some time for us to pray.

466
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 If you've depended on yourself too much,

467
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 you've forgotten God,

468
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 let it be a time where you just confess,

469
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 "God, this is where I'm at.

470
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 "You know my heart, you know my weaknesses.

471
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 "Just confess it to the Lord."

472
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Or maybe God has placed somebody on your heart

473
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 that really needs Jesus.

474
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 That God would open up opportunities

475
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 for you to connect with them about Jesus, about God.

476
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Maybe bring them to Alpha.

477
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Maybe help them to try church one time.

478
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
 Let's spend some time with our creator

479
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 and just connect with Him in prayer.

480
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:54,000
