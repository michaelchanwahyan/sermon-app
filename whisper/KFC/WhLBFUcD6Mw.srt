1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,960
 I have the privilege of sharing the Word of God

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,880
 with you today, feeling a little bit insecure

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,160
 because the speaker from last week ended with a rap

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,960
 and I am not gonna be able to do that

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,720
 and she has some self-designed slides

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,620
 and mine are gonna be just black on white,

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,920
 so feeling very insecure right now,

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,920
 but praying that actually as we go through this chapter

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,680
 of 2 Timothy 3, that the Lord will be able

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,920
 to open up to you something.

12
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,320
 I mean, that was a tough chapter to read, wasn't it?

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,440
 If you have a look at what Paul was saying to Timothy,

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,800
 it wasn't good.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,800
 That first verse really hits you, but understand this.

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,960
 Understand this, in the last days

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,680
 there will be times of difficulty.

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,880
 And we just really appreciate the heart

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,640
 behind what Paul is saying here.

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,000
 So as Johnny told us a couple weeks back,

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,720
 2 Timothy 3 was Paul's last letter.

22
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,960
 He's writing it in prison.

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,520
 He knows that this time he won't get out.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,680
 This will be the last time.

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,680
 And so can you just imagine just for a second,

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,360
 as he's writing this in this prison cell,

27
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,760
 knowing that he won't be going out,

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,760
 this will be the last thing that he writes to Timothy.

29
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,200
 And this is the most important thing

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,880
 he wants Timothy to remember.

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,860
 Think about the book of John, chapter 14 to 17.

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,800
 Chapter 13 is the Last Supper,

33
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,140
 and then we head into the last few chapters

34
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,360
 where Jesus heads into this monologue.

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,600
 He starts John 14 saying,

36
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,960
 "I'm the way, the truth, and the life."

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,280
 And then he ends up with John 17 with his last prayer.

38
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,920
 It's kind of like his last bit saying,

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,880
 "If you forget everything else,

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,040
 "if you forget everything I've taught you

41
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,720
 "these last three years, remember this."

42
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,320
 And so Paul writes with that same heart.

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,360
 He's telling Timothy, "I'm gonna be gone soon.

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,240
 "I know that I won't get out this time.

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,000
 "And I know that you're gonna be on your own from here.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,560
 "And so therefore I want you to remember this."

47
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,240
 And so understand this.

48
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,000
 Don't just know it, but understand it deep in your heart

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
 that the last days are coming

50
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,580
 and they are going to be hard.

51
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,360
 The last days represents this period

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,240
 from the moment Jesus leaves and heads to heaven

53
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,560
 and basically all this time now until he returns.

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,760
 The apostle Peter talks about this in Acts 2

55
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,920
 where he's prophesying, quoting Joel.

56
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,680
 And he's saying, "In the last days,

57
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,360
 "young men will dream dreams."

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,120
 And so we are in the last days right now

59
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
 and Paul is telling Timothy and we are being told

60
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,720
 that in these last days, times will be hard.

61
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,680
 Now we don't really need reminding of that.

62
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,500
 We just need to switch on the news.

63
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,360
 We just need to go to Fox News, SCMP, the BBC,

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,280
 and we will see that the times are not the easiest, right?

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,220
 But here's the thing.

66
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,220
 Every time we look at something that isn't good news,

67
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,320
 don't we still have that same sense of shock,

68
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,380
 that same sense of, "Oh, wow, bad things are happening.

69
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,560
 "They shouldn't be, they shouldn't be."

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,040
 Or every time something bad happens to us,

71
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,840
 we sometimes still have this, right?

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,480
 We have this anger and frustration,

73
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,280
 like, "Oh, this shouldn't be happening to us.

74
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,280
 "We're Christians.

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,220
 "Actually, God promised that he'll bless us

76
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,840
 "and my life will be smooth from now.

77
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,060
 "Why is my life not smooth?

78
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,240
 "Did I do something wrong?"

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,280
 But you see, that is against what the Bible teaches.

80
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,980
 Scripture says, "In the last days,

81
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,180
 "the times will be difficult."

82
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,420
 Peter talks about this in 1 Peter 4, saying,

83
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,520
 "Don't be surprised when you face fiery trials."

84
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,720
 Jesus says in John 16, "In this world, you will have," what?

85
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,200
 "Trouble, but take heart, I have overcome the world."

86
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,760
 So for us as believers, we've got to get into that mindset.

87
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,400
 Every time something goes wrong,

88
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,820
 rather than doubting God and saying,

89
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,760
 "Oh, God, why is there suffering if there is a God?

90
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,440
 "Why isn't my God making my life as smooth as possible?"

91
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,900
 Recognise that that's never what he promised.

92
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,020
 But of course, also recognise that any of the tough times

93
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,580
 that we're going through right now as Christians

94
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,500
 don't quite compare to what they were going through.

95
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,540
 It doesn't quite compare to the persecution

96
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,260
 that was happening to the early church.

97
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,220
 We gathered here today quite freely.

98
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,540
 We drove here or caught the MTR or caught the bus here,

99
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,660
 walked into Admiralty,

100
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,580
 strolled up into Firey's Finance Centre,

101
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,740
 and came in feeling relatively at peace

102
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,540
 that we're allowed to gather here,

103
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,900
 that we are going to be safe

104
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,220
 in opening the Word of God together,

105
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,900
 that we're going to be okay in singing,

106
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,000
 we're going to be okay in praying.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,860
 So we may have troubles,

108
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,780
 and who knows what the future holds,

109
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,780
 but this is not what they were going through.

110
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,260
 And you see, Paul is making it very obvious to Timothy,

111
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,360
 he's saying, "Hey, understand this.

112
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,860
 "I'm not going to be around, so I need you to remember this.

113
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,660
 "It's going to be hard.

114
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,500
 "It's going to be hard."

115
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,780
 And in this chapter, he really,

116
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,700
 we can break it down into three different parts,

117
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,940
 and he talks about three things.

118
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,180
 He talks about the problem in the future.

119
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,260
 He's saying, "I'm not going to be there

120
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,800
 "to walk with you, Timothy, so I want to warn you

121
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,100
 "and prepare you for the problem that is in the future.

122
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,360
 "Then I want to tell you that the answer to that problem

123
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,060
 "is in the past.

124
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,820
 "And finally, I want to tell you

125
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,580
 "that I want to charge you for the present.

126
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,660
 "I want to remind you what you should be doing now."

127
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,100
 So the problem in the future, the answer is in the past,

128
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,620
 and the charge for the present

129
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,660
 is what we're going to be going through.

130
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,780
 And the first one is this.

131
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,820
 What is the problem in the future?

132
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,700
 The problem, of course, is godlessness.

133
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,700
 The title of this passage is "Godlessness in the Last Days."

134
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
 And Alex just read out, and it was a mouthful,

135
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,700
 18 characteristics of what the world was going to be like.

136
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,380
 Essentially, he was describing what the world is right now.

137
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,220
 Lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive,

138
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,780
 disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless.

139
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,180
 And he goes through this whole list.

140
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,540
 He's saying, "The times are going to be difficult.

141
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,380
 "Why?

142
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,700
 "Because all these things are going to be present.

143
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,380
 "There is going to be so much godlessness in the last days,

144
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,820
 "and we're not going to be able to go through

145
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,540
 "each and every one today."

146
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,980
 But I want to just highlight something.

147
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,180
 This passage that talks about this

148
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,660
 really can be split into two.

149
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,540
 What is godlessness, or rather, what is godlessness,

150
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,780
 and how is it described by Paul in this short passage?

151
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,660
 And I can split it into two parts very generally.

152
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,260
 And one is that he talks about this misdirected love,

153
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,980
 this misdirected love that appears

154
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,700
 when there is a godless culture.

155
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,900
 And two, this misleading look that you can have.

156
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,100
 So I want to go through each of these.

157
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,740
 And so the first one is this idea of misdirected love.

158
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,580
 If you look at this whole passage of all these things,

159
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,580
 in its literary form, it's actually bookended by loves.

160
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,660
 So it's the lover of self, it's the lover of money,

161
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,220
 and at the very end of the list,

162
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,180
 it's lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.

163
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,420
 So this whole list really comes down

164
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,220
 to this concept of misdirected love.

165
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,820
 What do I mean by that?

166
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,540
 God tells us to love Him

167
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,740
 with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.

168
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,100
 He said, "Don't love anything else to that same level."

169
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,940
 Why?

170
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,780
 Because if you love anything else, it has the potential,

171
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,220
 it has the power to corrupt you.

172
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,500
 It has the power to be destructive,

173
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,180
 even if it is a good thing.

174
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,060
 Of course, it starts off with the first one saying,

175
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,140
 lover of self, lover of money.

176
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,540
 Again, we've talked about this before,

177
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,780
 this issue in this society, this godless society

178
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,460
 that loves money, sex, and power.

179
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,420
 And He's saying, if you love any of those things,

180
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,140
 they have the power to corrupt you,

181
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,100
 they have the power to destroy you.

182
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,260
 You see, we are all built to love.

183
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,340
 We can't help it.

184
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,780
 Even those who aren't very romantic,

185
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,300
 we are built to love, we are built to worship something.

186
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,900
 The only question here is, what are you loving?

187
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,940
 What are you worshipping?

188
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,660
 You see, when it is the wrong thing,

189
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,700
 when it is a misdirected kind of love,

190
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,060
 then it becomes, then you're leading on a path

191
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,660
 towards godlessness.

192
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,500
 Why?

193
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,780
 If we just summarise those misdirected loves

194
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,260
 into those three general things, money, sex, and power,

195
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,660
 what do they all really represent?

196
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,100
 What are you actually loving

197
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,540
 when you love those three things?

198
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,580
 What causes you to be proud, to be unholy,

199
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,340
 to be disobedient to your parents?

200
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,980
 Our love of money, sex, and power, why is it problematic?

201
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,740
 Because all of those loves

202
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,620
 really reflect this desire to be in control.

203
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,100
 You love money because you wanna be in control

204
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,660
 of your own life.

205
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,380
 You wanna be able to do whatever you want to do.

206
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,220
 You wanna have control over the people

207
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,940
 in whatever way you want to.

208
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,740
 That's the love of power as well.

209
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,220
 The love of sex, this love of pleasure

210
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,220
 that's talked about again, it's about you

211
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,780
 wanting to assume and maintain and hold onto control.

212
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:32,060
 Our love for control is this misdirected love

213
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,700
 where God's saying, "No."

214
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,420
 Well, one, you recognise that you will never truly be

215
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,060
 in control, but he says, "Look at me, love me.

216
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,740
 "I'm the only one that won't corrupt you.

217
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,860
 "I am the only one who will complete you."

218
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,940
 So don't have this misdirected kind of love

219
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,060
 because when you love control,

220
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,820
 you're basically saying, "I want to be God."

221
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,700
 So then there's no surprise, the result is godlessness.

222
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,780
 Do we get that?

223
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,780
 When you love control and love all these things,

224
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,860
 you're basically saying that, "I want to be God."

225
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,260
 And so therefore, it's no surprise when our lives

226
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,980
 or when our society is filled with godlessness.

227
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,740
 So that's the first one, misdirected love.

228
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,300
 And the second one is this, and it carries on, verse five,

229
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,180
 "Having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power."

230
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,220
 Having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power.

231
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,100
 He's looking at people in the church and he's going,

232
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,380
 "Some people here look holy.

233
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,020
 "Some people here look righteous.

234
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,180
 "Some people here look like leaders of the church,

235
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,020
 "but they are denying its power.

236
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,140
 "They are not really living by the power of God.

237
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,340
 "They are not really living by the power of the Holy Spirit,

238
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,860
 "even though they look like they're ticking all the boxes."

239
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,340
 Now this one hurts because I wonder how many of us here

240
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,660
 are committed to maintaining an appearance of godliness,

241
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,940
 myself included.

242
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,340
 But how many of us here are actually still denying its power?

243
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,180
 How many of us here are continually learning?

244
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,660
 I think it was verse seven,

245
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,740
 "Always learning, but never able to arrive at the truth."

246
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,740
 He's saying there's a group of people in the church

247
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,500
 right then and right now who are so committed to learning

248
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,420
 and filling their heads with knowledge

249
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,740
 that it never drops into their hearts

250
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,420
 and then never impacts the way they live.

251
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,540
 So they're denying the power of truth.

252
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,380
 They never arrive at that knowledge of truth.

253
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,460
 They're always just learning

254
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,020
 and filling, filling their heads up.

255
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,700
 And it's misleading.

256
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,580
 It's a misleading look.

257
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,460
 It's hypocrisy.

258
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,500
 When people are committed to only cleaning the cup

259
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,980
 on the outside, but the inside is completely dirty.

260
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,580
 That's what Jesus talked about, right?

261
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,620
 And this is what Paul's saying.

262
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,900
 He's saying there are this group of people

263
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,740
 that are doing that,

264
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,540
 that not only have they misdirected their love,

265
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,740
 they are also misleading other people.

266
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,340
 And he talks about a group of people

267
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,780
 and he's referring to a group of people

268
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,620
 who are going to influence, going into people's homes,

269
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,660
 especially women's homes and misleading them

270
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,820
 and teaching them and leading them astray.

271
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,420
 You've got to recognise at that point

272
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,660
 in culture and time, women weren't allowed to learn.

273
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,700
 So Christianity was a huge, radical, revolutionary thing

274
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,340
 where women were finally able to learn

275
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,140
 and they were keen and they were wanting to,

276
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,220
 but there were a group of people

277
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,500
 who were manipulating that and leading them astray.

278
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,620
 And Paul's saying, what does he say about those people?

279
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,260
 Avoid them.

280
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,180
 Avoid them.

281
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,260
 Have nothing to do with them.

282
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,740
 Kick them out of your church is actually what he's saying.

283
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,780
 Don't let them be members of your body

284
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,580
 because if that body gets corrupted,

285
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,540
 it won't be able to go anywhere.

286
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,980
 So that is the problem that you're going to face

287
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,020
 in the future, that you will have these people

288
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,660
 who are misleading and who are misdirected in their love.

289
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,820
 Just as Janus and Jambres opposed Moses,

290
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,340
 so these men also opposed the truth.

291
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,740
 And he refers to these two people

292
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,860
 who aren't actually referenced anywhere else in the Bible,

293
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,340
 but what he's referring to is the scene in Exodus 7

294
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,100
 where the miracles are happening,

295
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,420
 when Moses is trying to save the people,

296
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,660
 the Israelites, out of Egypt.

297
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,220
 And so all these miracles are happening.

298
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,100
 And then these two magicians

299
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,180
 who were trying to basically replicate what Moses is doing.

300
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,420
 And actually they succeed to a certain level.

301
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,140
 They managed to, through trickery, through magic,

302
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,060
 managed to get some tricks to happen.

303
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,420
 Counterfeiting miracles is what happens with these two guys.

304
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,220
 But Paul's saying, but eventually they will not get very far

305
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,100
 and their folly will be plain to his men.

306
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,180
 You see, here's the problem.

307
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,860
 Sometimes we follow things that look good.

308
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,140
 Sometimes we place our love into things

309
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,260
 that aren't really good.

310
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,100
 Why?

311
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
 Because they will hold these promises

312
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,940
 that they will satisfy us.

313
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,940
 They will hold these promises.

314
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,740
 Hey, if you follow me, if you look, look at this,

315
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,540
 look how beautiful it looks.

316
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,140
 Look how much you will be loved if you take this on.

317
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,340
 If you take this job or if you find this partner

318
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,060
 or if you pursue, if you buy this thing, if you buy that.

319
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,740
 But you see, that's the problem.

320
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,380
 And then we realise that actually that we've been misled.

321
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,460
 And so the question for us,

322
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,220
 as we think about this problem in the future,

323
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,660
 which is the problem for us right now,

324
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,580
 is are there loves that we have placed on things

325
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,700
 that actually shouldn't really be there?

326
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,060
 Have we misplaced our love?

327
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,220
 Have a think about that.

328
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,580
 Have we loved the wrong thing?

329
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,260
 And also have we put our trust and faith in people

330
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,340
 who actually may be misleading us?

331
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,940
 And this one requires such discernment for us

332
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,020
 as we think about, as we approach people,

333
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,460
 as we look at church leaders,

334
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,660
 as we look at pastors who are sharing the word of God,

335
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,780
 man, is this person sticking to the truth?

336
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,300
 Is this person sticking to the truth?

337
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,580
 There's this quote that the enemy didn't force Adam and Eve

338
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,620
 to lie and to disobey God.

339
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,660
 What did they do?

340
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,740
 The enemy basically just asked the Adam and Eve

341
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,740
 to mistrust what God said, distort the truth of God.

342
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,420
 And that's a question that we have to ask ourselves.

343
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,620
 Are we sticking to the truth?

344
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,420
 Because that is the way that we're gonna be able

345
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,860
 to answer the problems.

346
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,340
 So that's the first one really.

347
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,580
 The problem in the future is godlessness.

348
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,540
 The answer is from the past.

349
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,780
 And what is that answer?

350
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,060
 That answer is godliness.

351
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,060
 So he comes up with this whole list of bad things.

352
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,020
 And he's saying, "Hey, avoid such people."

353
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,020
 And then he looks at Timothy and then he goes,

354
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,420
 "You, however, you don't do that."

355
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,380
 He calls him out and sets him apart and says,

356
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,820
 "You, on the other hand, won't do that, can't do that.

357
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,660
 "Why?"

358
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,940
 And then he lists these things

359
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,660
 that Timothy himself has done.

360
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,180
 He says, "You, however, have followed my teaching,

361
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,460
 "my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience,

362
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,340
 "my love, my steadfastness, my persecutions and sufferings."

363
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,260
 So he goes through this list.

364
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,020
 He says, "You, Timothy, don't do these things.

365
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,060
 "Why?

366
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,900
 "Because you know better.

367
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
 "Why?

368
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,540
 "Because you followed my teaching.

369
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,620
 "You followed my conduct, my aim in life, my faith,

370
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,460
 "my patience, my love, my steadfastness."

371
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,580
 Isn't this interesting?

372
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,980
 He lists these six virtues out and says to Timothy,

373
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,860
 "You, however, don't do those things

374
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,220
 "because you've seen how I live."

375
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,060
 And he lists these things out.

376
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,580
 And the first one is teaching.

377
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,820
 And he says, "Hey, you know what I've taught.

378
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,140
 "You know the doctrine, but that's the only one

379
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,340
 "that really is about teaching.

380
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,180
 "What are all the other ones?

381
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,300
 "All the other ones are about life, are about conduct."

382
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,860
 You see, sometimes I think we just stop at teaching.

383
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,140
 We come into church and we think,

384
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,060
 "We are just gonna download information.

385
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,100
 "We listen to podcasts, and we're just gonna keep them

386
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,820
 "in our heads, and we're gonna leave them there

387
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,220
 "until our heads explode and they don't go anywhere."

388
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,180
 But Paul's saying that it's a part of it.

389
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,140
 It's an important part.

390
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:35,980
 It's the first part.

391
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,060
 It's the first thing on the list,

392
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,020
 but it's not the only thing.

393
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,660
 In fact, there are all these other things.

394
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:44,180
 "My teaching leads to my conduct, leads to my aim in life,

395
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,220
 "leads to my love, leads to my patience."

396
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,860
 He's saying, "You've watched me live."

397
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,020
 The passage that Mo shared on last week,

398
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,940
 2 Timothy 2, talks about this.

399
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,060
 2 chapter 2, verse 2, "And what you have heard from me

400
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,740
 "in the presence of many witnesses, entrust to faithful men

401
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,460
 "who will also be able to teach others."

402
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,460
 He's saying, "You've seen how I live.

403
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,500
 "You've been taught by me, and now I need you

404
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,540
 "to live it out and pass it on to other people."

405
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,540
 So with godlessness, that is the answer to,

406
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,620
 sorry, godliness is the answer to godlessness.

407
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,900
 But what does actually godliness look like?

408
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,220
 So if godlessness is misdirected love

409
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,580
 and it's misleading luck,

410
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,580
 godliness is intentionally lived and also intensely tested.

411
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,540
 And he starts with this, and as I just said,

412
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,500
 he goes through this whole list, and he's saying,

413
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,260
 "These are the things, you know what godliness is

414
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,860
 "because it's my teaching, it's my conduct,

415
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,500
 "it's my aim in life, it's my faith, my patience,

416
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,180
 "my love, my steadfastness."

417
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,020
 It is intentionally lived out.

418
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,260
 That is godliness.

419
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,660
 It's not just in the head.

420
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,540
 It is not just how many Bible verses you remember.

421
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,380
 It isn't how many Christian-y quotes you can memorise.

422
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:05,300
 Rather, it is intentionally lived out.

423
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,780
 It is modelled.

424
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,660
 And so the question for us is, do we model that godliness?

425
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,900
 We may have lots of Bible knowledge.

426
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,860
 We may be able to quote and retell

427
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,060
 Old Testament stories to kids, but do we live it out?

428
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,780
 Do we live it out?

429
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,900
 Is someone able to learn about God through the way we live?

430
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,500
 Do we intentionally live it out?

431
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,460
 Sometimes I look and I think about the people

432
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,260
 that I've followed, the mentors that I've had,

433
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,940
 and I'm like, "Man, I've taken some of their mannerisms.

434
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,620
 "I've learned how, actually, when I walk into a room

435
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,940
 "and I talk to people, I'm reminded

436
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,700
 "that's how my mentor used to talk to people."

437
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,860
 And I realise I've inherited some of his jokes

438
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,020
 and some of his bad sense of humour, and it's all there,

439
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,220
 but it's because I watched it.

440
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,260
 (speaking in foreign language)

441
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,780
 And it's a thing.

442
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,620
 But that's the thing.

443
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,140
 That's what Paul says that we should be doing.

444
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,060
 He's saying that, actually, not only should we look

445
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,140
 to have people to follow, we should also be

446
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,260
 the kind of person that other people follow.

447
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,540
 So there's actually two questions there.

448
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,380
 Maybe I'm cheating.

449
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,620
 The first question is this.

450
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,980
 Do you have anyone that you're following?

451
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,260
 You see, and actually, we hear this a lot.

452
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,660
 "Oh, I don't really have any mentors.

453
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,380
 "I don't have someone to kind of lead me in the right way."

454
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,940
 But you see, even when it comes to that,

455
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,700
 it needs a certain level of intentionality.

456
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,060
 So actually, for you, I encourage you, have a think.

457
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,860
 Are there people in your life,

458
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,740
 they don't have to necessarily be older than you,

459
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,500
 but just people that you look up to spiritually,

460
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,660
 or just in the way that they live,

461
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,860
 or maybe the way they parent,

462
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,500
 or the way that they go about their work?

463
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,940
 My encouragement to you is find those people,

464
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,220
 and then say, "Hey, I'd like to get to know you.

465
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,420
 "I'd like to get to understand why you are the way you are,

466
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,580
 "because I want to be a little bit like you."

467
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,020
 I had an experience of this this week.

468
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,940
 There's been someone who supports our mission

469
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,900
 to go and meet young people,

470
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,820
 and I was just having lunch with him,

471
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,780
 and I just couldn't help but ask him questions,

472
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,460
 because there's something about him.

473
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,020
 Now, he's very, very successful in his work,

474
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,780
 in his field of work, but yet,

475
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,500
 he takes his faith so, so seriously.

476
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,660
 I was like, "There's something about you

477
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,180
 "that I can't quite put a nail on it, finger on it,

478
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,860
 "but I want to know more about it.

479
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,740
 "I want to go to wherever you're going.

480
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,500
 "I want to talk to whoever you're talking to.

481
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,140
 "I want to be with you when you're discipling,

482
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,980
 "because there's something about you that I want to learn."

483
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,140
 So that's my first question.

484
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,980
 Are there any people like that in your life?

485
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,260
 There really should be.

486
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,740
 There really should be.

487
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,660
 Of course, we have to recognise that person

488
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,820
 is not a perfect person,

489
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,620
 but there's something that you can learn from that person.

490
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,940
 You see, the moment that we stop feeling

491
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,260
 as though we need to grow,

492
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,740
 the moment that we feel as though

493
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,100
 we are already at the top of our ladder,

494
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,580
 that's when we know that there's a problem,

495
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,020
 that we realise that we've always been learning,

496
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,500
 but we've not arrived yet at this knowledge of truth.

497
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,340
 So that's number one.

498
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,500
 And the second is then, as you look at your life,

499
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,180
 is your life worth following?

500
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,060
 You see, Paul, in these six virtues,

501
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,700
 basically summarises his life.

502
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,500
 Can you imagine just Paul's mindset?

503
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,580
 He's just about to die.

504
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,940
 He's just about to meet Jesus,

505
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,860
 and he summarises everything that he's done.

506
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,140
 His teaching, his aim in life,

507
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,700
 his love, his patience, his conduct,

508
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,140
 and he summarises it all.

509
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,100
 I wonder whether we are able to summarise what we did,

510
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,300
 what we've done, the lives that we've lived.

511
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,860
 Do we have people who look at us and go,

512
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,420
 "Oh, I want to follow you in that.

513
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,540
 "I love the way your kids have grown up.

514
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,220
 "I'd love to follow you.

515
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,100
 "I love the way that you approach and read the Word.

516
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,260
 "I love the way you pray."

517
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,780
 Now, not to say that we just do it

518
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,100
 for those moments of affirmation,

519
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,140
 because then we would just be appearing godly,

520
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,780
 but are we genuinely both godly

521
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,220
 and also not denying the Holy Spirit working in us?

522
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,580
 Do we have those people?

523
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,860
 Because godliness is intentionally lived,

524
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,260
 but it's also intensely tested.

525
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,180
 And this next passage here is the one

526
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,700
 that really should send shivers down our spines.

527
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,100
 "Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life

528
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,220
 "in Christ Jesus will be persecuted."

529
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,020
 As I said, we in Hong Kong, right here, right now,

530
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,860
 are not going through the same persecution

531
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,180
 as Paul and Timothy are.

532
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,020
 That's, they win, okay, in that sense.

533
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,300
 But there comes another question.

534
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,740
 What does this verse mean?

535
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,780
 "Indeed, those who desire to live a godly life

536
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,180
 "will face persecution."

537
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,660
 It leads me to another question in my mind is,

538
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,980
 does my faith cost me anything?

539
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:41,740
 For you, does you following in Jesus cost you anything?

540
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:47,740
 Just have to think about that for a second.

541
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,020
 Does it cost you to not have your own way in any scenario?

542
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,580
 Does it cost you when it comes to a certain promotion

543
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,180
 because you have to act a certain way?

544
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,380
 Does it cost you in something?

545
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,460
 Because here's the thing,

546
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,940
 I think if your faith in God doesn't cost you anything,

547
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,260
 I don't know whether it's worth anything.

548
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,540
 Can I say that again?

549
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,940
 If our faith in Jesus doesn't cost us something,

550
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,140
 I don't know if it's worth anything.

551
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,180
 I don't know if it's worth that much

552
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,380
 because godliness is intensely tested.

553
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,740
 There must be something about us following,

554
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,860
 declaring to follow this Jesus, this saviour,

555
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,820
 who ended up dying on a cross, by the way.

556
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,740
 So we shouldn't just expect prosperity

557
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,940
 and blessings from him because clearly,

558
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,620
 the man that we profess to follow

559
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,220
 did not end up with a big mansion,

560
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,540
 at least not here on earth.

561
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,220
 But if godliness is to be strived for,

562
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,980
 then it must cost something.

563
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,940
 And so the question for us is,

564
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,380
 do we ever put ourselves in a position

565
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,100
 where we surrender that control?

566
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,100
 We're back to control again.

567
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,740
 Where we get to that point where we're like,

568
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,820
 okay God, you're real, you're good,

569
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,060
 and because of that, I'm gonna let go.

570
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,700
 I know it's gonna cost me something,

571
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,500
 but I count everything else as loss

572
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,580
 in comparison to knowing you.

573
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,380
 Do we have that kind of heart

574
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,860
 when it comes to pursuing godliness?

575
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,740
 Because it must cost us something.

576
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:23,820
 Because a lot of the times, what we try and do,

577
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,660
 we try and be the best Christians we can be

578
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,580
 whilst being the best bankers

579
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,500
 or the best lawyers or the best teachers.

580
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,140
 We try and just blend into society.

581
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,260
 Sometimes I try and convince people,

582
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,460
 I say, "Hey, I'm a Christian,

583
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,500
 "but before you leave, I'm not weird."

584
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,220
 Especially, you know what?

585
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,380
 Many, many pastors say this.

586
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,100
 Whenever we go and meet new people,

587
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,500
 it's almost the question that stops,

588
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,180
 the word that stops any kind of conversation.

589
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,820
 They ask, "Oh, I'm James."

590
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,660
 "Oh, what do you do?"

591
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,780
 "Well, I'm a pastor."

592
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,100
 And suddenly, everyone else is like,

593
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,540
 "Oh, you're a pastor."

594
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,380
 Like, okay, I'm not gonna talk to you.

595
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,980
 Put your Bible away.

596
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,620
 And then I'm like, "No, no, no, I'm really cool.

597
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,700
 "Seriously, talk to me.

598
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,540
 "I'm really funny.

599
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
 "Keep talking to me.

600
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,500
 "I'm actually quite a normal person."

601
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,580
 And in our desire to fit in,

602
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,540
 to be loved and to be accepted,

603
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,860
 we end up compromising on what the gospel truly is about.

604
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,340
 That we have also been looked at by Jesus saying,

605
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,140
 "You, however, are different.

606
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,580
 "You may be in this world, but you are not of this world.

607
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,500
 "If you want to follow me, you have to die to yourself

608
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
 "and carry your cross and follow me.

609
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,140
 "It has to cost you something

610
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,020
 "because it cost me everything."

611
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,500
 This was the argument that I was having with Jesus

612
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,940
 when I was wrestling with him about coming to Hong Kong.

613
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,620
 I'm like, "And I've shared this before.

614
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,420
 "Do you understand all the things

615
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,260
 "I'm gonna have to let go of

616
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,900
 "in order to follow you to this crazy city

617
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,020
 "across the other side of the world?

618
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,380
 "Do you understand everything that,

619
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,020
 "I'm gonna have to do all these things?"

620
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,700
 And then the Lord spoke so clearly to me.

621
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,900
 He says, "Yes, I understand.

622
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,140
 "I know, my child.

623
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,460
 "But do you recognise what I gave for you?"

624
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,740
 And you see, sometimes we are trapped in that.

625
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,940
 It's like, "Oh, I wanna follow you, God.

626
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,180
 "I wanna be godly,

627
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,060
 "but what's the cheapest deal

628
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,820
 "that I can obtain to be godly?

629
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,540
 "Is there some kind of discount that I can get?

630
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,740
 "Is there some kind of voucher code I can get

631
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,860
 "where I can still be wholesome and godly,

632
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,500
 "but it doesn't cost me anything?

633
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,100
 "Can I find that deal?"

634
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,540
 But here, Paul says in verse 12,

635
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:35,460
 "Indeed, those who desire to live a godly life

636
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,380
 "will be persecuted."

637
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,660
 Maybe not in the same way that they were being persecuted,

638
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,060
 but it's got a cost to something.

639
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,980
 Do you get that?

640
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,180
 It's got a cost to something.

641
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,220
 Our faith has to be tested.

642
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,140
 It has to be tested.

643
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,540
 Godliness has to be intensely tested.

644
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,980
 So the problem in the future,

645
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,820
 the answer is in the past,

646
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,980
 in terms of the time that he spent with Paul.

647
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,900
 That's his answer.

648
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,220
 The godliness is, "Hey, you saw me live out

649
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,180
 "this godly life.

650
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,780
 "Remember it, especially when you're facing

651
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,620
 "these difficult times and I'm not around anymore.

652
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,940
 "Would you just remember?"

653
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,460
 He reminds him, "Hey, Timothy, do you remember that time

654
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,980
 "we were in Iconium?

655
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,380
 "Do you remember that time I was in Lystra?

656
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,820
 "Do you remember that time where you were with me

657
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,540
 "in these places in Antioch?

658
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,580
 "Do you remember?

659
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,260
 "When you go through your own stuff,"

660
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,540
 and every parent will have this,

661
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,500
 "Child, when you go through your own troubles,

662
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,340
 "remember the time that you spent with me in those places.

663
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,300
 "Remember what I was like.

664
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,500
 "The answer, your answer to the future

665
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
 "will be in your past with me.

666
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,220
 "And remember that.

667
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,380
 "Remember how I taught you.

668
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,700
 "Remember how I lived out my life.

669
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,940
 "Remember what the purpose of my life was.

670
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,660
 "Remember the love and the patience I had

671
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,300
 "even when I was beat down and persecuted in prison.

672
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
 "Remember, remember."

673
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,900
 And so we've talked about the future,

674
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,140
 we've talked about looking back,

675
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,020
 and finally, the charge for the present.

676
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,700
 And the charge here is this, to continue.

677
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,660
 Who's good at starting things,

678
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,220
 but not very good at finishing things or sustaining things?

679
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,820
 Paul's charge here at the very end is continue.

680
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,860
 Continue in what?

681
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,340
 Continue in the truth.

682
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,900
 In the midst of all this persecution,

683
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,700
 the way you avoid godlessness

684
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,020
 and the way you achieve godliness

685
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,820
 is by sticking to the truth.

686
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,700
 Remember, the enemy didn't force Adam and Eve to lie,

687
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,460
 but he tempted them to question the word of God.

688
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,180
 Did he really say that to you?

689
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,700
 Are you really that loved?

690
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,700
 Can you really trust in God?

691
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,140
 Or actually, should you try and fight

692
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,260
 for this promotion yourself?

693
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,180
 Should you engage in these office politics

694
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,300
 to try and manoeuvre your way to get a better life?

695
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:05,340
 The enemy tempts us to basically question the word of God.

696
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,540
 His tactics have not changed after all these years.

697
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,540
 So Paul's charge to Timothy is what?

698
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:13,860
 To continue in the truth.

699
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,300
 And he's saying, you're gonna face so many things

700
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,380
 that you don't know,

701
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,140
 but let what you know inform what you don't know.

702
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,660
 You're gonna face so many scenarios

703
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,580
 where there are completely unprecedented

704
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,820
 and filled with trouble.

705
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,460
 How are you gonna face those things?

706
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:33,220
 Let what you know from the word of God

707
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,260
 inform what you don't know.

708
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,020
 What you have here is not specific instructions

709
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,940
 in how you cope with an economic crisis.

710
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,340
 There are no specific instructions here

711
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,620
 about how you cope with a social unrest

712
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,060
 that's happening just in front of you on your street.

713
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,980
 It just has no specific instructions

714
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,820
 about these things right now in 2021 in Hong Kong.

715
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:59,820
 But what it does have is the values and the principles

716
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,380
 that have transcended time.

717
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,980
 Do you recognise this book that you read,

718
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,180
 that we're reading here,

719
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,140
 transcends time to the point where

720
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,460
 people have been holding this book

721
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,700
 for thousands of thousands of years.

722
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,300
 And it still remains relevant.

723
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,700
 And Paul, what he says to Timothy here in chapter three,

724
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,100
 verses 14 to 16 is,

725
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,700
 "Remember what you have read and continue in this truth."

726
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,100
 And really he's asking him to remember two things,

727
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,380
 where you came from and where you're heading.

728
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,060
 And these final few verses show us this.

729
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,780
 And he's saying, if you're gonna keep

730
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,540
 to this very, very narrow path of godliness,

731
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,220
 you need to remember the truth.

732
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,220
 And when he says that, he says,

733
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,220
 "Remember where you came from," verse 14 and 15, he says,

734
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,220
 "But as for you, continue in what you have learned

735
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,740
 "and firmly believe, knowing from who you have learned it."

736
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,060
 Whom did he learn it from?

737
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,340
 He learned it from Paul himself,

738
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,380
 because when he was a teenager,

739
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,660
 Paul met him in Leicester and said,

740
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,140
 "Hey, young man, you come with me

741
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,820
 "and I'm gonna teach you everything that I know," number one.

742
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,380
 He also learned it from his grandmother, Lois,

743
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,300
 and from his mother, Eunice.

744
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,020
 And he's saying, when you face these problems in the future

745
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,380
 where the times will be difficult,

746
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:12,860
 I want you to remember me, your grandmother, and your mother.

747
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,820
 I want you to remember us,

748
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,700
 because you need to remember who you are.

749
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,580
 You need to remember where you came from.

750
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,620
 This was the identity crisis that Simba had

751
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,900
 in "The Lion King," when Rafiki hits him on the head.

752
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,540
 Do you remember?

753
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,820
 And then he hears his voice from heaven

754
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,980
 and that's where it gets really epic.

755
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,300
 He says, "Remember who you are.

756
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,300
 "Look back at your past.

757
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,980
 "Look back and remember all the things you learned."

758
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,980
 And I think probably someone needs to hear this today.

759
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:48,220
 Someone who has now reached,

760
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,740
 you may have reached this crossword

761
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,460
 where you are now in unprecedented territory.

762
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,260
 You are in completely new territory.

763
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,860
 Your parents are behind you.

764
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,340
 Your future is ahead of you.

765
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,620
 But suddenly you're like, "Oh my goodness,

766
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,900
 "I have to make decisions on my own.

767
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,620
 "I have to face these troubles on my own.

768
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,020
 "This isn't like when I was a child,

769
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:08,020
 "when I was told exactly what to do and I would just do it."

770
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,060
 And Paul's saying, "Let that be the voice in your head.

771
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,140
 "Let my voice be the voice in your head.

772
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,220
 "Remember what I taught you.

773
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,540
 "Remember what your grandmother taught you.

774
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,380
 "Remember what your mother taught you.

775
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,300
 "And remember the sacred writings."

776
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,340
 Do we treat this book as sacred writings?

777
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,980
 Most of the time I just treat it as an app

778
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,180
 with a notification that is really annoying me

779
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,580
 'cause I know myself.

780
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:31,420
 So what do I do?

781
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,700
 I set myself reminders and notifications on my phone

782
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:36,180
 to read your Bible five times a day.

783
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,340
 And each time I see it pop up, I'm like,

784
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,900
 "Oh, it's you again.

785
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,540
 "Just get rid of it."

786
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,820
 But these are sacred writings.

787
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,020
 These have been passed on for thousands of years.

788
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,420
 These still remain to be true right now.

789
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,820
 And actually, one thing here to note,

790
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,820
 when Paul says to Timothy,

791
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,660
 "Remember what you learned from him.

792
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,460
 "Remember the sacred writings."

793
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,460
 He's not talking about

794
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,340
 the lovey-dovey Romantic New Testament.

795
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,980
 He's talking about Deuteronomy, Leviticus, numbers.

796
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,380
 Ezekiel, Isaiah.

797
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,220
 He's talking about the Old Testament.

798
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,580
 And what is it about the Old Testament?

799
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,940
 What's the story of the Old Testament?

800
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,940
 If there's anything that Timothy needs to remember

801
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,180
 and learn from the Old Testament, what is it?

802
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,980
 It's about the depravity of man.

803
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,420
 It's about the brokenness within us.

804
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,260
 And it's about our dependence for God.

805
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:30,260
 It's about the mistakes of man, but the grace of God.

806
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,980
 And he's saying, "Timothy, hold onto these truths.

807
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,220
 "Hold onto these things,

808
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,140
 "because these are the ones that are gonna keep you

809
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,100
 "on the straight and narrow.

810
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,660
 "Continue in the truth.

811
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,660
 "The truth is the only thing that will set you free

812
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,260
 "from the times of difficulty that will come about."

813
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,020
 How much do we cling onto this truth here?

814
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,660
 How much do we recognise that this truly is the Word of God?

815
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,340
 And he finishes, and he talks about what Scripture is.

816
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,700
 That Scripture is God-breathed.

817
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,540
 That these are the very words of God.

818
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,260
 And yet so often we just dismiss them,

819
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,420
 or we just remember soundbites just to keep us going.

820
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,140
 Just for whatever circumstance we have.

821
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,180
 We open the Bible up and go,

822
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,820
 "God, speak to me about my workplace.

823
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,980
 "Speak to me about my relationship.

824
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,900
 "Speak to me.

825
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,460
 "Describe me again.

826
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,300
 "Tell me about me."

827
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:24,700
 But no, do we recognise that we are part of this rich history

828
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,700
 and heritage of saints and sinners that have come before us?

829
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,620
 And do we treat this Word as sacred?

830
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,700
 Do we treat this Word as absolute truth?

831
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,500
 Because that's what we declare that we believe,

832
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,100
 but do we live it out?

833
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,100
 That's a question that we need to ask ourselves.

834
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,260
 And finally, because it teaches us where we're going.

835
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,660
 Because all Scripture is God-breathed.

836
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,020
 And in Hebrews 4 it says,

837
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,460
 "Scripture is living and active,

838
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,500
 "like a double-edged sword."

839
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,180
 And do we treat this Word of God like that?

840
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,620
 Because Paul's saying,

841
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,340
 "I charge you to continue in the truth."

842
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,580
 And there's two things that this truth will remind you.

843
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,780
 One, it will make you wise for salvation.

844
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,980
 Verse 15, "It will make you wise for salvation."

845
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,060
 What does that mean?

846
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,540
 It means that you will finally arrive

847
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,220
 at the knowledge of truth.

848
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,220
 You will be instructed about how you get

849
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,580
 to be in eternity with the Lord.

850
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,820
 It will tell you where you're heading.

851
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,980
 And the second thing is that you will then be finally,

852
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,100
 oh, oh, it's not there.

853
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,180
 It will finally, very, very, very final bit,

854
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,940
 that the man of God may be complete,

855
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,260
 equipped for every good work.

856
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,180
 So one, the goal of remembering and clinging to the truth

857
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,260
 is that then you will be wise for salvation.

858
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,020
 You will know that you are saved by Jesus,

859
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,300
 and that is where you are heading.

860
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,300
 And also that you will be equipped for every good work.

861
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,980
 You see, sometimes when we finally get it,

862
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,260
 when we finally get, ah, we are living for eternity,

863
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,620
 the things in this world won't matter.

864
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,260
 I constantly have this friend in my head

865
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,700
 who's, again, very, very successful in his field.

866
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,780
 And I was talking to him saying,

867
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:06,460
 "Hey, would you like to start a Bible study with this guy?

868
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,380
 "I know you're very busy.

869
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,660
 "I know you've got tons of things on in your job,

870
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,900
 "and lots of responsibilities,

871
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,180
 "but would you like to have a breakfast Bible study

872
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,300
 "with me and this other guy?

873
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,420
 "'Cause I think it would be really good

874
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,140
 "just for us to just be and spend time

875
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,260
 "in the Word together."

876
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,700
 And he said this thing, and he's like,

877
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,300
 "James, my job won't really matter in eternity.

878
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,300
 "So absolutely, yes, because this is what matters."

879
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,580
 And so when we finally get to that point

880
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,620
 where we realise, man,

881
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,620
 eternity is so much bigger than I realised,

882
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,580
 that this world that I'm living right now,

883
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,580
 these few decades that I have here are so, so, so, so small,

884
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,540
 there is a temptation, there is a risk that isn't so good,

885
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:49,020
 is that we just keep our eyes completely focused on heaven,

886
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,580
 that we are now wise for salvation.

887
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,780
 We are up there in the clouds,

888
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,180
 and that's when people start thinking that we're weird

889
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,180
 because we don't want to have anything to do

890
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,020
 with this earth.

891
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,940
 But that's the problem, right?

892
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,140
 That's the quote, right?

893
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,660
 Not only can we be heavenly-minded,

894
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,260
 but let's still be earthly good.

895
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:09,020
 Let's still be equipped for every good work.

896
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,660
 So that's the purpose of truth.

897
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,020
 To one, show us where we're going.

898
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,620
 Let make us wise for salvation,

899
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,060
 but also still equip us.

900
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,340
 This book can equip us

901
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,140
 so that we can still be of earthly good.

902
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:28,020
 The problem in the future,

903
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,380
 the problem right now is godlessness.

904
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,940
 It's this desire to be God himself, to control.

905
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,540
 The answer is in the past.

906
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,860
 And the charge right now, in the present,

907
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,420
 is to continue in the truth.

908
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,180
 How do we avoid godlessness?

909
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,420
 And how do we maintain hope in this godless world

910
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,700
 as we are surrounded just by terrible news?

911
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,060
 And how do we pursue godliness?

912
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,260
 And that's where my conclusion comes.

913
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,300
 If you're to remember one thing from this message,

914
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,380
 is how we are to respond and cope

915
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,260
 with the godlessness that surrounds us,

916
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,020
 we recognize that there is godlessness within us.

917
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,660
 I don't know how well you feel

918
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,820
 as being a human being right now.

919
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,540
 I wonder whether you feel that you are

920
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,260
 a decent and a good Christian.

921
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,580
 The heart of the gospel is to tell us that,

922
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,220
 no, actually, no one is good,

923
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,460
 at least to the level that the Lord requires.

924
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,820
 And recognizing that there is godlessness

925
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,820
 within each and every one of us.

926
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,380
 That is the step number one.

927
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,300
 And step number two is recognizing

928
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,740
 that God has also rescued you.

929
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:49,580
 You see, tucked in in this passage, right in the middle,

930
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,900
 when Paul is talking about his experiences of godliness

931
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,540
 and reminding Timothy what happened

932
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,820
 in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra,

933
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,980
 he says these words at the end of verse 11.

934
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,460
 Which persecutions I endured,

935
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,580
 yet from them all the Lord rescued me.

936
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,980
 From all these things, the Lord rescued me.

937
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,580
 So one, let's recognize, let's remember

938
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,380
 that we all inside us have a level of godlessness

939
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,380
 that we need to repent of, that we need to be aware of.

940
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,700
 Each and every one of us.

941
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,420
 But then before we get too down on ourselves,

942
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,220
 we also remind ourselves, just like Paul,

943
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,180
 just like Timothy, we have all been rescued.

944
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,460
 By who?

945
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,980
 By the only one who is good.

946
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,220
 By the only one who is perfect, Jesus.

947
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,260
 And why?

948
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,340
 Not just to save us, but then to equip us

949
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:47,460
 for every good work right now.

950
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,500
 So that's the question, and that's the final question for us.

951
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,140
 What have you been rescued for?

952
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:57,460
 What have you been rescued for?

953
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,780
 May it be for the good works

954
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,260
 that the Lord has planned for you.

955
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,340
 I'll finish with this verse that Paul talks about

956
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,740
 in Ephesians chapter two.

957
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,580
 For we are saved by grace through faith.

958
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,780
 Not your own doing, but a gift of God.

959
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,820
 Not resolve works, for we are his workmanship

960
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,060
 created in Christ Jesus for good works.

961
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,820
 May we recognize and accept

962
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,780
 that we are surrounded by godlessness,

963
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,540
 that we also have godlessness,

964
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,660
 but may we pursue godliness by sticking to the truth,

965
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,420
 and the ultimate truth, the one truth

966
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,500
 that he wants you to remember,

967
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,940
 that this pastor wants you to remember,

968
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,340
 that the Lord wants you to remember,

969
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,980
 that you have been rescued.

970
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,820
 Shall we pray?

971
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:52,900
 Jesus, we thank you that you truly are the beautiful saviour.

972
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:56,900
 Will we spend a moment now and

973
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:03,060
 repent of the godlessness that exists in our hearts?

974
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,820
 Those 18 characteristics of godlessness

975
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,780
 that you warned Timothy about.

976
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,900
 I know every single one of us here

977
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,260
 are at least guilty of one.

978
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,260
 Some may even be guilty of all 18.

979
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:27,820
 But we take heart and recognize

980
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,780
 that despite all those things,

981
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,540
 regardless of all those things,

982
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,300
 we are deeply loved,

983
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:37,420
 that we have been saved and rescued by you.

984
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:45,660
 So we respond to your charge for us to continue in truth,

985
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,460
 that we cling on to your word, your sacred word,

986
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,620
 the word that you breathed out,

987
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,380
 the word that is living and active,

988
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,460
 profitable for everything,

989
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,580
 for teaching, for rebuking, for correcting, for training,

990
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,900
 in order that we would be equipped for every good work.

991
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,500
 (gentle music)

992
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:13,340
 Lord, bring us people who we can imitate.

993
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:20,500
 May we be people that are worth imitating.

994
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:29,500
 And Lord, may we be heavenly minded,

995
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,300
 but also still capable of earthly good.

996
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,900
 (gentle music)

997
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,020
 Thank you for this time.

998
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,500
 And as we respond in worship to finish,

999
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,860
 we cast our eyes back to you,

1000
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,500
 the one whom we desire to imitate,

1001
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,100
 the one who saved us, the only one who is good.

1002
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,020
 Jesus, you are the answer.

1003
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,660
 Jesus, you are the same yesterday, today, and forever.

1004
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,580
 So ultimately, we cling to you because you are the way,

1005
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,700
 you are the truth, and you are the life.

1006
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,980
 Thank you, Lord.
