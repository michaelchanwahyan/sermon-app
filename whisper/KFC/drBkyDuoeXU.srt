00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 (electronic clicking)

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,160
 Hello, and welcome back to SPAN TV,

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,080
 and it's time for another NAS face-off.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,440
 Slight difference this time.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,240
 I know you guys are probably sick of the Synology

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,720
 versus QNAP, QNAP versus Synology videos I do,

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,400
 so we're trying to phase in more and more brands

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,480
 and get the brands interested,

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,080
 and more importantly, to give you a better understanding

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,400
 of which NASes you should get

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,360
 for your individual media setup.

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,480
 So, as you can tell from the title,

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,800
 this comparison is going to be

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,200
 between the WD MyCloud EX2 Ultra,

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,520
 WD's latest NAS there, the 2-Bay,

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,040
 and we're gonna face it off against

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,760
 Synology's own latest 2-Bay cost-effective NAS,

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,960
 Synology's DS216J, a very popular NAS indeed,

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,760
 and it's a NAS a lot of people,

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,520
 a lot of you guys out there are asking us

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,720
 to compare other units against.

22
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,400
 Now, there's no denying they're part

23
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,960
 of the cost-effective bracket of NAS.

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,840
 That is to say that you're not paying a huge amount,

25
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,920
 but what you get, you do get quite a lot of features.

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,560
 So, you can forget about things like Plex Media transcoding

27
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,800
 and high-end 4K surveillance,

28
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,000
 and the big, big, and virtualization

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
 would be an absolute joke on these two NASes,

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,800
 to be perfectly honest with you,

31
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,880
 but at the same time,

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,520
 there are lots of things these NASes can do,

33
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,800
 and if you are sticking towards the more traditional,

34
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,140
 old-school ways of using NAS file backup,

35
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,240
 media streaming, DLNA, the occasional image backup,

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,020
 then these NASes might be right for you,

37
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,040
 but of course, you don't know which one's,

38
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,160
 you know, it's better of the two,

39
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,720
 which one better suits your needs.

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
 So, what we're gonna do is we're gonna break down

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,360
 the pluses, the minuses,

42
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,800
 and give you a better understanding

43
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,440
 which one deserves your data.

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,160
 So, straight away, probably one of the more important factors

45
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,040
 for a great many of you is, of course, cost.

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,520
 I can tell you right now that the WD MyCloud EX2

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,360
 arrives at span.com, available now for, nice plug,

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,440
 £123 without the VAT and without drives.

49
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,280
 However, this unit can be purchased with drives,

50
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,520
 and those are WD drives installed at WD MyCloud system.

51
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,000
 And suitably, those drives are reduced in price as well.

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,820
 So, if you do buy this unit pre-populated with drives,

53
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,360
 you will find those prices are lower

54
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,320
 once you've installed the hardware, the hard drives.

55
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,680
 Whereas the Synology DS216J arrives at £119,

56
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,080
 so it's the cheaper of the two.

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,280
 However, it should be stated that you can't purchase

58
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,880
 this unit pre-populated in the conventional sense.

59
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,440
 You can buy this unit from vendors,

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,040
 including span.com, again, subtle plug,

61
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,120
 with drives inside.

62
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,200
 Now, install the drives for you at no additional cost,

63
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,680
 but of course, the drives will still work out

64
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,000
 more expensive on the whole once installed in the Synology

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 as they would be if they're pre-installed,

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,640
 pre-populated in the WD, so do bear that in mind.

67
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,800
 So, yes, the Synology is the cheaper of the two,

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
 but once you start looking at these devices

69
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
 with the hard drives installed,

70
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,920
 the WD will work out a pinch cheaper,

71
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,080
 particularly given that you will be installing

72
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,000
 most likely in this day and age,

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,360
 and the popularity of them, WD Red NAS hard drives.

74
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
 Anyway, the drives that are installed in this device.

75
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,000
 So, for the price round, I'm gonna give this to the Synology

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,640
 with that extra caveat.

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,360
 Now, they're both 2-Bay NASes.

78
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,800
 Neither of them can be expanded in the conventional sense

79
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,760
 with an expansion, but you can attach USB drives.

80
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,720
 We'll get to that later on about ports.

81
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,480
 With regards to the hardware,

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,120
 the MyCloud EX2 arrives with a Marvell Armada 385 chip,

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,880
 and that's a dual-core 1.3 gigahertz CPU,

84
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,240
 and the unit also arrives with one gigabyte of DDR3 RAM.

85
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,160
 The Synology DS216J, as mentioned in other videos,

86
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,440
 arrives with the Marvell Armada 385,

87
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,200
 exactly the same kind of chip,

88
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,720
 but a lower frequency, being a dual-core 1.0 gigahertz chip.

89
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,440
 So, a lower CPU of the two,

90
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,160
 and also arrives with half a gig of DDR3 RAM,

91
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
 as you can see on the screen.

92
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,880
 So, straight away, the WD MyCloud does have a higher spec

93
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,320
 with regard to those two,

94
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,920
 probably the most conventionally understood areas of hardware.

95
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
 It's got this lot of little thing

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,480
 about build quality and OS,

97
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,960
 but when it comes to those two staples of CPU and RAM,

98
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,080
 then these two factors in the WD give it superiority,

99
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,760
 and I've got to give this round to the WD.

100
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,080
 So, if we look at the rear of these two devices

101
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,080
 on the screen right now,

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,680
 'cause the front's only got some LED lights for you there,

103
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,960
 and a button, you can see that both of these units

104
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,840
 arrive with two USB 3.0 ports and a gigabit LAN port,

105
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,680
 and they've both got ventilation on the rear.

106
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,520
 But I've got to say,

107
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,040
 there's a little bit more ventilation throughout

108
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,880
 on the WD MyCloud.

109
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,040
 Additionally, the drives,

110
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,000
 once you try to install them in the two ones that you j,

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
 you have to dismantle the unit ever so slightly

112
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,560
 to slide those drives in,

113
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,120
 whereas with the WD MyCloud EX2,

114
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,640
 there is a little bit more of a hot-swapping ability there

115
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,200
 with the drives sliding through the two,

116
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,000
 but I don't advise hot-swapping on this device as such.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,720
 But just for those ports and the physicality

118
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,120
 and the ventilation through the device,

119
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,640
 and the fact that the WD MyCloud,

120
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,200
 I know you can't really tell on the screen there,

121
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,920
 is quintessentially smaller.

122
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,480
 If you look at the unboxing video for both,

123
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,560
 you can see that they are smaller, the WD.

124
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,400
 I've got to give this round also to the WD,

125
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,140
 which is surprising even to me.

126
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,480
 Now, both of them have got their own software on board,

127
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,920
 the NAS software on the Synology, the DSM 5.2,

128
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,680
 whereas WD have got their own native OS on there,

129
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,480
 but it's not updated anywhere near as much,

130
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,240
 and straight away, in terms of software,

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,880
 louder rumble you're gonna hear in the video.

132
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,840
 The software options, the bigger and better software options

133
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,880
 are, is superior on the Synology,

134
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,520
 but we'll get to that more later on.

135
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,440
 And they both use an EXT4 file system internally.

136
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,320
 Now, with regards to use, the WD is nowhere near as diverse

137
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,120
 as the Synology in terms of apps and ability.

138
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,960
 It handles, it should be said, though,

139
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,000
 it does handle traditional NAS needs,

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,400
 as mentioned earlier in the video, very, very well,

141
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,520
 and in many respects, superior to the Synology.

142
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,880
 The DLNA media sharing, it communicated with my PS4

143
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,800
 a lot better than the Synology.

144
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
 It sort of popped up immediately and integrated

145
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,640
 and accessed those directly, and the files were distributed

146
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,880
 a lot quicker and automatically better than in the Synology,

147
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,820
 where I had to create directories first.

148
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,840
 As a media server, they're pretty much even,

149
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,720
 and as a mail server, even still,

150
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,920
 but as a download server, the Synology was a little better.

151
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,680
 I think it just gave more license to do more things

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,020
 as a download station.

153
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,600
 But the WD did hold its own very, very well.

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,280
 As an image backup for you Apple Time Machine users

155
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,300
 out there, both of these units are completely compatible

156
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,660
 with Apple Time Machine.

157
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,080
 However, the WD lets you create those images

158
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,440
 with the Apple software, whereas with the Synology,

159
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,000
 they're phasing out the Apple Time Machine app

160
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,620
 in their app store, and slowly but surely,

161
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,960
 as many of you may have known about the DS216J

162
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,600
 in previous reviews, that the image software

163
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,220
 that the Synology comes with is becoming

164
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,580
 just more compatible with Apple Time Machine.

165
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,960
 The Apple Time Machine app is slowly disappearing

166
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,460
 from the app store, but apart from that,

167
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,420
 the units are very, very similar indeed.

168
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,380
 Last quick mention, the WD My Cloud arrives

169
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,620
 with a Plex Media app available to be installed.

170
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,700
 Now, they both have that, but you have to kind of install

171
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,340
 it externally with the DS216J via the DSM PC

172
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,660
 and get the installation file and install it.

173
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,700
 Now, neither of these units can transcode,

174
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,820
 as I've mentioned earlier in the video,

175
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,240
 but just because that Plex Media app

176
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,740
 and the way it was running things,

177
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,700
 and of course that hardware behind it,

178
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,920
 software-wise, if you're going for just traditional means

179
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,740
 for your NAS use, go for the WD.

180
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,900
 Those small jobs, you know, you want them done well.

181
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,040
 You don't need them quickly.

182
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,980
 If you were looking at quickly,

183
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,720
 you wouldn't have been looking at budget NASes like these,

184
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,620
 these cost-effective NASes, but between the two of them,

185
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,220
 for those core NAS needs, I've got to give this

186
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,540
 to the WD, with the caveat that the Synology

187
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,500
 has a huge app store by comparison.

188
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,740
 You can do far more diverse things with it.

189
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,660
 There's Torrent, other FTP, other mouse server options.

190
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,700
 There's music sharing apps that you wouldn't get on the WD,

191
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,340
 and of course, educational apps as well,

192
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,800
 but they can be a little temperamental

193
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,660
 and they are mixed among beaters.

194
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,140
 With that phasing out of Apple Time Machine,

195
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,820
 it has put a lot of people off, but it has to be said,

196
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,440
 it does hold its own, and if you're looking

197
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:13,300
 for things outside of the traditional means

198
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,700
 of using a NAS, slightly more experimental by comparison,

199
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,260
 then definitely go for the Synology.

200
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,420
 So in many respects, for me, the WD did win

201
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,380
 in terms of use in the traditional sense,

202
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,840
 but overall, it's got to be a draw.

203
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,140
 Now, wrapping this comparison up,

204
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,540
 we can say they've both got two years

205
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,420
 of manufacturer's warranty, so if there's any hardware

206
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,900
 problems whatsoever, both respective manufacturers

207
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,880
 will cover you for that two-year period.

208
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,260
 Now, for power consumption, the WD utilised 14.1 watts

209
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,100
 whilst in access, and 4.22 watts whilst

210
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,020
 in hard drive hibernation, that is low power

211
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,020
 not being used idle, whereas the Synology utilised

212
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,180
 14.85 watts whilst in access, and 6.95 watts

213
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,020
 whilst in that hibernation standby,

214
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,480
 whatever you want to call it.

215
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,340
 So, less power was utilised by the WD,

216
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,860
 which I found a little bit surprising to be honest,

217
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,420
 'cause I thought Synology had really trimmed things down

218
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,820
 with the 216J.

219
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,620
 Nevertheless, I've got to give that round to the WD as well,

220
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,140
 and again, I'm as surprised as you are by this comparison.

221
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,180
 Finally, let's talk about read and write speed,

222
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,020
 with such similar chips, and not much of a difference

223
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,820
 between them, apart from the frequency and the double RAM,

224
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,660
 you'd think the results would be very similar indeed,

225
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,840
 and do you know what, they're not that far off.

226
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,380
 The read on a WD MyClad EX2 was 116 megabytes per second,

227
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,860
 and the write was 118 megabytes per second,

228
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,400
 where on the Synology, the DS216J,

229
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,700
 it was 112 megabytes per second read,

230
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,220
 and 97.6 megabytes per second write,

231
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,420
 and a lot of that is to do with that CPU

232
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,020
 and that RAM being lesser than its contemporary.

233
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,980
 So, straight away we can see the read and write,

234
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,220
 or upload and download, however you want to call it,

235
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,620
 was superior on the WD.

236
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,740
 So, here we are at the end of the comparison,

237
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,500
 it might not come as a huge surprise to tell you

238
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,220
 that I'm gonna put my weight, surprisingly,

239
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,060
 behind the WD MyClad.

240
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,160
 I've always put the WDs and the Seagates

241
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
 behind the Synologies and the QNAPs.

242
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,000
 Their software never seemed quite as user-friendly,

243
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,160
 and if you're completely new to NAS,

244
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,920
 I've always thought you would find a very smooth transition

245
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,540
 with the Synology, but that said,

246
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,400
 I'm doing a video very, very soon

247
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,720
 that really goes through the WD MyClad software,

248
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,640
 and you will see they have made drastic improvements

249
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,980
 to that OS, and the UI is considerably better.

250
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,640
 And not just that, but given the hardware

251
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,080
 and what you're spending and what you get,

252
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,100
 and not forgetting earlier in the video,

253
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,680
 the fact that if you buy the units pre-populated,

254
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,280
 they do work out cheaper overall,

255
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
 and to you people that have come

256
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,200
 to a cost-effective NAS video, that must be important.

257
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,480
 That's why the WD MyClad, for me,

258
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,700
 is the better NAS of these two.

259
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,360
 That said, if the needs you have for NAS are ever-growing,

260
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,440
 and you're looking for a NAS to really push the boundaries

261
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,820
 of network-attached storage on a server,

262
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,340
 then do give the DS216J a look.

263
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,120
 Those extra apps, the software being more fluid,

264
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,440
 and the fact that of the two, I would say

265
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,960
 that the Synology will sync much better

266
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
 with you Mac users than the WD.

267
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,680
 That isn't to say that it won't work with Mac,

268
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,000
 but you'll just feel it vibe better in the way it works,

269
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,960
 and the way the OS feels is far more Mac-appropriate,

270
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,640
 then definitely give it a look.

271
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,360
 So, I hope you enjoyed this comparison.
