1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
 Hello again. Hello, hello. So we're going to jump into some scripture today and we're

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,600
 going to go through, we're carrying on with the book of Judges and I wanted you to turn

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:25,680
 to Judges 17 and 18. It's a strange piece of passage here and I'll confess to you, actually

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,040
 I wasn't even massively sure that I recollected the story that I'm about to read to you. It's

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,120
 likely that you won't have heard of this, a sermon on this passage before. So John 17

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,800
 and 18 is really about a guy called Micah and last week and the week before we had Pastor

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,160
 John Lee and John go through the great or at least the famous judge who is Samson and

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,600
 now we've ended up at this strange impasse in the book of Judges where the writer keeps

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,360
 telling us in those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in

10
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,400
 their own eyes and these next two chapters that I'm going to go through, I'm not going

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,880
 to have us read all of it together, but these next two chapters and the story that it tells

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,960
 is really quite a peculiar and rather ridiculous story and my prayer is that as we go through

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,680
 this as Michelle prayed, maybe quite appropriately, I hope you understand what's happening in

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,240
 this story and also the message that is coming from it as well. And I want to tell you a

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,880
 little bit about this story and you can follow along if you like as I kind of cite different

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:41,880
 verses here. And it's about a guy called Micah. Micah and he is a man who lives among the

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,020
 hills and the name Micah means who is like God. But Micah is a bit of an interesting

18
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:53,280
 man and the story starts straight away with saying that he stole money from his own mother.

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,560
 He stole 1100 pieces of silver and then he hears his mother cursing whoever stole this

20
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,280
 money. She didn't know it was him or really actually maybe she did, she was pretending.

21
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,880
 So she utters this curse out to him and says all the bad things that will happen to this

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,880
 person who stole this money. So he then confesses and then he says, "Oh mum, it was me."

23
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,180
 So chapter 17 verse 2 he says, "He said to his mother, 'The 1100 pieces of silver that

24
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,400
 were taken from you about which you uttered a curse and also spoke it in my ears, behold

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,240
 the silver is with me. I took it.'" So you have a grown man here who steals money from

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:40,800
 his own mother, hears her cursing and then goes to confess and gives it back to her.

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,760
 What's even more strange is that mum hearing her son confessing then says, "Oh," verse

28
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,400
 2 at the end, "Blessed be my son by the Lord." So she somehow praises him for stealing money

29
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,280
 and having the honesty to give it back. And then she says, "Oh thank God for my son who

30
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,320
 does this. I'm going to use the money that he gives to me to dedicate to the Lord." But

31
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,560
 he doesn't, she doesn't do the full thing either. When she gets the 1100 pieces of silver

32
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,000
 back she uses 200 and she uses it to make a carved image and a metal image. And so what

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,200
 ends up is in their house there is this shrine. He's basically creating for himself his own

34
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,400
 little tabernacle. He has a shrine, they've made an ephod and household gods and idols

35
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,320
 around. What's even more then, he ordains one of his own sons. So this tells you Micah

36
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,840
 is not a young, young, young man. He is a grown man and he ordains one of his sons to

37
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,280
 become the priest. And 17 verse 6, the writer reminds us here again, "In those days there

38
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,700
 was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes." And as if the story

39
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,840
 doesn't get even more just lame and weird, then a young man from Bethlehem is journeying

40
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,240
 and he walks around and he's a Levite. And he comes and he's looking for a place to stay.

41
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,720
 And so he goes past Micah's house and Micah meets him and goes, "You're a Levite." And

42
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,640
 I'll tell you a bit more about what a Levite was supposed to do. "You're a Levite. Why

43
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,840
 don't you come and stay with me? If you come to stay with me then I'll give you money."

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,960
 So 17 verse 10 says, "Micah said to him, 'Stay with me and be to me a father and a priest

45
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,840
 and I will give you 10 pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living.'

46
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,960
 And the Levite went in." So as he meets this Levite who's just journeying around looking

47
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,640
 for a place to stay, Micah takes him in and then Micah is now extremely chuffed with himself.

48
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,880
 Why? Because he's like, in verse 13 it says, "Now I know that the Lord will prosper me

49
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,880
 because I have a Levite as a priest." You see, the Levites were the tribe that were

50
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,520
 appointed, specially appointed and anointed to be the priests of Israel, to teach the

51
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,480
 Israelites how to worship and to teach them about God. So now Micah meets an OG priest.

52
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,960
 He meets a young man who's like, "If I have this guy in my house, my worship is going

53
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,580
 to be legit. It's going to be good and God will now bless me." Strange, right? But then

54
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,300
 it carries on getting even more weird in chapter 18. Again, 18 verse 1, "In those days there

55
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:21,480
 was no king in Israel." And now the writer talks about the tribe of people of Dan. Now

56
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,520
 the Danites, they were given a piece of land but unfortunately over the 300 years they

57
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,920
 weren't successful at kicking out the previous residents. In fact, they had stayed so they

58
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,040
 did not have any land of their own. So these Danites were also going around looking for

59
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,440
 a piece of land. And as they're walking around into the hills, they walk past Micah's house

60
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,000
 and they bump into the Levite who they would have, apparently they'd have seen before.

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,200
 And so they say, "We recognize you. Aren't you a priest?" And the Levite says, "Yeah,

62
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,040
 I'm living here now. This is my job. I basically just serve this one family and be their priest."

63
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,400
 And so these five guys from the tribe of Dan say, "Hey, could you ask God for us whether

64
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,200
 he'll be able to find us some land?" And then the Levite says, "Go. The Lord has his eye

65
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,200
 on you and go." And eventually they walk and they end up at a place called Laish. And they

66
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,200
 see that Laish is a good place. It's not really heavily guarded. It is a good place to live.

67
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,160
 So they head back home to their tribe and they gather 600 people and say, "Hey, we found

68
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,320
 a land called Laish. Let's go and invade it and let's capture it and take over it." As

69
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,440
 they're walking back to Laish to capture it, they stop by Micah's house and they're like,

70
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,920
 "Hey." The five guys that were there before, they were telling the rest of them, "Hey,

71
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,520
 this house is a bit strange. There's actually a priest there and there's loads of idols.

72
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,840
 You know, the owner of that house, Micah, he used a lot of money to make a shrine and

73
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,360
 an ephod and lots of idols. Why don't we go and ransack that place and basically burgle

74
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,200
 it and then we'll take all those idols and we'll take them into our own land." So they

75
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,440
 go up to the house, 600 men stand at the entrance. The five guys who were there before walk up

76
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,640
 to the house and start taking all the idols. The Levite priest is like, "Whoa, what's going

77
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,840
 on? Why are you coming to steal stuff?" And they tell him to keep quiet. "In fact, why

78
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,080
 don't you come with us? You know, it's better to be a priest to a whole tribe and clan than

79
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,400
 to just one house, right? Why don't you just come with us?" And then 18 verse 20 says,

80
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,720
 "And the priest's heart was glad and they left together." So they just make off and

81
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,680
 they head towards Laish. Micah comes home and finds that his house has been burgled,

82
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,080
 his priest is gone, and then he sees them from afar so he chases after them. When he

83
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,500
 gets them, he says in verse 24, chapter 18, "You take my gods that I made and the priest.

84
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,680
 What do I have left? What am I going to do?" And the people of Dan warn him, tell him,

85
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,120
 "Keep quiet, otherwise you'll get killed." And so Micah, seeing how strong they were,

86
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,280
 they leave. And pretty much that's the end of the story.

87
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,320
 Now I don't know about you, but as I was looking through this story, I thought it was a rather

88
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,520
 peculiar one about a guy called Micah who steals money from his mum, gives it back because

89
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,100
 he gets a bit scared, and then hires a Levite, and then eventually loses that Levite and

90
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,800
 all the idols that he made. And that's pretty much it. And as I'm looking at this story,

91
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,840
 I'm thinking, "What on earth is going on here?" There are so many stupid moments here. There

92
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,160
 are so many people doing strange and ridiculous things here. What do we have to learn from

93
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,480
 this? And I realised as I look at all the actions in this story, that really what we

94
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,560
 see here are a tonne of wrong motives everywhere. That there are wrong motives that lead to

95
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,120
 the wrong actions. And my question then is, how can we learn from this? How can we look

96
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,360
 at some of the motives that governs the people and the way they lived, and make sure that

97
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,600
 we don't have those same wrong motives in our hearts? And I want to split it into three

98
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,800
 separate things first. You know what? One second. My kids are screaming and I need to

99
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,760
 tell them just to be a little bit quiet. Give me five seconds. Anyway, moving on. So, the

100
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,000
 three wrong motives that we have. The three wrong motives I want to share with you today

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 are one, the wrong motive for repentance. And then the wrong motive for service. And

102
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,840
 finally, the wrong motive for worship. Repentance, service and worship. We see all of them in

103
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,200
 this story. And they all are seemingly good things, but what we see is that these actions

104
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,760
 are driven by wrong motives and that's where the problem is. And I want to start with the

105
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,680
 first one. The wrong motives for repentance. You see, Micah here steals money from his

106
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,480
 own mother and then confesses when he hears her cursing the person who steals his money.

107
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,880
 And it makes me think, actually, this isn't really true repentance. He's not confessing

108
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,880
 because of his desire to be better. He's confessing because he's heard the curse that his mother

109
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,520
 uttered. And he's afraid of the consequences that he's facing. So, it really wasn't just

110
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:59,520
 because he was feeling guilty and that he shouldn't have done it, but he was afraid

111
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:05,200
 of the consequences. And it makes me think sometimes whether we have treated God and

112
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,440
 Christianity in the same way, that we believe in God or that we go to church, not necessarily

113
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
 because how good it is, but only really because we're afraid of what the bad things could

114
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,800
 be. And there's a temptation sometimes to treat Christianity as a bit of an insurance

115
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,380
 policy. I want to be a Christian because I don't want to go to hell. So, it's an insurance

116
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,840
 policy in the sense that, oh, you know what, we should do this because we really don't

117
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,840
 want to have any of that, so we're going to kind of stick to this. But really, that isn't

118
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:39,400
 real repentance. In fact, that motive is completely wrong. You see, we don't follow Christ. We

119
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,360
 don't believe in God just because we want to avoid bad things. But sometimes we have

120
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,040
 that, right? Or sometimes we say, oh, I really should go to church because I'm afraid of

121
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,840
 what the people will think if I stop going to church. I really should do my devotions

122
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,520
 today because if I don't, God maybe won't be so kind to me. Maybe he won't bless me.

123
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:04,040
 But you see, true repentance is recognising that we're going in the wrong direction and

124
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,440
 wanting to turn around, to strive for a new direction. It's not wanting to avoid hell,

125
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,560
 but rather it's wanting to pursue heaven. See, that would be the right motive. But sometimes

126
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,520
 we have these wrong motives where we are trying to avoid the bad things. And in some ways,

127
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,920
 we've got it wrong. And you know, Micah, it looks strange what he's doing. And it's a

128
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,640
 bit of a lame story. But Micah, the name means who is like God. And really, it's an ironic

129
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,280
 name because what we're seeing here is Micah, as we see as the story goes, he himself, in

130
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:43,880
 some ways, is trying to assume the role of God. And you can see it in his heart that

131
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,360
 he is not truly recognising his own sin. And he's not truly repenting. And the question

132
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,240
 really is what is sin? You know, this passage here, and the writer here in this book is

133
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
 always saying, in those days, there was no king. Everyone did what was right in their

134
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,120
 own eyes, implying that it wasn't right. And it wasn't right in God's eyes. And sometimes

135
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:09,640
 we have this idea of sin and evil. That it's something that's kind of like maybe the Joker

136
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:16,320
 from Batman. Or maybe it's someone who just murders thousands of people or is very violent

137
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:22,240
 or there is lusting or rape. And we have all these big words when we think of sin. But

138
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,320
 actually, sin isn't just those things. Sin can actually happen in the very ordinary.

139
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,400
 Actually, this story here, there isn't really a climax. It's just a bit of a lame story

140
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,600
 about people having wrong motives. So what we see here is that sin can just be a very

141
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:44,600
 ordinary thing. It can look very lame. Really, what sin means is that we have missed the

142
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,600
 mark. We have got the wrong motives. We're thinking in the wrong way. We have fallen

143
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:59,080
 short of God's highest. That is sin. Sin is making ourselves God, thinking that we're

144
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:05,480
 in complete control. And we see when we think we're God, when we think that we're in complete

145
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,980
 control of our lives, then we're not truly repenting. Because we aren't truly understanding

146
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,840
 that without him, we are nothing. We're not understanding the true depravity of ourselves.

147
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:24,160
 And in some ways, the book of Judges is highlighting to us the depravity of man. When we think

148
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,200
 we have got everything right, and Proverbs says this, don't think that you're wise in

149
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,200
 your own eyes. Fear the Lord. But what we have with Micah in his repentance, he's not

150
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,040
 fearing the Lord necessarily. He's just fearing bad things. And there is that difference.

151
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,240
 There is a wrong motive for repentance. And the second one is this. There is a wrong motive

152
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:52,600
 for service. You see, this Levite, so he is specifically anointed to be a priest. That

153
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:59,080
 was their role, to lead the nation, to teach people how to serve God, to love God, to teach

154
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,720
 them how to worship him and to perform the rituals in the tabernacle and in designated

155
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,240
 cities across the land. But you see, this Levite ends up sojourning and looking for

156
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,200
 a place to stay. Why? We're not actually sure. We don't know. But what we can know is actually

157
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,520
 if the Levites were specifically supposed to be priests, to be serving the Lord, they

158
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,640
 would have been supported by the other tribes. But we see here that Israel as a nation was

159
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,520
 falling short in their worship when a priest is not being looked after. So he's leaving

160
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:37,120
 home because he's got no money and he's going around looking for somewhere else to serve.

161
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,480
 The problem is we're seeing that his heart, his wrong motives for service are on show

162
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,880
 as well. Because why? As soon as he reaches a house that will give him money, that will

163
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:54,600
 give him a place to stay, he accepts it. See, Micah says here, "Stay with me and be to me

164
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,040
 a father and a priest and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of

165
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,440
 clothes and your living." So as soon as someone says that, he's like, "Sure, I'll stay there.

166
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,680
 I'm looking for stability. I'm looking to be cared for." But you see, that wasn't the

167
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,920
 role of a Levite or a priest. They're not supposed to lead worship. They're not supposed

168
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:18,000
 to do their priestly duties in someone's home. They're supposed to do it in designated cities

169
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,120
 around the land. They're supposed to be leading worship services at the tabernacle. But this

170
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,520
 Levite in some ways you could say he sold out. He said, "Okay, I'll come and be your

171
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:34,600
 private priest. I'll stay with you. I'll condone you making idols. I'll speak on behalf of

172
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,480
 God even though God's not speaking through me." And so what we see here are there are

173
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:46,080
 wrong motives for service when we are not aligned with God's heart. We see here, and

174
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:52,700
 actually this speaks to me very strongly as a pastor. Because as a pastor and as leaders

175
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,980
 of the church, there's this temptation to just please the people around you. To go in

176
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:03,600
 some ways to, there are times where it feels as though we are wanting to just serve the

177
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,280
 people that we're at and actually take our eyes off God. But you see, if we are to truly

178
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,880
 serve we have to have the right motives. And I think sometimes, I don't know about you

179
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:18,140
 guys, growing up in a church or just in that kind of culture, you want to serve, you want

180
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,740
 to be in leadership, but not because you really love God, but just because of how that can

181
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,240
 help you in your own personal circumstances. How you can be respected more if you're seen

182
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,000
 as a leader in the church. How you can be admired and followed more if you are doing

183
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,680
 these acts of service. But what we see here is that when we have the wrong motives, things

184
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:42,720
 can turn upside down very, very quickly. See, this part convicts me because as a pastor

185
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,280
 and for me as a church, my prayer, and I know that the church is supposed to be almost the

186
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,280
 keeper of the standards for society around us. We're supposed to be the moral gatekeeper.

187
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:01,440
 We're supposed to show those around, outside, what God's highest really is. But often we

188
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,480
 sell out to the highest bidder. We sell out to the people who give us the most praise

189
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,360
 and we end up wanting to do what makes them happy. When really the church and its leaders,

190
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,640
 and this is including us, all of us here, those of us who are a part of the body of

191
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,120
 Christ, we have a special duty in this society that we live in. And that is to show God's

192
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:29,280
 highest and how do we live by God's standards in a world that thinks it is doing right in

193
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:36,000
 its own eyes. So it makes me question, what are my motives for serving? What am I really

194
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 doing? Am I really doing it out of a love for God? And am I truly abiding to what God

195
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,040
 has asked of me? Or am I simply doing it because people are asking me? Micah asked me to stay

196
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,800
 in his house. Oh yeah, sure, I'll do it, even though it goes against God's laws. Oh, this

197
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,920
 group of people are now asking me to go with them. Oh, maybe I'll go with them just because

198
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,400
 they like me. Is that really what it is? And so my question for all of us really is, what

199
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,000
 are your motives when it comes to serving? When it comes to being leaders in the church

200
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,840
 or being leaders in your communities, what are your motives? I mean, of course, the Levites

201
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,440
 example is a bit maybe far-fetched and a bit lame for us to even comprehend, but I think

202
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,200
 there are parallels in our own lives, in our own acts of service, where we are doing more

203
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,160
 things for the approval of man. Galatians 1.10 talks about this. Are we doing things

204
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,360
 to seek approval of man or of God? And so for us, it's very important for us to really

205
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:40,440
 search our hearts and ask, what am I doing this for? What are my motives for service?

206
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,480
 And then the final one here, which is the most important one, is the wrong motive for

207
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,560
 worship. So we've had the wrong motives for repentance and the wrong motives for service

208
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,320
 that we've seen in Micah and we've seen in the Levite. But now the big one, what we see

209
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,400
 here is that Israel as a whole and all these characters, the one thing that they've got

210
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:07,440
 wrong is worship, the wrong motives for worship. You see mum here forgives Micah for stealing

211
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,120
 money and says she's going to dedicate it all back to the Lord. She doesn't. She gets

212
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,440
 1,100 pieces of silver back and she only uses 200 pieces. And instead of dedicating it in

213
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,800
 the correct way, she ends up using those 200 pieces to make metal and carved images. If

214
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,880
 she truly understood the laws and truly understood God's heart, she would know that they're not

215
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,920
 supposed to worship images. They're not supposed to worship images in the middle of the tabernacle

216
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,840
 should be nothing because God says nothing in this world, nothing that you can create

217
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:46,880
 can represent me. So what they've actually done here, they've had a wrong motive for

218
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,680
 worship and you can see this later on. Micah 17, sorry, chapter 17, verse 13, when Micah

219
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,000
 said, "Now I know that the Lord will prosper me because I have a Levite as priest. I have

220
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,400
 someone that God has said should be a priest to be a priest in my own home. So now I know

221
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:11,160
 that the Lord will prosper me." What's he done here? He has had the wrong motive for

222
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:19,620
 worship and he has reduced God. He thinks that he can almost bribe God. As long as he

223
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,400
 has someone that God has anointed to lead the worship, he thinks that's enough for God

224
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,120
 to be pleased with him and to prosper him. So what we see here is that Micah and his

225
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,600
 mum have reduced God. They've put him into a box. They think that if they do the things

226
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,520
 that are right, that they can trick God into blessing them. My question really here is

227
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:50,320
 if they have a wrong motive for worship, what about us? Who is the God that we're worshipping?

228
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,280
 Do we think that we can also box God into the comfort of our own homes? I can imagine

229
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:01,780
 when Micah built the shrine and the ephod and all the idols, he must have sat back one

230
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,400
 evening and just looked at his place in the living room, sat on his sofa and gone, "Look

231
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,800
 at this. Look at this amazing shrine that I have built for God. And now I have my own

232
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,800
 Levite priest stood right in front of me. I have the real original thing that I'm paying

233
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,640
 for and he's here. God, are you not happy? Does this not mean that you will bless me

234
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,360
 even more?" But I wonder, and of course, I don't think any of us have a shrine of God

235
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,960
 and have hired a priest to be living in your own homes with you, but I wonder whether we

236
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:43,400
 have boxed God. I wonder whether we have reduced God to a point where we think God Almighty,

237
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,360
 creator of heaven and earth, Alpha and Omega, is actually just waiting for us at the Far

238
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,000
 East Finance Centre on a Saturday evening, that we can do life the rest of the days,

239
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,160
 however we want, because we know that God will be there when we turn up at 5.30 or maybe

240
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,080
 sometimes we're late. We'll be there at 5.35, 5.40 and God Almighty will be there waiting

241
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,360
 for us. Have we restricted God to just be in one area? Have we got the idea of worship

242
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:20,720
 wrong, where we think that we can create things to worship God in order for him to bless us,

243
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,640
 in order for us to simply tick a box? You see, Micah and his mum and the Danites who

244
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,860
 stole these images, they thought these images would be useful. They thought that having

245
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:38,560
 these things would allow them to prosper. But again, that's not the motive for worship.

246
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,680
 Just because you have these things doesn't mean that your worship is pure. And that's

247
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,040
 why God is saying, don't worship the things of this world. Don't create anything, even

248
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,880
 if you think it represents me, don't create these things because I am so far above these

249
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,700
 things. And let us not worship and obey him simply because we know that by doing that,

250
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:07,400
 we then get some good things. That isn't the point of worship. You see, Micah made all

251
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,520
 these idols and he hired a priest to run his own personal religion. When they got stolen,

252
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:21,520
 he asked, what have I got left? Isn't that such an empty spiritual condition? When we

253
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,480
 build these things in our lives and that we say that they're a testament to our relationship

254
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,000
 and admiration for God. But when our lives start to crumble around us, when these things

255
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,280
 fall apart, then we're like, oh, what have I got left? My life is so empty. That's why

256
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:45,200
 God says, do not put your faith, do not worship things that are created in this world. All

257
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,920
 those things have the ability to corrupt you, consume you. But you see, the problem is this.

258
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:58,560
 You know, it's funny, as you see the Israelites being freed from Egypt and then going into

259
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,760
 the wilderness, throughout all this time, they're talking about the promised land. They're

260
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,600
 talking about getting to this promised land full of milk and honey, where life is going

261
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,080
 to be great. But they get there and we see through the book of Judges that it is anything

262
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:21,840
 but great. Why? Because they have no king. Because their motives for worship are wrong.

263
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,000
 They think, they still have this transactional relationship with this God where they think

264
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,160
 if as long as they do these things, he will then bless them with these things. And you

265
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:39,160
 see, when you head down that line, it is so easy to adopt the practices of the world,

266
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,720
 the idols of the world. You see, some of them seem like harmless habits. Actually, the fact

267
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:52,440
 that he even spent money on these pieces of gold and metal and these ethos that they wore,

268
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,120
 it implements, it tells me that he's trying. He thinks what he's doing is right. But in

269
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:08,240
 reality, he's missed the mark. Sin is us missing the mark and missing God's highest. And you

270
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,080
 see, these habits, they often seem harmless. I don't know about for you. Sometimes for

271
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,080
 us who have been in the church for a long time, doing these things week in, week out,

272
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,600
 and just making sure these things are done. There's the worship, there's the slides, there's

273
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,680
 the message, there's all these things. Ah, it's all done. It's good. God must be pleased.

274
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,840
 But all the while, we have neglected our own hearts. All the while, we've neglected what

275
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:35,560
 the true purpose of worship was. What is really worship? You see, in the Old Testament, whilst

276
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:42,040
 we're here, we know the very first just description of the word worship is Abraham in Genesis

277
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,280
 22, telling his helpers, you wait here, I'm going to go up the mountain with Isaac, and

278
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,360
 we're going to worship there. And how's he worshipping? He is willing to sacrifice everything.

279
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:58,160
 The word worship is proskuneo, and it means ascribing worth. It's saying, if I worship

280
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,680
 this thing, I'm saying that it is more worthy than anything else. It is of the highest worth.

281
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:11,320
 I'm willing to sacrifice everything I have for this thing. And God's saying, I'm the

282
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:19,000
 only one that you should worship. Don't put any idols, don't put any images in replacement

283
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:28,640
 of me. But you see, the thing is this. The throne is to be left empty, but not forever.

284
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,320
 Because in Scripture, if we fast forward to the New Testament, to Colossians in 115, we

285
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,980
 see that there is an image that is coming, that is worthy of our worship, that is worthy

286
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,880
 to be praised. And Colossians 115 says this, he is the image of God. Jesus Christ is the

287
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,000
 image of the invisible God, for by him all things were created, whether thrones or powers

288
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,600
 or rulers or authorities. God's saying, don't put anything else there, because soon, one

289
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:05,840
 day, there will be someone there who will be worthy of all your worship. And this person,

290
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,960
 of course, is Jesus. Jesus modelled to us and showed us what true sacrifice was like,

291
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,760
 what true worship was like, that he was willing to give himself up for us and to show us what

292
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:26,040
 pure worship is like. And he's showing us that we need to search our own hearts, that

293
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:31,880
 we need to give him our all, that we don't withhold anything from him, that we give him

294
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:39,340
 everything. You see, we see in this story here are just humans doing things that they

295
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:47,300
 think are right by their own standards, but still holding things back, only doing things

296
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:51,200
 because they think it makes sense, because this will help benefit them, because this

297
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,920
 will help prosper them. But true worship, Jesus showed us this, true worship is laying

298
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:08,200
 down our lives for the one whom all things were created for, God himself. And so the

299
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,640
 question really for us is, and I came across this quote the other day, the question that

300
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,440
 we have to ask ourselves when we're searching our own hearts, searching our own motives

301
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:28,000
 is not what have I already given, but rather, what am I holding back? What am I still holding

302
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,160
 back? I don't know about you, but if you look at your life and you're thinking, actually,

303
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,360
 you know what, I'm doing these things, they're good things. I am giving this to God. I am

304
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,400
 doing this thing to God. I have repented. I've repented when I first turned to Christ

305
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,360
 20 years ago. I'm still serving in the church. I'm still doing these things. I'm still giving

306
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,000
 money to the church and doing this, that, the other. The question really isn't what

307
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,840
 have we given? The question really is, what are we still holding back? When we get that

308
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:07,320
 in our minds, when we understand the magnitude of God, then we will start to understand who

309
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,280
 he is. And when we start to understand who he is, then we will finally have the right

310
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,340
 motive for repentance because we'll realise that we can't get anywhere near him because

311
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,080
 he's that pure. You know, Peter, when he first meets Jesus, what does he say? "Depart from

312
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,160
 me, Lord. Get away from me because I am a sinner. Just don't." In the face of holiness,

313
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,240
 Peter just crumbles and just wants to hide away. Moses did the same thing when he's getting

314
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,360
 near the glory of God. When we truly are up close and personal with God, we will truly

315
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,400
 realise how far we fall short. And that is what leads us to repentance because we're

316
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,360
 saying, "God, what I am is not enough, but I want you. I want all of you. I want to pursue

317
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,280
 you." That is the true and good motive for repentance. And then that should then overflow

318
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,880
 into our service so that we serve not because we want to look good or maybe even just satisfy

319
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,280
 our own conscience. "I'm doing these things which makes me a good Christian." No, we do

320
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:14,480
 these things because we have this love for God and that flows into a love for people

321
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,000
 and service. So we need to check our own hearts that we are even doing service for the right

322
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:27,020
 reasons and for us then to have a true and good motive for worship, recognising who he

323
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:33,600
 is, recognising that he is our King. This book of Judges is just constantly saying,

324
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:42,320
 "Israel had no king." And what it's really saying is God is supposed to be the King.

325
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:50,640
 If we truly grasped that God is our King, then we would have the right motives for worship.

326
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:57,480
 And I want to finish with just this question for us as we worship and as we go into breakout

327
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:05,800
 groups to share and talk more is, let us search our hearts now. What motives do we have that

328
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:12,160
 dictates the way we behave? What motives do we have? And that's where Psalm 139 comes

329
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:20,000
 in. "Search my heart, O God. Test my thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me."

330
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,280
 That, praying that prayer in the Psalms, that is what is going to separate us from the people

331
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:33,440
 in the book of Judges. Because we're not really any better than them. Even though it looks

332
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,360
 like they're doing very silly things, we're not really any better than them. But what

333
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:45,840
 will separate us is when we remember to look to God and say, "God, you are our King. And

334
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:53,120
 I repent and I serve you and the people around me and I worship you with all my heart, soul

335
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:00,000
 and mind." So my question is this, what are your motives in life? Let's pray.

336
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,680
 So God, we come before you and we ask you to search our hearts and test our thoughts.

337
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:17,680
 But it's so easy to measure our standards or our levels of Christianity based on the

338
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:25,800
 world standards of how productive we are and how effective we are. And we are constantly

339
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:34,040
 living to seek the approval of man. But God, we bow before you and we remember this story

340
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:41,080
 of Micah, his mother, the Levite and the Danites, who were trying to do things right in their

341
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:47,640
 own eyes, to get the right idols, to get the right people, to get the right shrine, but

342
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:57,680
 missing the mark. And I pray, Lord, humbly and sincerely that you would show all of us

343
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:05,080
 the way. That we would not miss the mark, but rather that we would understand your heart

344
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:13,960
 for us and how we should live now. Take us back, Lord, to the heart of the heart of the

345
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,280
 national prayer. Thank you.
