[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Doing a great job.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   And he did a great job for us last week,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   telling us about the Father's heart, the Father's heart.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   And the Father so loved the world that he sent his one and only son,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   and that is Jesus, to us as an example for us.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And today we're going to learn about Jesus and the leper.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   A couple years ago, I went to India.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Actually, that was one of the mission trips I went to.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Has anybody been to India before?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   You may have been to India before.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   And just like Russell Peter says, when you go to India,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   your senses come alive.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Okay?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Your sense of smell, the things you see, the things you hear.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   You could be crossing the road with goats and oxes,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   and the street just stops for goats.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   It's not for goats, for oxes, for cows.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   There's such poverty there as well, and it really opens your eyes and your ears.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I remember one time I was riding the trains.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Trains are a crazy experience as well.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Have you been to one of the trains?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Yeah, you have to, like, rush in and, like, basically body check your way in
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   because there's lots of people.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Imagine the MTR times 10.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Okay?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   The MTR times 10.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And to get out, you've got to push your way out near the door
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   so that you get out the next exit
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   because on the next exit, do you know who's coming in?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Grandmas are just coming in.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   Grandpas are coming in.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   They don't care who's there.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   They're coming in.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So you've got to be right at the exit to get out.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Okay?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   This was my India experience.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   It was crazy.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And I remember one time I was just at the trains,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   and it was exactly just like this.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I saw tons of garbage just everywhere.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And I was talking with one of my Indian friends who was a student,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   and I was like, "How come people are just throwing trash there?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   How come people don't pick it up?"
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And he's like, "Oh, there's only certain people to pick this up,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and they're actually called the Dalits,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and they're the caste, the untouchable caste."
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And in the next slide, you'll see that there's a caste system in India,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   and the Dalits are on the bottom.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   And a lot of them are street cleaners,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   and they have simple tasks, very simple tasks.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   And a lot of them are actually abused and looked down upon.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   One quote says this,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   "Dalits are not allowed to drink from the same wells,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   attend the same temples,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   wear shoes in the presence of the upper caste,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   or drink from some cups in some tea stalls.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Dalits are looked down upon.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   They're the untouchables.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   They're expected to clean up the garbage.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   They're expected to be low."
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I remember I was in University of Toronto,
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   and well, before I wasn't paid to play basketball,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   and now I am.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   So in the next slide, you'll see the University of Toronto.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I played on Division 1.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   There's four divisions, okay, and I played Div 1.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And Div 1, most people were at least six feet, six feet tall.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And so I joined--I was able to make my team
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   because they were the worst team, all right?
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   They were the untouchable team, untouchable team.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And I was the shortest--I was one of the shortest guys on this team.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And because I didn't live on campus, I didn't go to practice,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   and so they put me very far down the bench, okay?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I remember this one time, the coach subbed me in,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   and I played for 30 seconds, and then he subbed me out.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   And he was like, "Good minute."
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And I'm like, "Yeah, good minute."
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I was like, "I played a minute."
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I was just like, "Come on."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   I was like the untouchable on this untouchable team.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Now, not the untouchable where you can't trade a person,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   where he's so valuable he's untouchable.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I'm untouchable where you only play him 30 seconds
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   just to say that he participated,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   just so that, you know, he can be happy for a little bit.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   And so I was the untouchable on this team.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   JP knows what it means to be untouchable.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Let's read Mark 1 together, the story we just saw on the video.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Let's read the scripture together.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   One, two, three.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   "A man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   'If you are willing, you can make me clean.'
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Jesus was enigmate.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   He reached out his hand and touched the man.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   'I am willing,' he said. 'Be clean.'"
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Leprosy.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Does anybody know anybody with leprosy today?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   You do.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   It's not that common anymore because we have a cure for it.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   We have a cure for it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   The symptoms of leprosy are it's an infectious disease
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   caused by mycobacterium lyprae.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   It affects the skin.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   It affects your nerves.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Has anybody have nerves that are numb, that they can't--
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Have you ever felt like you couldn't feel your hands before?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's a little too cold?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   This is what happens when it gets worse.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You sort of lose your feelings on your toes and your hands.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Due to injury, they can lose their hands and their toes.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   If it even gets worse, it could affect your breathing.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Some people can lose their eyes, literally lose their eyes.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   If you have leprosy, what you would do nowadays
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   is you would go to a doctor.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   It's a medical problem.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   It's a bacterial infectious disease that you have.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And it's transmitted by droplets.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Speaking, when we had this huge plexiglass thing
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   to prevent COVID, similar.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It was transmitted by droplets.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   But nowadays, if you get leprosy, it's curable.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   It's okay, especially in the early stages.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   You don't have to be disabled.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   You don't have to lose your eyes.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   There is a cure.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   There is a cure.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Now, here are some pictures of leprosy.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   I chose the most decent ones for you guys.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   In the early stages, it could cause blemishes in your skin.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And in the later stages, it could cause your fingers,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   because of the nerve damages to your nerves.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   It could cause your fingers and your feet to go.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Now, do you know the history of leprosy in the Bible?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Who was the first person to have leprosy?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Anybody know?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Haman?
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Naaman, yes.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Naaman, yes, he had leprosy.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And he was miraculously healed, right?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Elijah told him to go to the Jordan River.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   But there was a person before that.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Miriam, that's right.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Do you know why Miriam got leprosy?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Do you know why he got leprosy?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   Because he was on his phone while the sermon was happening.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Is that right?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Is that what was happening?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I see you guys, don't worry.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   I see you.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   No, that wasn't the reason, all right?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   It wasn't the reason.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Let's read it.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   I'll just read it for you.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of his wife.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   The woman that he married was not an Israelite, all right?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   He was a Cushite.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   They said to him, "Has the Lord indeed spoken only through Moses?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Has he not spoken through us also?"
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And the Lord heard it.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   The Lord heard it.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   What was the Lord's response?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Let's see.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   "Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   And he departed when the cloud removed from the tent, over the tent.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Behold, Miriam was leprous like snow.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And Aaron turned towards Miriam.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And behold, she was leprous.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And Aaron said to Moses, 'Oh, my Lord, do not punish us because of what we have
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   done foolishly and have sinned.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Let her be as one dead whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   mother's womb.'
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   And Moses cried to the Lord, 'Oh, Lord, please heal her.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Please.'
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   But the Lord said to Moses, 'If her father had but spit on her face,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   should she not be ashamed seven days, let her be shut outside the camp seven
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   days.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   And after that, she may be brought in again.'
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   So Miriam was shut outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not set
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   out on the march till Miriam was brought back in again."
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   How many days did Miriam have leprosy?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Seven days.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   How many days was she in isolation?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Seven days outside the camp, isolated.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   That was the command of the Lord.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Some people called this disease back then the touch of God because it was the touch
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   of God that gave the disease, and it is the touch of God that can take away this
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   disease.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Back then, leprosy, same sort of symptoms, dry, patchy, crusty patches of skin.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   However, back then, they didn't go to a doctor for a diagnosis.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And why was that?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Because they believed this was not just a physical problem.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   This was a spiritual problem.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   What did Miriam do?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   What was her sin?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   What did she do?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   What did she do?
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Should we read it again?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Should we read it again?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   She spoke against Moses, God's servant.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   So back then, they thought it was a spiritual disease.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   If you were gossiping, if you were speaking condemnation against people,
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   the disease would come out through your skin.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   That was their belief back then, okay?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And this was evident through Miriam.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Miriam.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   And so what happened?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   What was the result?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Nowadays, we can take medicine and get a cure for leprosy.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Back then, it resulted in a loss of your job.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   No more teaching.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   No more dentistry.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   No more finance.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   No more computer science.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   No more law.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   No more student.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Loss of your job.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   You lose your family.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   You're isolated from the camp.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Not just seven days.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   Okay?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Not just seven days.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   There's a special place in Israel for these people.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   A contamination place.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Quarantine place.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Who liked quarantine?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Who did 21--okay, Julian likes quarantine.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Who did seven days of quarantine?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Who did seven days of quarantine?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   How was it?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   It was okay?
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Survivable?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Torture in Shijin?
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Yeah?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Okay.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Okay, no windows.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   They closed--okay.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   You didn't get a room with a window?
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Okay.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   They didn't want people to see freedom.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   It's actually better, I think, because I got a big window,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   and I saw people running, jumping, playing basketball,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   and I was just like, "Five more days.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Four more days."
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Playing basketball with the wall.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Football with the wall.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Kicking it against the wall.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Who did 14 days?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   14 days was okay?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Survivable?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   21 days.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Wow, these guys.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   These guys.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   21 days.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   How was it in isolation?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Oh, you had your wife.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   It might be worse.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   For Sandra, not for you.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Okay, they had a huge place.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   They could run around, do laps.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Five at Pulong's, okay.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Imagine leprosy, quarantine.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Not just seven days, not just 14 days.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Knowing that you had a hope that you would get out.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   21 days, at least you're working towards that last day.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   There's hope that you would get out.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Leprosy?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Did people really have a hope?
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   They didn't.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And as things got worse and worse,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   from patches of your skin to losing your fingers
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   to losing your feet to not being able to see,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   to not being able to breathe, to losing your nose,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   was hope getting stronger and stronger?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   It wasn't.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   It was getting worse.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Despair.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Isolation.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Loneliness.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And it says here that the priest was to examine them
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   for dull spots.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And what would happen?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   If the priest saw that they had leprosy,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   they would be forced to go out, outside to the camp.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   You can read Leviticus 13 for the details.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And also, not only were you to have isolation from society,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   it says in verse 45, let's read 45 together.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Can we go to 45?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Ready?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   One, two, three.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Anyone with such a defiling disease must wear torn clothes,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   left their hair be unkept, cover the lower part of their face,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   and cry out, unclean, unclean.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   As they have the disease, they remain unclean.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   They must live alone.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   They must live outside the camp.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Imagine when you had COVID.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   You had to cry, unclean, unclean, on the MTR.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   How would it be?
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Everybody would run away, right?
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Okay.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   This is what lepers had to do when they stepped out of their quarantine zone.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   And they were amongst people that were clean.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   They had to cry out, unclean, unclean, like a sign.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I'm diseased. I'm unclean.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Beware.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Beware.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And so this man in this story where he approached Jesus,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   he begged him on his knees, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Have you ever begged for something?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   You were so desperate for something.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Maybe it's your child that is sick, and you're so desperate.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   I remember in Canada, it was like -30 one day, -40 sometimes,
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   and our heater broke.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   And our heater broke, and I started to develop a fever.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Okay?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   And you know what my mom did?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   My mom was like, "Come and fix the heater now!
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   My son is sick!
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   She's just like fighting for me!"
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   You know?
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Like, I was going to die from fever in -40.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   She was just so desperate for her child, for me.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Have you ever been desperate for something?
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   So desperate.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Maybe it's your exam marks.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   So desperate.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   God, help me to get this mark so I can go to university.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Maybe it's for a job.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Maybe it's for a relationship.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Have you been so desperate?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   This was this man.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   So desperate.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   In a parallel passage in Luke, it says this.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Luke was a doctor.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   His diagnosis, covered in leprosy.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Possibly, he's in the late stages of his life.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   He's desperate.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Covered with leprosy.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   He came in desperation.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   He came in violation.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   He's violating the laws of Moses.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   In Leviticus 13, it says, "You should live outside the camp."
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   In Leviticus 13, it says, "You should cry unclean."
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Unclean, unclean, unclean.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   When you see people that are clean and you're approaching them,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   he is living in violation.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And lastly, he's seeking compassion.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Can you imagine five years of quarantine?
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Without windows.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   It's very bad.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   It's very bad.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Could it be 20 years in isolation?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I can't imagine it.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   This person, what is this?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   In his late stages.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   We don't know how many years or how much time exactly.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   He pleads to Jesus, "If you are willing, you can make me clean."
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   It shows us that this leper had heard about Jesus.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   In Mark, he had healed.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   In Mark, he had cast out demons.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   So possibly he had heard about these healings.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   He had heard about the casting out of demons.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   In the video, we heard that this man say, the leper say,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   "Oh, I heard about what you did at the wedding.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   You turned water into wine.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   The healings.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   That's how I know of you."
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Did Jesus approach this person with fear?
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Was he fearful?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   The disciples were, right?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   "Don't breathe the air.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Run away.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Step back."
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Right?
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   They approached with fear.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   This man was unclean, diseased, an outcast, in isolation.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   And Jesus decides to heal him by touching.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Jesus could have healed by any way.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Spoken, sang, be healed.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   He could have healed by sending a letter or whatever.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   He could have done anything, right?
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Email, a text, you're healed.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Don't worry.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   I'm willing.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   LOL.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Not LOL.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   But Jesus chooses to heal by touch to a person who is untouchable.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   Untouchable.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   From unclean, he was made clean.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   From disease, there was healing.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   From an outcast, for the first time, there was acceptance.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   From isolation, he revealed his presence to this person.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   This man was seeking physical healing.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   And not only did Jesus give him physically healing,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   ultimately he would give spiritual healing.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   The healing of his soul.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   An untouchable person was touched by an extraordinary man named Jesus.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   And his touch infected the leper.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   The most infectious person in this story is not the leper.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Who is it?
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   It's Jesus.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   Jesus is the most infectious person.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   His love, his healing, his touch, his presence, his words,
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   he is the most infectious person in this story.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Have you thought about that?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Jesus is amazing.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   His spiritual touch.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   And then Jesus says to him, let's continue and finish the story here.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   One, two, three.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   See that you don't tell this to anyone.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   But go, show yourself to the priest,
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   and offer the sacrifices that Moses commanded for your cleansing
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   as a testimony to them.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Continue.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Instead, he went out and began to talk freely, spreading the news.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   As a result, Jesus could no longer enter the town openly
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   and stayed outside in lonely places.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Yet the people still came to him from everywhere.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   So Jesus wasn't like, oh, go share, you know, because his time had not come.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   His time had not come.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And if you continue to read in the Gospels, you'll see why.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   But Jesus tells him, interestingly, to obey the law of Moses.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And the law of Moses says this in Leviticus 14.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   The priest is to go outside the camp and examine the person who has leprosy.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   If they have been healed of their defiling skin disease,
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   the priest shall order two live, clean birds
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   and some cedar wood, scarlet yarn, and hyssop
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   be brought before the person to be cleansed.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Then the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   over fresh water in a clay pot.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   He is then to take the live bird and dip it, together with the cedar wood,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   the scarlet yarn, and the hyssop, into the blood of the bird
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   that was killed over fresh water.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Seven times shall he sprinkle the one to be cleansed of the defiling disease
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   and pronounce them clean.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   After that, he is to release the live bird in the open fields.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   What does this sound like?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Two birds, and then you have a piece of cedar wood,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   hyssop, and then scarlet yarn.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Scarlet yarn, what color was scarlet yarn usually?
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Red. Scarlet yarn, red.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Let's see the next picture.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   A bird tied to cedar wood with scarlet yarn,
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   and hyssop is used for cleaning.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   What do you think it represents?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   It represents Jesus, what Jesus did for us on the cross.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   He took the punishment.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   He paid the price so that the other bird could go free.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   It's so symbolic of what Jesus had done.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   He tells the man, "Go and make a sacrifice,"
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   because this actually foreshadows what I'm doing on earth.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Not just healing people physically,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   but ultimately healing people spiritually.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Today, this weekend is Father's Day.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   This is a picture of me and my parents.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   We were in Japan.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Obviously, my dad's a Messi fan.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Although he did not jump out of the stadium to hug Messi
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   like somebody in China did yesterday,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   there was some YouTube video of that.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   I remember a time when I was a child.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Everybody has been a child.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   I remember a time when I was a child.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   I was at church, and my dad is a pastor.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   There were huge expectations.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   "Pastor's kid, you've got to be perfect,"
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   the second coming of Jesus.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Joking.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   That's what somebody actually said to me, though.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I'm very active.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I'm competitive.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   When I was a kid, I was also the same and energetic.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Somehow, we were playing shooting rubber bands.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   Somehow, I was really good at it.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I lit up this guy like he was Christmas.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   He had some bruises from rubber bands.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   We were pretending we were doing CS.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   There was no CS back then.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   I'm just using a modern-day example.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   We were pretending we were playing Counter-Strike,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   just shooting each other.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Because there were some marks on him from rubber bands,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   his sister got mad.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   His sister was like, "What am I going to tell my parents?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   I brought you to church for the first time,
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   and you got lit up by the pastor's kid."
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   I remember going back to the house,
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   and my parents explaining this to me.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   I was hiding in a dark room.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   I'm also very good at hiding.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   What do you mean?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   This guy, naughty.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   I was hiding because I was like, "Oh, no.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   I don't know if my parents will love me.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   I don't know if the church will accept me."
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   These are things that come in a pastor's kid's head.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   "I don't know.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Maybe this person will never go to church again,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   and I've spiritually condemned them for the rest of my life."
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   These are some of the thoughts that go through your head
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   as a pastor's kid.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   I remember I was hiding,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   and finally my parents realized I was gone,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   and they were crying out, "Johnny, Johnny, where are you?"
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   I was behind the door of this room,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and when my dad stepped in, I pushed him.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I pushed him.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   I was like, "Leave me alone."
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   I was like, "You don't want me anymore."
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   You know what my dad said?
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   You know what my dad said?
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   My dad said, "When did I ever say that I didn't want you?"
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   When he said that, I knew I was accepted.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   I was loved.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   I did something wrong, not really knowing,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   but I knew my dad loved me.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   That is what Jesus is.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   That is what the story of the prodigal son is.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Each one of us have done something wrong.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Each one of us have something wrong with us.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Maybe we're broken.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Maybe we're lost.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   Maybe we're struggling to find meaning.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Maybe we have a physical illness.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Maybe we have a mental illness.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Each of us are broken in our own way.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Just like that prodigal son's father,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   he is waiting at the doorstep for us to return.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Maybe you've been struggling with something.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   I don't know what it is.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Something you've done, something you're going through.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   God knows what you're going through.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   "When did I ever say I didn't want you?"
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   God never said that.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   It was my own lie in my head.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   "They'll never want me.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   They'll kick me out.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   I'll have to run away."
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   God never said that.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   "When did I ever say I didn't want you?"
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Is there anywhere in the Bible that says that?
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   No.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   God is a God of love.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   He knows our need.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   He knows our situation.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   And in the last song that we're going to sing tonight,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   the chorus says this.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   "I run to the Father.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   I step into grace.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   I'm done with the hiding.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   No reason to wait.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   My heart needs a surgeon.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   My soul needs a friend.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   So I'll run to the Father again and again and again."
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Let me just pray for us.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Let's just close our eyes.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   Is there anybody right now tonight that's just going through something,
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   going through a struggle?
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   They're feeling lost.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   They're feeling broken.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   They're feeling isolated like that leper.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   And they're in need of a touch, not just any touch but a spiritual touch,
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   a touch that only Jesus can provide.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Jesus, the most infectious person in the world, with his love,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   he wants to consume you with his love, with his acceptance, with his grace.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Let us come and run to the Father.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Let us be known by him.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Father, I pray for each one of us.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   We're all broken, lost in some way.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   We need your healing, not just once but a constant healing.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   We thank you that you know our need, you know what we're going through,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   and that you are willing, and that you have already paid the ultimate price.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   We thank you, Jesus.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   And the church said, "Amen."
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   Let us stand.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   [music]
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.580]   (gentle music)
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.580]   [MUSIC]
