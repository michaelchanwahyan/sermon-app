1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
 (silence)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,240
 Actually, I just want to say thank you guys

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,620
 for having me here tonight,

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,880
 because it's such an honor to actually stand here

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,080
 and share with you guys.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,000
 It's not my comfort zone,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,720
 but I know God's standing here by His Holy Spirit,

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,480
 and He's prepared me to share a word in season for you.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,080
 So I just want to pray over us at the moment,

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,000
 just to, Father, you just prepare our hearts

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 just for the word that you have

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
 for everyone in this room tonight

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,160
 about your unconditional love

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,840
 that is beyond our understanding.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,120
 It's supernatural, and it is amazing.

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,360
 We thank you again in Jesus' name.

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,960
 There should be a picture coming up.

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,640
 So if you can't see it,

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,560
 this was John's birthday in April,

20
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,600
 and we had a family brunch.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,760
 There's one person missing,

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,860
 which is another mom in our family,

23
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,960
 and that was Sam, our eldest daughter-in-law,

24
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,040
 who was born in Hong Kong,

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,480
 but she had another engagement.

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,240
 But this is basically the Snell Groves.

27
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,520
 So we came with four, so we have two sons,

28
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,260
 and now we have 11 of us in Hong Kong.

29
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,520
 So Snell Groves around Hong Kong, you notice them.

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,040
 So actually, if you look up there,

31
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,960
 I don't know how many generations you can basically see.

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,840
 There's three.

33
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,960
 So there's three generations there

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,600
 with the love of a family running right the way through,

35
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,800
 through a father and a mother, which is us,

36
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,400
 and we've become grandparents

37
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,740
 to these wonderful grandkids here,

38
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,000
 who range from the age of eight to 16.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,020
 So yes, we've got a whole 'nother generation ahead of us

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,500
 coming up and running.

41
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,300
 The love of the family.

42
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,520
 We've had our ups and downs,

43
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
 but you know, in the middle of all this,

44
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,080
 there's so many stories I can tell you,

45
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,200
 but I'll tell you them another day.

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,320
 And during through all this time,

47
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,480
 I know that my heavenly father was with me unconditionally

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,720
 as we walked through bringing up these two boys,

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,680
 and then the families that we're so proud of,

50
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,680
 and we're proud of our boys and their wives.

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,200
 The love is unconditional,

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,640
 and it's an unconditional love of the mother.

53
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,520
 And I can tell you now that these boys

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,280
 will always be on my heart.

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,120
 You know, the saying is that it's always a mother

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,880
 that holds the hand of a child,

57
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,940
 but the hand is only for a while.

58
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,080
 The heart is forever.

59
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,320
 So they're always in my heart as little boys,

60
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,600
 as probably like you are with your parents.

61
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,760
 And through this,

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,620
 God gives us a picture of God's love for us.

63
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,760
 Isaiah 66, 13, which should be on the screen, yeah.

64
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,280
 It's a mother comforts a child,

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,300
 so I will comfort you and you will be comforted.

66
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,080
 I have a great dad.

67
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,160
 And my mom died, passed away 28 years ago,

68
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,960
 and I'm only child.

69
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,920
 So my dad is very precious to me.

70
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,800
 He turned 90, sorry, 90 on Easter Sunday.

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,720
 And sometimes when I was growing up as a little girl,

72
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,320
 he was very, very strict.

73
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,040
 I have a bit of feedback coming there, go on.

74
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,100
 Good to get feedback, exactly.

75
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:39,640
 So with my dad, when I was a little girl,

76
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,680
 I can always remember him coming home

77
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,120
 from a really hard day at work.

78
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,960
 He really worked hard to keep us in a home.

79
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,680
 And he'd come home, he'd sit in his armchair,

80
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,720
 and he'd kick off his shoes.

81
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,960
 And as a little girl of about five or six,

82
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,240
 even a little bit older,

83
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,800
 I used to climb up on his lap and I used to sit there,

84
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,040
 and I'd have all these questions,

85
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,160
 and questions of our day together.

86
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,720
 And there was loads of questions.

87
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,920
 And as I'm asking, and he's answering,

88
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,160
 and he's loving this time with his daughter,

89
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,280
 but he was getting a little bit tired and angry.

90
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,200
 He'd been working from sort of 7.30 in the morning

91
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,280
 to 6.30 at night, standing up.

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,400
 It was just really tiring for him.

93
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,160
 And I could see him getting a little bit angry.

94
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,200
 Well, then my mum had come in the room.

95
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,120
 She'd get in the middle and she'd say,

96
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
 "Right, get to your room."

97
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
 And then she'd make sure that I'd stay in my room

98
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,920
 for another hour, to give dad a bit of peace and quiet,

99
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,600
 and then we'd have our tea together.

100
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,000
 That was like a feeling, I was okay with that.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,760
 And just to say that my, don't get me wrong,

102
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,320
 but my dad actually was, he wouldn't hurt anybody.

103
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,160
 He wouldn't even eat a fly or anything like that.

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,160
 So, but we need to remember, like my dad,

105
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,760
 that human dads, they can be good, or not so good,

106
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,800
 but we're only human.

107
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,640
 And my dad obviously had to have his time of rest as well.

108
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,080
 So that little story was a bit like

109
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,960
 my mum coming in to rescue me.

110
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,640
 So there's a little bit of the unconditional love

111
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,920
 from my mum looking after me,

112
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,360
 but then giving dad that little time out.

113
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,240
 But we see that Father God has our backs

114
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,800
 in every part of our lives.

115
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,800
 We don't always see or feel that he's there, but he is.

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,960
 He knows us before our parents knew us.

117
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,320
 That's actually a mind-boggling thought.

118
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,720
 But, you know, he always is there.

119
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,080
 And I know that when I was a little girl, another story.

120
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,200
 When I was a little girl, I was about 10,

121
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,800
 and I didn't really know Jesus at that time.

122
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
 I heard of God, I believed if God was existed.

123
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,720
 I was at school with assemblies in school every morning

124
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,480
 and hymns and things like that.

125
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,840
 Well, where I lived, I went over to visit my auntie

126
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,920
 and on the back of her garden was this huge park area

127
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,160
 with a river and arches.

128
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,240
 And I was told never to go over there,

129
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,640
 never to go out alone.

130
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,400
 You never know who's about.

131
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,360
 Well, one afternoon I decided to go over there

132
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,080
 with my friend and explore.

133
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,960
 And we went down to the river

134
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,200
 and we went down to see the swans.

135
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,760
 And all of a sudden we could hear rustling in the grass.

136
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,840
 Now, I don't know who it was, if somebody was watching us,

137
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,680
 but did we run.

138
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,240
 I had one friend with me and we ran so fast,

139
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,160
 we headed for the little chapel

140
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,160
 that was at the end of the other side of this amazing park.

141
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,920
 Well, I sat in that, I can remember it now,

142
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,680
 I sat in that pew and I just said,

143
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,280
 "God, if you're there, just put your protection over me."

144
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
 And sure enough, I just believed at that moment in time,

145
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,040
 God sowed a seed in me,

146
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,240
 that the father's germinated that in my heart

147
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,320
 as I've been growing up.

148
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,000
 It's still growing, it's still forming in me,

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,640
 even from that moment.

150
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,400
 And I believe that it helped me to mother my children

151
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,200
 and it also to the Kingdom family,

152
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,480
 which now over the years I would never have foreseen.

153
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,720
 It's an amazing family that's worldwide.

154
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,000
 I could tell you many stories on that one too.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,320
 But I'm not saying that all mothers have brought love

156
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,640
 and nurturing to their children.

157
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,640
 Some people say, "I don't have a problem with my dad,

158
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,880
 "but I do with my mum."

159
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,000
 (audience laughing)

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,800
 Yeah, I do hear that quite often actually.

161
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,040
 And whether we have difficulty opening our hearts

162
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,600
 to the masculine figure or a feminine figure,

163
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,040
 we really deep down want to enjoy that tender love

164
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,560
 that comforts and nurtures us.

165
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,560
 You know, love is a response and it is to love.

166
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,960
 And we only have to look at to nature.

167
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
 If we look on the screen,

168
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,280
 there should be the wonderful picture

169
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
 of all the little cutie things that we see.

170
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,920
 So we got the sheep and the lamb

171
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,120
 and we see the little ducklings.

172
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,040
 Where's mum?

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,440
 She's gone, disappeared.

174
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,240
 There's the chicks without the chicken,

175
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,200
 but then the horse with the foal.

176
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,600
 And basically what this picture says to me

177
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,360
 is that in creation,

178
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,280
 mums, whatever animal, whatever we see around us,

179
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,920
 and they have their youngsters,

180
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,800
 they will nurture those young ones.

181
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,560
 And they will feed them and they will look after them.

182
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,280
 And you know, I actually personally see God

183
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,880
 around in creation.

184
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,480
 So I don't just see these animals,

185
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
 I just see the smallest insect sometimes.

186
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,720
 Or you see the famous butterfly.

187
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,200
 Where does that come from?

188
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,560
 Of course, the caterpillar to the chrysalis

189
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,760
 to the butterfly.

190
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,720
 So there's a whole world out there that God created.

191
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
 And it was his love of setting it in motion from day one.

192
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,160
 So looking at these guys here,

193
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,600
 I'm sure that they only have that little time together

194
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,680
 and then they become adults.

195
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,320
 And I think that's what we see with a lot of animals.

196
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,920
 But for us as humans, our children are with us.

197
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,640
 And as I said, they're in our heart all the time,

198
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
 even though not physically with us.

199
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,760
 But I don't know if you see love around you.

200
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,520
 I definitely do.

201
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,360
 I definitely see it in lots of ways.

202
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,720
 And as a grandma, you look at your grandkids,

203
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,800
 but then you also look at other children when they're out.

204
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,920
 Because nurturing in my heart as a mum

205
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,400
 has allowed me to see children.

206
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,240
 You know, we've got Reuven and AJ down here

207
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,360
 and I've watched them grow up in the last few years.

208
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,640
 When they were little, now they're bigger.

209
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,520
 But I see them interacting with their parents.

210
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,280
 And I see that and I just thought,

211
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,480
 hmm, they're gonna grow up too quick.

212
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,400
 Really take the moment with them

213
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,600
 because every moment will never come again.

214
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,280
 So mums, new mums, nurture those babies.

215
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,320
 You might have to go nights of crying and whatever

216
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,280
 and feeding, but you know what?

217
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,600
 You'll never get it again.

218
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,920
 Not with that child, anyway.

219
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,560
 And it's important as we celebrate Mother's Day.

220
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,440
 I say, listen to this.

221
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,440
 We refer to God as father and we pray to our father.

222
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,640
 But did we know that God the father

223
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,200
 displays not only a masculine quality,

224
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,960
 but we see him to be having a nurturing heart.

225
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,640
 Or as a mother as well,

226
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,800
 is from the side of God's personality

227
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,600
 that enables us as a mother to be able

228
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,360
 to offer unconditional love to our offspring,

229
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,960
 no matter what the situation is.

230
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,640
 And it's always there.

231
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,040
 And as a mother,

232
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,720
 the whole is whole enough within herself.

233
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,080
 She's the one who teaches her children

234
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,720
 how to both love and be loved.

235
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,000
 As a human being, we have to be taught everything.

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,520
 Do you remember when you, maybe you don't remember,

237
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,280
 your parents definitely remember,

238
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,040
 how you learnt to walk?

239
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,200
 You might've crawled and pulled yourself on the sofa

240
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,400
 and had the wobbly steps along

241
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,640
 and then one day you stepped out on your own

242
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,920
 and you started to walk.

243
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,800
 Then the first word, was it mama or dada?

244
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,240
 Who knows?

245
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,760
 That you start to learn to talk.

246
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,960
 And then don't forget, you're not just fed on milk.

247
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,680
 You get old enough to have solid food.

248
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,320
 So you have to be fed and learn how to eat.

249
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,040
 So among other things, we also need to be taught

250
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,760
 how to love.

251
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,400
 So my eldest son that you saw earlier,

252
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,960
 who's now 46.

253
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,920
 When he was little, when he was probably about,

254
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,560
 let me see, probably about nine,

255
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,400
 I used to sometimes at the end of the day,

256
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,840
 long day, I'd put my legs up on the sofa

257
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,800
 and I'd sort of curl up with my legs bent.

258
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,400
 Well, he'd clumber over me and he'd curl up in my legs

259
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,840
 and he'd come up to me and he'd want that cuddle

260
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,440
 and he'd want that nurturing.

261
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,800
 And that sort of like taught me

262
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,640
 how to love the human being in a deeper way.

263
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,880
 There's another story I wanna share with you.

264
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,960
 As you know, we're connected with the Vine Church

265
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,640
 here in Hong Kong.

266
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,040
 And the senior pastor we've known,

267
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,960
 grown up for years and he got married

268
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,880
 and he tried for family for many, many years.

269
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,080
 And unfortunately, they couldn't have their own children.

270
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,760
 So he went for adoption and roll it forward.

271
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,320
 He adopted a beautiful little girl called Mia,

272
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,600
 but she was 16 months when they adopted her.

273
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,880
 And she was in mother's choice.

274
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,520
 Don't know, many of you may know that's an orphanage

275
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,360
 for unmarried moms in the beginning,

276
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,200
 but it's come through that the babies

277
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,840
 would go out for adoption.

278
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,520
 And it's well known around now.

279
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,480
 Well, Andrew had this little girl and they named her Mia.

280
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,320
 And I can remember him telling the story

281
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,920
 of when he first met her, which was amazing

282
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,760
 and tear jerking, I won't go into that one.

283
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,640
 But the first, they brought her home

284
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,680
 and the first few months was so, so difficult

285
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,160
 because this little girl had been in an orphanage.

286
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,720
 She'd had love, but she didn't have a love

287
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,760
 of a mother or father.

288
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,400
 She had a love of a whole group of people

289
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,160
 that were around her looking after her.

290
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,800
 But when they had taken her home,

291
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,520
 having had that moment where you get the official adoption

292
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,640
 and whatever down there, she was at home

293
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,920
 and it still took months and they're looking at each other

294
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:06,360
 and they're going, we really expected her to come.

295
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,480
 Wow, mommy, daddy.

296
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,160
 And that didn't really happen.

297
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,480
 And it took a few months and one day,

298
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,080
 Andrew was looking at Christine, his wife in the kitchen

299
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,240
 and Mia was playing around her feet.

300
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,040
 And all of a sudden she grabbed mommy's leg

301
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,800
 and she held on for dear life.

302
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,840
 And that was her saying, I feel loved and accepted

303
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,160
 and you're now gonna be my new mom.

304
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,560
 Well, that little girl now has grown up.

305
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,240
 She's in high school and she is amazingly loved by them.

306
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,360
 And obviously the father's plan all along

307
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,080
 was for them to adopt that child.

308
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,120
 So she was a special, special gift.

309
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,160
 So from those stories,

310
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,960
 it shows that God is loving us unconditionally

311
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,600
 no matter who we are, where we're at.

312
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
 And I'm not just talking about mothers in this one

313
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,960
 or indeed females here.

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,960
 You know, you men have been given feminine nature as well

315
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,120
 as a masculine nature.

316
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
 This is nothing to do with sexuality,

317
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,200
 but father put within men and women a tender longing

318
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,280
 and a tender heart of himself.

319
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,280
 It's important to recognise that men have the ability

320
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,720
 within themselves to express tender longings

321
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,720
 that come from femininity of God.

322
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,320
 The nurturing love, as I said before,

323
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,720
 is love is a response to love.

324
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,720
 We learn how to, as a response to being loved,

325
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,320
 particularly a kind of love known as storge.

326
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,600
 I think it's on the screen.

327
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,880
 It's a Greek word and the Greek words meaning

328
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,320
 family affection and it conveys tenderness and care.

329
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,520
 It builds the foundation of life.

330
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,080
 And now we see in Psalm 113 verse nine,

331
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,000
 he, God, it gives the barren woman a home,

332
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,920
 making her the joyous mother of children.

333
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,200
 Praise the Lord.

334
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,240
 Storge can also be shown by the wider family

335
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,240
 through siblings, if you have them.

336
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,400
 I had cousins, grandparents who doted on me

337
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,800
 like I was super superhero to them

338
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,560
 and to the wider church and that is us.

339
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:46,560
 And it's for us to be rooted and grounded in love too.

340
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,960
 He intended that for us.

341
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,640
 I'd like to explore the feminine image a little bit more.

342
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,920
 Woman, I believe, were made for nurture, tenderness,

343
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,200
 but she was made for lots more too.

344
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,040
 We can do many more things than just all that.

345
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,040
 We're strong, we can do what the guys can do.

346
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,400
 So, and God knows that.

347
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,840
 He has amazing things where he challenges us to step out.

348
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,720
 And he put within us a feminine,

349
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,960
 something that we see when a baby really responds

350
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,560
 to a feminine softness.

351
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,640
 Typically, when a father holds a baby,

352
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,600
 he gives the feeling of strength in his arms

353
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,240
 as he holds that baby.

354
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,600
 But also as a mother, you can receive nurture

355
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,320
 that will build up, not destroy,

356
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,360
 rather it will build you up in life.

357
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,200
 Feminine love will establish you to live in holiness.

358
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,360
 You can have a secure, a source of intimacy and belonging.

359
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,720
 Going back to Genesis,

360
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,600
 the man named his wife Eve

361
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,960
 because she is the mother of everyone who lives

362
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,120
 in Genesis 3, 20.

363
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,520
 Then God created mankind in his likeness.

364
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,520
 He created male and he created female and blessed them

365
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,240
 and God made them in his image.

366
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,120
 Then came the fall.

367
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,560
 Adam and Eve sinned and were driven out of the garden.

368
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,640
 Life as intended was broken.

369
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,440
 Now, a fallen masculinity and a fallen femininity

370
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,040
 entered into them.

371
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,960
 There was brokenness and they were distorted.

372
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,840
 But I need to tell you, you were conceived in God's heart

373
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,200
 long before you were conceived naturally.

374
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,840
 And there are wonderful miracles of healing in our lives.

375
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,280
 Even after the fall,

376
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,800
 and there is an amazing way that a mother comforts a child.

377
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
 A father,

378
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,440
 yeah, a father

379
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,400
 often comforts in different ways.

380
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,640
 An example there would be the famous story

381
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,760
 of the little kid that's out in the garden playing

382
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,440
 or he's out on the beach or he's running around

383
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,240
 and all of a sudden, mom and dad hear this,

384
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,080
 (screams)

385
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,920
 there's screaming and everything's, you know,

386
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,320
 everything's fallen in his life and so they run out

387
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,440
 and the father's the first partner to be there.

388
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,320
 And he bends down to the child and he pats him on the back

389
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
 and he says, "There, there, there, you'll be fine.

390
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,840
 "You're fine.

391
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,320
 "You can go out and go back to play.

392
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,160
 "You'll be fine.

393
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,360
 "No worries, you're fine."

394
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,600
 But what does mom do?

395
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,000
 The mother does something completely different.

396
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,320
 The mother swoops down and she scoops up the child

397
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,680
 in her arms and she holds them and she soothes them.

398
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,440
 She comforts them.

399
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,200
 There should be a picture up here

400
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,440
 of the mother nurturing the baby.

401
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,000
 But if we were not rooted,

402
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 so the father loves you with a perfect love.

403
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,240
 If you are not rooted and established

404
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,200
 in this nurturing love, in the depths of holiness,

405
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,400
 we will always be searching for it.

406
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
 We will never be satisfied.

407
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,720
 We'll have a constant need for the father,

408
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,000
 not only expressed in the masculine,

409
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,840
 but expressed in the feminine.

410
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,560
 He not only loves you as a father,

411
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,680
 but he also loves you as a mother unconditionally.

412
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,840
 My prayer for you today,

413
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,280
 as that mother looks into that baby's eyes,

414
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,080
 is to receive unconditional love of the father

415
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,680
 with a mother heart and a father heart

416
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,600
 combined in one perfect love.

417
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,680
 I think as the band come up,

418
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,960
 I just would like to pray for you

419
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,680
 and pray for you to be able to be a mother

420
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,400
 and to pray for you.

421
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,520
 And I've had lots of thoughts during the day

422
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,520
 and I just want us to quieten our hearts down.

423
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:26,840
 And I just wanna invite the Holy Spirit just to come

424
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:33,640
 and just come into the room and come to us.

425
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,360
 If you're willing to receive what the father has for you,

426
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,800
 it's just, if you wanna place your hands out

427
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,640
 just in the air, it's like receiving a gift from the father

428
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,400
 through his Holy Spirit to you.

429
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,280
 Father, I just pray, Holy Spirit, come.

430
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,320
 I pray, Father, that we give permission for you

431
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,800
 just to touch our hearts and reveal your supernatural,

432
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,600
 unconditional love for each one in this room.

433
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,920
 That love that is always with us.

434
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,760
 It's a love that will always be with us.

435
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,440
 If we know you, you'll be with us.

436
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,120
 It's a love that will always be there

437
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,320
 to push us through the times of down times

438
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,040
 to high times to those in between.

439
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,080
 And he will show himself to you

440
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,720
 in an amazing way this weekend.

441
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,280
 As we celebrate the mothers that you've given to us,

442
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,240
 and the children that you've given those mums,

443
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,680
 and Father, I just pray, Father,

444
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,360
 this will be a special blessing.

445
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,120
 As we said, that little flower gift that we have,

446
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,440
 if we pray over that as we give it to our mums,

447
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,880
 that it will make such an amazing blessing on them

448
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,920
 through your Holy Spirit in them.

449
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,560
 And you know what?

450
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,800
 We only have to ask for your love.

451
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,320
 And Father, I ask for your love to fill us now.

452
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,840
 I pray that it will be so overwhelming

453
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,240
 that it will come into our hearts in an amazing way

454
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,520
 that we cannot explain it in the humanist.

455
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
 But you'll come into our hearts in a way

456
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,400
 that we know that you're real and that you're here with us.

457
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,080
 So Father, I pray that you just pour your spirit

458
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,160
 into every son and daughter in this room.

459
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,960
 And those that are watching online

460
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,560
 and those that are tuning in later,

461
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,200
 just, I just pray, Father,

462
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,760
 that you just show yourself in a new way

463
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,240
 with that unconditional love

464
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,200
 that you so desperately wanna give to your children.

465
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,200
 To know that you're our mum and our dad

466
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,560
 and one that will never, ever let us down.

467
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,920
 So Father, I thank you.

468
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,720
 You've been in this peace in this room.

469
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,160
 And I pray, Father, that you will bless and protect

470
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,360
 everyone in this room as we go from here.

471
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,200
 In Jesus' name, amen.

472
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,280
 (laughs)
