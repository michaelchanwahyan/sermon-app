[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.600]   I'm so happy to be here today.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.680]   This is KFC, right?
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.480]   Yes, and there are many young people here.
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.400]   Let me introduce myself first.
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.880]   I'm Hu Yu-yong, the founder of U4.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.840]   Young people usually don't call themselves "Yong-ge".
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.840]   But if you're 25 or older,
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.360]   you can call yourself "Yong".
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.600]   We're all the same age.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.440]   So I want to hear...
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.640]   Because I can't see your faces clearly under the light.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.000]   I want to know who is "Yong" and who is "Yong-ge".
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.160]   I want to know where you are.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.720]   I'll count to three, and you can call my name.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.720]   I'll know where you are.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.560]   One, two, three.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.440]   This side is "Yong-ge".
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.440]   I often go to different schools,
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.000]   different churches,
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.240]   and different jobs.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.880]   We have a space in our workplace.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.680]   We have a space here.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.640]   Last time, a team of witnesses came to visit us.
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.880]   It just so happens to be called "The World".
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.000]   So when I saw "Come to The World",
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.200]   I felt very familiar.
[00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.240]   It's like welcoming me.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.280]   I can continue to bring the water of life to the world.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.360]   Here, everyone can meet Jesus.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.680]   It's like a paradise.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.200]   Today's topic is called "The New Fire".
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.480]   My original topic was a bit of a joke.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.560]   The "New" in "New Fire" is what we originally called "New Fire Youth Network".
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.680]   People usually call it "U4".
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.720]   U4 has a special feature, which is "fast".
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.880]   So I talk very fast.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.840]   Can you keep up with me?
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.640]   I want to cooperate with everyone.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.080]   I don't need to be so sincere.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.120]   So I'm very sincere.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.320]   I speed up my speech.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.440]   And I have limited time.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.040]   I'll talk faster.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.680]   U4 has two core values.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.440]   First, we want to talk about networks.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.480]   Through different bridges,
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.880]   we can connect to many different schools,
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.640]   churches,
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.080]   and workplaces,
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.240]   and different institutions.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.400]   It's like a four-wheel drive.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.120]   It's fast.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.920]   It's fast on the highway.
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.600]   And we also talk about generation.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.800]   Generation is the generation of the New Fire.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.200]   So the "New" in "New Fire Youth Network"
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.640]   is a bit of a joke.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.520]   It's the wood under the three fires.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.240]   Many people expect the youth to be useless.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.000]   But when the fire is lit in the church,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.720]   it's like Moses.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.280]   Even if he has a lot of sadness,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.520]   when the fire is lit,
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.120]   he will find his fire, his life, and his life again in the church.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.960]   He has a destiny.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.960]   So we hope that the youth can be like this fire.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.840]   The logo of the fire is like the fire of the Holy Spirit.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.760]   It's lit.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.280]   And then you think of the four fires.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.720]   Because the New Fire is also a big fire.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.360]   One big fire and three small fires.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.880]   It's like Daniel and his three friends.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.280]   In the Babylonian system,
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.680]   they are still standing for God.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.600]   When they were young,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.480]   when they were studying,
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.920]   they were still standing for God.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.760]   They died, but they still have confidence.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.720]   They are not afraid to go into the fire.
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.920]   We hope that our youth will continue to burn the love of God.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.280]   This is our goal.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.040]   So we have to cross generations, cross regions,
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.680]   cross schools, cross borders to go together.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.440]   It's been 25 years.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.200]   There were a lot of celebrations yesterday.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.640]   I will continue to watch.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.920]   It's better to watch the video.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.800]   Let's watch a short video.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.600]   Music, please.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.400]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:04:04.800]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.320]   Okay, we've watched the video for only one minute.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.840]   I don't know how you feel after watching it.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.320]   I want you to interview me later.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.680]   I don't want to be on the stage.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.040]   I will walk down the stage later.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.240]   I will interview you.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.440]   After watching the video,
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.480]   what did you see?
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.920]   What are the characteristics?
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.960]   Do you have any DNA?
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.720]   I will give you about 15 seconds
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.280]   to talk to the people next to you.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.280]   I will see who didn't say anything.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.240]   I will find those people.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.080]   Okay, 15 seconds.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.040]   Start talking.
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.920]   What did you see in this video?
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.560]   What atmosphere?
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.400]   How do you feel?
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.360]   Okay.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.440]   I will give you a little time to talk.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.800]   I will give you a little interaction time.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.480]   Okay.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.120]   Five seconds left.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.240]   Five, four, three, two, one.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.400]   Okay, time's up.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.160]   Okay, I see a couple.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.560]   Yes, they are holding hands to talk.
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.320]   I think they are close.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.040]   Okay, let's interview the previous generation.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.120]   We are a cross-generation, right?
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.120]   Okay, what do you think?
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.720]   We think it's very energetic.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.360]   Very energetic?
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.520]   Yes.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.080]   What about you?
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.480]   I want to ask you if you think the video is fast.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.800]   Okay, because it's energetic.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.240]   Wow, give him a big round of applause.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.280]   Let's interview you.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.320]   How do you feel about the video?
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.560]   Very fast.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.440]   Yes.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.880]   I can hear it.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.680]   I can hear it.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.560]   I can hear it.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.640]   What about you?
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.840]   Same.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.960]   You are all wearing the same clothes.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.400]   Keep watching his hoodie.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.120]   You know, when I go to many places to broadcast,
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.120]   especially the previous generation,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.600]   they say, "Why are you so fast? We can't catch up."
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.280]   When I first saw this video,
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.760]   I asked my colleagues in the media department
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.680]   if they should slow down.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.760]   They said, "Brother Yong, you are fast."
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   "You are fast."
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.560]   "If you don't speed up, people will be confused."
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.720]   "It's the same."
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.920]   So, it's not about what you see,
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.040]   but what you feel.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.720]   This is an era of sensibility.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.560]   So, they feel energetic,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.920]   and there are many things to interact with.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.240]   It's like they want to participate.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.360]   This is the atmosphere.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.280]   People will stop watching after a minute.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.680]   You can think of it as an ad.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.560]   It's good.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.840]   So, the previous generation
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.400]   would slow down
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.760]   and the next generation would think,
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.800]   "No, you can't catch up."
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.960]   So, the speed of the two generations is different.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.120]   Our expressions are different.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.520]   We have many adjustments.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.080]   So, I'm willing to go with the young.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   So, you go out.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.040]   We'll go in the middle.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.080]   Why is this?
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.040]   It's not this.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.000]   Why is this?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.320]   Okay.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.200]   It's an ad for the video.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.880]   Sorry.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:28.160]   Okay.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.960]   Let's keep watching.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.960]   Today, I want to talk about
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.160]   "The Legend of the Three-Line Poetry."
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.240]   Let's read this sentence together.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.240]   One, two, three.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.760]   "The day of the great and great is yet to come.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.480]   I will not be able to see the day before.
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.880]   Where are you going?
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.520]   The heart of a father must turn to his daughter,
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.520]   and the heart of a daughter to her father,
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.520]   lest I should come and help the land."
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.240]   This is Malachi 4, 5-6.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.320]   It's also the last verse
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   in the Old Testament.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.960]   This is a very important message
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.480]   in the Bible.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.480]   Since we need to talk about the meaning behind the message,
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.760]   we need to talk about the background of the Malachi 4.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.120]   It's a big era.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.360]   There are many internal and external troubles.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.760]   In the middle,
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.800]   the people who were exiled and then returned
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.360]   started to rebuild the temple.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.680]   There were many internal moral problems.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.120]   They started to fail.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.920]   There were many religious problems in the society.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.320]   Everyone couldn't stand it.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.040]   But there were many complaints.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.600]   The Jews experienced external difficulties.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.000]   The pressure from the outside world and the economic situation
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.200]   caused many disturbances.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.080]   So they thought, "Why would God make me come here?
[00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.720]   Why would God make me come here
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.800]   when I was watching the injustice?
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.880]   Many people used their self-centeredness to talk to God.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.120]   In the political world,
[00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.080]   in the Persian dynasty,
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.160]   in the ruling environment,
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.400]   everyone was unstable.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.080]   The policy changed at any time.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.240]   It's like in this era,
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.240]   the international situation is suddenly...
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.720]   In the international affairs,
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.880]   the country must attack the people.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.360]   Even if it's not just a fire,
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.960]   there are many economic conflicts.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.880]   In the era of AI,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.160]   everyone is very nervous.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.520]   We are living in a big era.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.200]   In the middle,
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.960]   you can see the importance of God.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.040]   When facing many questions,
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.840]   He chooses to be patient
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.240]   and constantly talk to His people.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.640]   He constantly tries to solve the problems
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.680]   and solve the knots in their hearts.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.720]   At the same time, He gives some instructions
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.480]   and even teaches them.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.920]   We can see the need for spiritual restoration.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   We need to return to the temple.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.480]   So in the Bible,
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.520]   we need to turn our father's heart
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   into our daughter's heart
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.280]   and our daughter's heart into our father's heart.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.560]   There are two meanings.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.280]   Father means God.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.120]   We need to return to God.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.280]   As God's daughter,
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.160]   God's children,
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.680]   we need to return to God's original law.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.080]   He said it earlier.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.480]   In the Bible,
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   "When you abandon me,
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.960]   when you leave the teaching,
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.440]   you will be saved."
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.600]   That's the meaning.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.840]   And there is a second meaning.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:58.120]   We need to choose to be with our parents.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.360]   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.200]   were the herdsmen in the middle.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.440]   David was the herdsman
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.320]   when he was built in the middle of the kingdom.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.040]   We need to be with our parents.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.040]   We need to return to God.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.640]   How did they follow God?
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.440]   That's the root.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.920]   We need to return to God.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.000]   So that we won't be in the middle of the crowd.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.840]   So this is a call to the heart.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.760]   And then,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.800]   there is the old covenant.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.920]   It's also the situation of the new covenant.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.600]   There is a man named John the Baptist.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.680]   He was described as Elijah.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.480]   And in the Old Covenant,
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.800]   he was following Jesus.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.160]   Jesus didn't say anything for 400-500 years.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.360]   He didn't speak the word of God.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.840]   He was very dry inside.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.480]   So he wanted to see if there was any inspiration.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.960]   If there was anyone who could lead us
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.000]   to leave the wilderness.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.800]   And who was Elijah in the wilderness?
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.480]   Many times,
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.600]   the Old Covenant describes him like this.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.760]   He must have the heart and ability of Elijah.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.160]   He was walking in front of the Lord.
[00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.720]   He called for the heart to turn to the ears.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.480]   He called for the people to turn to the ears.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.160]   And he called for the people to be ready to be with him.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.400]   To be ready for Jesus to come again.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.760]   To come to the middle of us.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.800]   So this is also our call now.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   We need to use a king of kings,
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.480]   a king of kings,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.120]   a king of kings,
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.120]   in every chapter.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.920]   We need to be ready for this path.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.000]   We are all called to be the voice of the wilderness.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.280]   Whether it's the New Testament,
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.360]   or the New Testament,
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.560]   or the New Testament,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:36.040]   we are all called to be the voice of the wilderness.
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.160]   God is also very wonderful in the middle.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.560]   He is the one who puts Elijah and the Lord together.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.520]   God's words and Elijah's work are like Elijah's work.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.560]   The clothes he wears are similar to Elijah's.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.400]   So when people see a crazy man talking,
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.120]   it's like they know each other.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.480]   It's like there are people like this in the middle.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.440]   So they are called to the wilderness very quickly.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.280]   There was no WhatsApp or Instagram.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.080]   Why did people go to the wilderness so quickly?
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:04.000]   Because some people look familiar.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.200]   Is it him?
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.680]   So everyone is in the wilderness,
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.640]   in the wilderness,
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.720]   people are everywhere.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.640]   And then line up in the church
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.000]   to be baptized by him.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.080]   This is the background of the time.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.480]   Everyone is learning.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.720]   Everyone is not in the middle.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.200]   There is already a place in the middle.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.160]   There is no hope.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.000]   So we have found that in the past few years,
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.320]   Hong Kong has not been able to dream.
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.840]   We need God to lead us,
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.720]   help us,
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.360]   and know how to leave the seat of the devil.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.040]   But it's clear that
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.200]   if the heart of the Father and the heart of Elijah are not aligned,
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.480]   we will not be able to align the heart of God,
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:40.520]   and we will not be able to go back to the people of the past,
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.920]   the people of different generations,
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.280]   even when we established this church,
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.720]   our predecessors,
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   our previous generation,
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.800]   it is very difficult for us to be aligned in the middle,
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.200]   and continue to survive the industries that our previous generation gave us.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.560]   And the Hong Kong Church,
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.840]   facing the impact of these ten years and eight years,
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.320]   we have to face the reality that the faith generation has left a lot.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.760]   From the age of ten to thirty,
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.880]   we rarely see this picture.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.560]   I often go to different churches,
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.000]   do you know that more than half of the churches
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.040]   only have ten or eight members?
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.200]   Some of the believers,
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.360]   about one-fourth,
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.640]   have to start over,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.000]   start over from elementary school,
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.840]   from the faith generation.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.880]   The group of more than 100 people is very large.
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.200]   You are a large youth church.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.560]   Many churches are very square,
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.040]   the believers are left behind by faith,
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.080]   and by the wood,
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.360]   even the leaders and the leaders of the wood-raising youth have left.
[00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.720]   Many of my friends have left,
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.320]   because they have been walking in the江湖 for so long,
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.840]   and have met many different youth pastors.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.720]   They have no choice,
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.080]   because their children are very young,
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.800]   so they have the opportunity to think about what to do next.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.480]   And you see the immigration era,
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.320]   the unemployment era,
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.480]   the political situation is unstable,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.320]   the pandemic has a lot of impact.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.880]   We have started to disconnect,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.320]   and there is a big gap between people.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.560]   I don't know if you have communicated,
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.720]   it has been a few years,
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.600]   people are beginning to feel that communication is an obstacle,
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.440]   there is a social fear,
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.800]   many times they wear masks and are afraid to see people.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.520]   This is the state we have to face in this era,
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.720]   this state of challenge.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.600]   And what will happen to Hong Kong?
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.680]   Many young people,
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.960]   even those with a degree,
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.160]   have chosen to jump into the church.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.680]   Last week, I had a chat with a principal,
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.080]   he said the school was under a lot of pressure,
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.120]   and was very nervous.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.320]   Suddenly, a person disappeared in the classroom,
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.600]   and everyone was looking for him,
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.440]   and they were all fighting,
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.280]   but they couldn't find him.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.760]   Who knew he went to the toilet to poop?
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:30.280]   The disappearance of the principal for 10 minutes,
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.800]   shocked the whole school.
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.880]   But what was the feeling?
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.920]   Very alert,
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.120]   very sensitive.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.440]   Some teachers in the school are very stressed,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.520]   recently, a girl was cutting her hand in the classroom,
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.160]   and she had to deal with the blood.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.640]   She went home every day,
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.400]   and she repeated this scene when she was sleeping.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.080]   She was the only one who was helpless.
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.720]   I want to say,
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.120]   it's not just the students who are stressed,
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.160]   but also the teachers.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.720]   Many of them jumped up,
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.960]   and wanted to pull her closer.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.680]   Those in the first year of the class,
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.840]   they were under a lot of pressure,
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.600]   and there were a lot of comparisons.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.800]   Even if I was in the top 10,
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.240]   I felt very unsatisfied,
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.240]   and I was not good enough.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.200]   But in the second and third year,
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.360]   there were a lot of SENs,
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.000]   and a lot of families broke up.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.680]   We found that the whole school,
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.360]   the next generation,
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.400]   was facing a big impact.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.880]   I don't know if you feel the same way.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.080]   A lot of comparisons,
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.200]   a lot of differences,
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.120]   a lot of competition,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.240]   which made us feel lost.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.400]   How do we solve this problem?
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.320]   We see that
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.760]   everyone has different opinions.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.400]   So when there are a lot of disputes,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.560]   we are disconnected.
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.600]   And death is a total disconnect.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.480]   So I don't know if you feel a lot of pressure.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.520]   We have a lot of contradictions in our generation.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.200]   One of them is the point of view.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.840]   A lot of opinions are different,
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.280]   a lot of opinions are mixed.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:44.240]   It depends on the situation.
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.160]   It depends on how we look at the situation.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.240]   Whether we support Islam or not,
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.200]   we have a long time to argue.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.240]   So we often
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.960]   stand in such contradictions.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.560]   One day, the Buddha asked me to look at this picture.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.200]   He said, "Do you know what number this is?"
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:55.960]   "What is it?"
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.280]   "Well, it's a little bigger here."
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.680]   "This is nine. I'm nine.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.480]   I eat more salt than you eat rice."
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.720]   "No, I'm six."
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.360]   "I see this,
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.000]   I have a different view."
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.280]   Everyone wants everyone to stand opposite each other.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.760]   And then the following is the conclusion.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.880]   Why are people arguing?
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.720]   Because they don't stand in the opposite direction.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.800]   Then, do you know?
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.720]   The Buddha told me,
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.200]   "Actually, most people look at it this way."
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.760]   "Do you know how to look at it from the perspective of the ascetic?"
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.840]   "What do you mean?"
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.400]   Sometimes, when I talk to the upper level,
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.840]   I have to think about it and reflect on it.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.800]   When I went to the inner room to pray again,
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.640]   the Buddha said, "This is not a number."
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.160]   "It's not nine and six."
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.800]   "What is this word?"
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.520]   "On the side of nine,
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.120]   it's the G of small grass."
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.800]   "On the side of six, it's the G of large grass."
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.120]   "In fact, everyone is G."
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.240]   "Do you know that?"
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.760]   "Many times, we are G."
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:46.040]   So we have to look at it from the perspective of God.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:46.880]   Thank you.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.400]   Give me some applause.
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.320]   It's hard to get applause.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.160]   Do you understand?
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.560]   I think they are very self-righteous.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.440]   "Do you know that G is for God?"
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.040]   "G is for good."
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.720]   "Can we look at it from the perspective of God?"
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.000]   "Is it good to look at it from the perspective of the tree of life?"
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.720]   "Is it good to look at it from the perspective of God?"
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.160]   "Can we look at it from the perspective of Jesus?"
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.120]   "Where is Jesus?"
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:06.960]   "Jesus is next to you."
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.160]   "What do you do?"
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.200]   "We pray."
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.600]   "We can be one."
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.200]   His sacrifice is to take away the toxic root of the fruit of division and division of love.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.600]   To restore our status of "sons and daughters."
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.800]   We each look at each other and give love to each other.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:21.880]   So that people can recognize us as their disciples.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.000]   So that we can give love to each other in our lives.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.160]   To prevent many sins.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.320]   Not to ignore the sins.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.880]   It's that we cover each other in the middle.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.000]   Even to accept.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.680]   Then let him have a chance to return.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.000]   Return to the heart of God.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.760]   The church should be like this.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.600]   So that there is a distinction.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.000]   When the heart of God is cold.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.320]   Matthew 24 says so.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.280]   But there are people who distinguish between right and wrong.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.760]   It should be like this.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.280]   The church is not in the middle.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.920]   Just you stab me, I stab you.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:47.800]   Stabbing each other in the nose.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   It's not like that.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.160]   It's to look at each other.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.000]   So can we look at each other in both generations?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Now it's starting.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.240]   Many times, the tree of life is divided.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.320]   It's you and me.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.440]   I also told my parents.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.240]   "You don't have a gift."
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.480]   "Don't peek at my things on Instagram."
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.480]   Many times, we don't want to look at each other.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.000]   We don't want to see each other.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.560]   We don't want to be seen by each other.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.560]   If so,
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.560]   what is the situation of the righteous and the evil?
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.760]   When we want to share,
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.360]   when some people are looking at each other,
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:16.200]   we have lost the blessing and the cover of our previous generation.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.440]   We see that in the Bible,
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.120]   the spirit of God is called the blood of the Father.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.520]   I won't talk about this for a long time.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.280]   But what I want to say is that
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.560]   you have to know that the spirit of God is a high-speed development in the Bible.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.080]   Because everyone is AI.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.440]   Everyone has a lot of knowledge.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.320]   But there is no wisdom.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.720]   And no experience in life.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.840]   So it's too late to wait for him to drink the blood of the Father.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.240]   You will have a spiritual leader when you have a little peace.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.120]   Now your children need to speak.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.840]   Your teenagers need to see the vision.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.160]   Your seniors,
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.120]   in English, it means your seniors need to have a dream.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.000]   This is the third generation.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.120]   The younger children can be teenagers.
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.280]   Teenagers will let go of their vision.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.280]   It's hard for seniors to keep having dreams.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.720]   Seniors just wait to die.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.640]   Many times it's like this.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.080]   So can we put the three or four generations together?
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.320]   And what is the key?
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.360]   You call it mentors, right?
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.920]   It's you.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.400]   We start at the age of twenty or thirty,
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.000]   and go to the age of fifty or sixty.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.440]   This is your generation.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.360]   Can you put so many people together?
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.960]   This is a family.
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.120]   At the end of the day,
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.160]   the hardest thing to do is our family.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.280]   If our family is not well managed,
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.600]   if there is no good ecology,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.520]   many times our children will be left behind.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.960]   We can't let God's love and God's law
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.560]   lead them to the end, and they won't be deviated.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.960]   So the enemy wants to destroy the family of the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.160]   In the touch of the Holy Spirit,
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.800]   we can recognize that Jesus Christ is the Lord.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.360]   In this scripture, it says
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.280]   we must keep the new life and the old life together,
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.080]   so that we can have the ability to resist,
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.480]   and the ability to expand God's kingdom.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.920]   Then we can have more ability to fill the whole land.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.920]   So we can be steady in the world.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.440]   We see a lot of teenagers who have a lot of objections.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.280]   And here is an example.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.640]   This is my teenager.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.360]   I want to show you the changes in his church.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.360]   Let's welcome his pastor.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.680]   We know that in the Bible,
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.680]   our parents' hearts are turned to our children.
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.040]   Our children's hearts are turned to our parents,
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.680]   so that God can help us.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.840]   You see, in Hong Kong,
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.120]   there are many conflicts and conflicts in the cross-generation.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.160]   It's like a rupture.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.120]   So it makes us, in this city,
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.680]   full of many obstacles.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.200]   So how can we turn the crisis into a turning point?
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.280]   Next to me is my teenager,
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.040]   his name is Zhu Yin.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.480]   He wants to share with you
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.360]   how we can cross-generate the cross-generation
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.360]   and sell the things that God gives us.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   Zhu Yin, please.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:39.560]   Okay, I want to share with you
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.840]   how I get along with my pastor.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.520]   Actually, we first met five years ago.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.160]   He came to our church.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.520]   He just finished his theology.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.880]   Before he studied theology, he was a teacher.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.480]   So we young people don't like him very much.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.320]   Because he has a teacher's personality.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.680]   He has a long temper,
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.360]   a low-key and very strict personality.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.320]   So we think that this pastor doesn't really care about us.
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.040]   He just wants to control us more.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.560]   So we didn't like him very much at that time.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.920]   But you guys seem to have been playing together since childhood.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.400]   Yes, we started to get to know each other since we were in middle school.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   And then we grew up together.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.440]   Actually, the church made us into eight young people.
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.560]   So the pastor and pastor also care about us a lot.
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.440]   He also helped you, right?
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.720]   Yes.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.360]   So we thought that our pastor was a bit more strict.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.080]   Why did he change?
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.600]   Actually, I have a very good relationship with him now.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.160]   Why is there such a difference?
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.040]   I remember one year, I was invited by our pastor
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.880]   to join a camp called Holiness.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.880]   It's a group of young people who want to be holy for God.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.520]   But they can't get into the camp.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.960]   Actually, I remember that time.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.240]   The pastor told me a word.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:01.640]   He said that the pastor who is now serving me is his own.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:06.440]   If I don't believe in the person I can see and follow,
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.000]   how can I believe in the God I can't see?
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.040]   He is not very honest.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.800]   It's like Yong Bo is sitting next to me now.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.360]   I can see him, I can touch him.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.240]   So this is a big reminder.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.240]   Then I decided to reconcile my relationship with my pastor.
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.200]   I was very brave at that time.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.240]   Not only me, but also my whole group had to reconcile with my pastor.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.120]   I invited the ten or eight people who grew up with me
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.000]   to surround my pastor and say sorry to him.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.160]   Wow, what did you do after saying sorry?
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:44.440]   Then I tried to convince him and try to be with him.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.480]   The first thing I did with him was to serve him in school.
[00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.120]   Wow, that's amazing.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.320]   Becoming his right-hand man.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.440]   When he entered the school,
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.480]   he looked at a group of younger students.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.640]   He thought, "Wow, these students are so much like themselves."
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.720]   They would still be stubborn, late, and not give in.
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.080]   That made me understand the heart of my pastor more.
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.040]   He treated us like that at that time.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.680]   He was also tolerant and believed that we could grow up
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.280]   and we could make a big progress.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.280]   My pastor continued to love us.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.560]   He continued to tolerate us in our congregation.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   That made me understand his heart more.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.840]   My pastor also made me understand the heart of a father and a mother.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.600]   When the two of you reconciled and turned to your pastor,
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.960]   we saw that you had already entered the school.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.080]   You could lead the students,
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.800]   and you led the students with the pastor.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.760]   How many people are there in your church from the eight to now?
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.320]   There are 40 to 50 people who are now in the church.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   40 to 50 people! That's a big growth!
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.320]   It's not easy to see such a growth in this period of time.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.440]   It must be a blessing from God.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.560]   And the students who are in the school
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.520]   should be about 100 people.
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.320]   So when they went to serve with the pastors,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.960]   there were already more than 10 college students who were in the same group.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.080]   So we really want to see the intergenerational connection
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.320]   and the restoration.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.160]   Blessings to the church and to our city.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.600]   Blessings to everyone!
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.560]   Okay, so, Ju-Yen has already become a pastor.
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:20.080]   She has already been nursing more than 30 teenagers
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.720]   in her own small group.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.200]   You can see that when we went up there,
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.800]   we took her away from the security area.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.920]   This is a military camp.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.120]   But the real battlefield is actually
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.200]   a place where people are killed in a row.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.560]   We saw that the school was a heavy area.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.120]   Many times, it was getting more and more crowded.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.680]   People were very cold.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.800]   Everyone was under great pressure.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.920]   And when these young people were in the church,
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.840]   they were very comfortable.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.360]   But when they went to school with us,
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.760]   and we did this prayer-learning program,
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.720]   we let them know how to turn the tide.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.840]   In the past 11 years,
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.080]   we have brought a lot of college students,
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.320]   500 college students from different churches,
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.840]   to these schools,
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.920]   and we did a one-on-four training.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.080]   We did it twice a week,
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.800]   and there was a tuition fee.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.320]   And then they took their shirts in the middle,
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.400]   and then went to serve.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.080]   Most importantly,
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.080]   the prayers were very sincere.
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.920]   Every day, every time they went in,
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.160]   it affected them.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.440]   I remember that there was a group of people
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:19.840]   who went to a Buddhist school.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.880]   All of us who went to school
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.960]   had no religious background.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.440]   There were six boys.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.480]   He said that a lot of servicemen
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.080]   were taken by the girls in the church.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.640]   So they really wanted to do something.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.960]   They really wanted the church to be a good place.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.440]   So they knew that this plan was recommended by everyone,
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.600]   so they came.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.360]   After they came,
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.960]   they went in with me on the first day.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.200]   And then we walked around the school,
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.080]   and before we went into the classroom,
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.080]   we passed the main hall.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.080]   In the main hall,
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   there was a Buddha altar.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.360]   The whole hall was this tall.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.200]   He said that he had never seen a Buddha altar in a school.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.240]   "Hey, Yong-ge, there's a long light."
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.000]   "I found a wood-burning room."
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.160]   They called it the "host room."
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.360]   "You didn't know?"
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.600]   That's how the Buddhist school was.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.800]   The priest tried to shave his head for seven days.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:00.720]   The priest went to Changzhou.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.800]   You went to Canberra.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.560]   He said that there was a Buddha festival in the middle.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.920]   So don't not know.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.360]   There are a lot of situations like this.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.240]   So they said, "Can we go earlier?"
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.280]   "Let's go to the altar 15 minutes earlier."
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.280]   And then they prayed.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.680]   Because I felt that
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.600]   these people had never heard the Buddha's voice.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.120]   It was very difficult.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.680]   Many times, when we bring university students
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.760]   from the military camp to the battlefield,
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.520]   their eyes open.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:26.280]   Although they may be a little bit of a bully,
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.840]   but when they face the three of them,
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.520]   they can't do anything.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.880]   Now there are a lot of obvious symptoms.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.480]   And usually those who can't keep up with the progress of learning
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.160]   are the basic students.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.200]   No money, no resources.
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.960]   They are like a base,
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.920]   a base,
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.080]   being trampled on.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.880]   The teachers at school can't take care of them.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:47.720]   And then they are abandoned in the middle.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.200]   And then there is a vicious cycle.
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.600]   Confidence,
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.080]   interpersonal relationships,
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.240]   often go down.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.880]   There are really a lot of emotional situations.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.400]   When these people are in the military camp,
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.520]   when they go to the battlefield,
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.240]   they are calm.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.560]   Because when it comes to actual situations,
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.640]   when they respond,
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.880]   we don't have any equipment.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.280]   So when you are in this cold room,
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.360]   when you try to fight with us,
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:16.800]   you know what you are up to.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.320]   Do you have a familiar military uniform?
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.840]   Do you know how to face the situation in the Senior Campus?
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:24.560]   Almost half of our contact is in the Senior Campus.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:27.520]   And a lot of Band 3D is one third.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.440]   How do we train them?
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.920]   How do we teach them how to learn and motivate?
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.800]   We are not just training to make them feel better.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.240]   We really want to see them make a new breakthrough.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.120]   We see that in the past,
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.280]   this plan has attracted a lot of parents,
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.120]   teachers,
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:42.840]   college students,
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.080]   and also a lot of middle school students.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.600]   Their witnesses are evaluated highly.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:52.160]   The teachers in the Buddhist schools have been with me for 10 years.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.200]   Although they know I have a background in Christianity,
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.240]   I still go.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.920]   In the Taoist schools, we go.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.040]   In the Catholic schools, we go.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:58.840]   In the Catholic schools, we go.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.640]   In short, we go in without permission.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.960]   There is a school that gives us from 30 to 100 people.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.280]   Because there is a great need for harmony.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.520]   We see that in the darkness,
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.040]   we are the only ones who have the light
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.680]   and the power to make a difference.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.400]   Do we have our identity?
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.040]   Do we know that we are chosen to be a priest,
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:16.960]   a military instructor,
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.840]   a saint,
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.200]   and a holy finger?
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.520]   So after we have regained our identity,
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.880]   we try to go to the darkest areas.
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.560]   It is too easy to worship and praise here.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.000]   Try it.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Go to a hall
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.160]   and worship and praise together.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.160]   The people below will be very confused.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.880]   Can you still be able to praise?
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.480]   I am very grateful to my team.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.800]   I even preach to them now.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.760]   Try it.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.120]   Follow your passion.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.080]   Share it.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.880]   I think Benson is the God of Band.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.000]   That's why he is called Benson.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.400]   He plays everything by himself.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.280]   He also writes songs.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.000]   You can try to listen to their songs.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.360]   Today, he deliberately does not bring his own songs.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.720]   Because today he is not promoting himself.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.400]   He wants everyone to see that he is God.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.680]   So today, I want to say to him,
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.320]   "Finally, we only have 5 minutes left.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.320]   Go for it."
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.720]   1, 2, 3.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   I can hear you.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.200]   Yes.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.800]   I really want to share with you
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.080]   what I have witnessed
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.440]   especially in U of R.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.400]   Actually, everyone is very young.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.880]   I have also experienced
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.280]   being so young like everyone else.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.480]   But I found that
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.680]   when I was...
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:31.520]   How did I experience my middle school?
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.680]   I had a lot of things I wanted to do
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.520]   or a lot of thoughts.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.560]   Is there anyone who...
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.800]   There are always...
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:38.840]   What is it called?
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.480]   Besides having a lot of thoughts,
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.920]   there are also times when you feel emo.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.960]   Is there anyone like that?
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.240]   If so, can you raise your hand?
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.480]   Oh, maybe you don't dare to raise your hand.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.320]   I want to say that
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.480]   in a middle school environment,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.560]   I had a lot of emotions
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.480]   and different thoughts.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.920]   But I want to say that
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.520]   God's design for me is very special.
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.640]   He made me like music very much.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.160]   I also like to play.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.000]   So when I came to U of R,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.680]   God...
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.360]   I mean, Yong Ge, he challenged me.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.520]   "Benson, have you ever thought about
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.280]   what this generation needs?"
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.280]   Maybe what everyone needs
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.880]   is not just what we usually need
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.440]   in school.
[00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.560]   It's actually about
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.320]   how we can take one more step forward.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.800]   God really made us do something.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.080]   What did God make me do?
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.720]   It's worship.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.520]   So when I'm here,
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.360]   I really want to...
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.920]   I really want to show people
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.720]   that worship is very important.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.160]   Everyone here is a Christian.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.520]   Worship is very important.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.560]   Worship is a moment
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.400]   where you can communicate with God sincerely.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.960]   It's not just about singing.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.600]   So I went to a school
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:58.640]   and developed a worship course with Yong Ge.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.440]   And I wanted to create a band
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.240]   with a group of people.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.720]   We wanted to share our original songs
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.600]   and messages.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.560]   It's like a little stone
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.440]   thrown into a pool of water.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.600]   It creates a chain.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.360]   When you turn it,
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.080]   it will spread fire.
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.960]   Life affects life.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.120]   But I found out that it wasn't enough.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.280]   What was not enough?
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.520]   It turned out that 80% of young people
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.600]   are still going to school.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.160]   So what should we do?
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.720]   We went straight to the school.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.000]   What should we do?
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.280]   One day, when I thought about it,
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.600]   I found out that God was telling me
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.880]   that everyone has been very tired and painful
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.200]   in the past few years.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.240]   Because the worst thing is that
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.800]   it's painful but you can't say it.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.600]   Yong Ge said,
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.120]   "Why don't we make a musical drama
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.320]   called 'Pain Is Not New'?"
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:55.280]   I believe everyone likes to watch shows.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.960]   If you go to Kitee Academy,
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.360]   I heard there is a co-play.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.280]   I don't know if anyone has tickets.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:05.760]   But if we can bring the show to school,
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.880]   will it make it easier for everyone to understand
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:09.760]   what Jesus Christ is like?
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.760]   Especially when we talk about pain,
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.560]   when we can't talk about it,
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.120]   what I want to say is that
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.440]   do you think Jesus Christ has never been in pain?
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.800]   Do you think he doesn't understand you?
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.240]   He experienced it like this
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.840]   more than 2,000 years ago.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.400]   But he is the God of resurrection.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.840]   So today we can rely on him
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.120]   to experience this resurrection,
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.560]   to be healed again,
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.840]   to regain that life,
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.440]   to be rejuvenated.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.120]   So we built this musical drama
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.600]   and composed five original songs.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.440]   And we've been to...
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.840]   In the past year,
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.000]   we've been to 20 schools
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.880]   and we've met about 8,000 students
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.040]   and led 1,200 students to believe in Jesus.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.120]   I want to say that this is not a given.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.520]   The point is not the number.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.320]   The point is that
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.760]   I am a man,
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.920]   a man who seems to be very insignificant,
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.240]   but God can use me.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.360]   So today, he is not just using me,
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.040]   but he is using each and every one of you.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.200]   It's just a matter of whether you are willing to be used by God.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.040]   Thank you, everyone.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:14.800]   Thank you, Benson.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.440]   Let's give a round of applause to Benson.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.080]   He shared his life story with me in a very effective way.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.240]   In fact, this situation of pain and resurrection,
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.080]   when we went to school,
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.200]   we observed that many people,
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.400]   especially high school students, cried.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.200]   Okay?
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.320]   Because they really had a resonance.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.040]   The second thing is that we don't just believe in Jesus.
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.600]   Do you need to pray?
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.520]   Many people need to pray.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.600]   I need a way out.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   I have already gone to hell.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.560]   So the teacher and the pastor immediately responded,
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.360]   and immediately prayed for him.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:47.040]   So that he could have an experience.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.520]   So we found that it's not just the stage
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.600]   or the moment you're desperate,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.800]   but someone accompanies you through the process of life.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.280]   After death, you will be raised from the dead.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.680]   There is a position that cannot be replaced.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:00.280]   It is the pastor in the life of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.560]   He has to personally let us go through the process of death,
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.840]   and he is not afraid of doing harm.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.760]   They have to feel the faith of their whole life.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.040]   It's not just you talking about your faith,
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.000]   your witness.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.040]   They have to have a personal liberation of life.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.000]   I tell you, when we go there,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.760]   we are just a small team.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.480]   Our ability is very limited.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.960]   If you like music,
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.240]   you can worship together.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.120]   Let's walk together.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.240]   Not just here.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.760]   Can you organize a group of people to go to the mass?
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.240]   This is a challenge.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.320]   Many college students start to walk together like this.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.520]   They know it's not easy.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.080]   In the past, there was a gathering
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.320]   where we often had college students' DSC training.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.240]   There was a time when the pandemic was the most difficult.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:40.840]   The political situation was unstable.
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:42.440]   In 2020,
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.160]   my son was in the first grade.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:45.960]   And then,
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   he just finished his school in June.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.800]   After hearing that we need to witness,
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.840]   many college students came to the mass.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.720]   About 50 to 60 people.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.600]   Many of them knelt down.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.160]   They knelt down to respond to God.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.000]   The reason is that
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.520]   you don't have to stand in the middle for your generation.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.440]   You don't have to connect with God.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.640]   Can you do this for our generation?
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.440]   I called my son to visit.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.800]   He is not 18 years old.
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.960]   I don't know if he can still hear the echo.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.520]   Can you not just stick to this generation?
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.720]   You are over 18 years old.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.080]   You even passed the DSC.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.520]   Can you help our generation?
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.920]   Help us fight a battle.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.560]   Wow.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.440]   Many of them were touched.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.720]   Not just for this generation.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   What was the most touching?
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.560]   My son.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.840]   He was the last one to come out.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.280]   I said, "Son, I call my college students.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.360]   What does it have to do with you?"
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.520]   "Do you understand what I just said?"
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.000]   "Can you hear me? It's so deep."
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.200]   He said, "No, dad. I understand."
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.520]   And I don't want to just have college students
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.760]   to fight for me.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.040]   I also have to call my generation
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.760]   to fight for our generation.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.200]   We have to fight for our generation
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.760]   to win.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.080]   Wow.
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   I really appreciate it.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.480]   I held him and cried.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.600]   I prayed.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.120]   Actually, calling everyone
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.280]   has nothing to do with me.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.840]   I can only call my son.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.320]   He is my second son.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.960]   He is my generation's generation.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.560]   He is willing to be a
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.160]   Nasi Iyen worshiper.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.760]   He started to work hard on his equipment.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.400]   He wants to play the piano better.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.760]   He wants to be more like his peers.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.720]   Last week,
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.640]   he led 100 people to pray in a worship meeting.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.760]   He started to play the piano.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.280]   He started to speak out his voice.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.560]   He said, "I want to pray for this generation.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.320]   I only need you.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.840]   I only want to see you."
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.680]   Wow.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.840]   He and his generation cried out to Jesus together.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.440]   "We want you to be our center.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.840]   We want to continue to fight for your country,
[00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.320]   your will, and your unity."
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.200]   Hong Kong has these young people
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.400]   as our partners.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.600]   It's not just young people who fight.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:37.480]   The previous generation,
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.000]   college students,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.560]   or believers,
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.680]   you are already on the battlefield.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.880]   We need everyone to walk together.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.800]   When Moses was praying on the mountain,
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.200]   Joshua was the only one who won.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.160]   Joshua, you need to know
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.200]   you are not alone.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.800]   So when we came here,
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.000]   we distributed our prayer nets.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   We said, "Today,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.440]   we will pray for the young people of Hong Kong.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.680]   We will have a worship meeting
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.080]   and a message sharing.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.200]   We hope they will wake up.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.240]   We hope they can connect with God
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.960]   from all angles."
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:05.720]   We called them to pray.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.440]   We really want David to fight
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.520]   with his whole life.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:11.320]   We also want him to build a church
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.400]   in the next generation.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.320]   This is a beautiful church.
[00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.960]   But don't just stay in the building.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:19.960]   We need to become the church,
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.120]   the altar of the flow of blood.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.120]   We need to become the living altar.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.440]   This is worship.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.760]   Worship is life.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.280]   Worship is not when you are praying.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.640]   Worship is not when you are teaching.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.760]   Worship is our life.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:34.200]   Can we live out God's message like this?
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:34.840]   Lastly,
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   can you use all your strength
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.200]   to carry the burden of Elijah
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.880]   so that you can face
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:42.920]   double evil?
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.720]   We need the grace of God
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.560]   from the previous generation.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.920]   The favor of God.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:52.440]   Let's fight together
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.520]   in the Lord's presence.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.680]   I know we have limited time.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.520]   Sorry, I have 5 more minutes.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.600]   But I really want to pray for you.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.480]   Today, I don't need to call everyone.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.760]   The key number chosen by God
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:09.000]   is that one person.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.240]   To call Jesus,
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.560]   that person can walk into the gap
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.280]   and become a stone
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.680]   to turn the world.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.920]   But there is a foundation behind it.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.520]   Jesus came with 12 disciples
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:23.080]   and followed his path.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.840]   Then he turned the whole Roman Empire.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.480]   The whole world turned because of the gospel.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.240]   So today, if you are willing to say,
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.600]   "Lord, I am here.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.680]   I know I am the chosen one of your dream.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.560]   I know you chose me as the priest of the military
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.760]   to stand in the middle of the field to pray.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.160]   So that when we see the need for the church,
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.200]   we can go with you
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.240]   and our friends
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.480]   to the darkness.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:49.000]   We can be the light.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.320]   We are willing to be the saints
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.080]   and do all kinds of good deeds.
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:54.000]   We are also willing to ask you to help us
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:54.760]   to be the saints
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.000]   and be the children of God.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.320]   We can be united like this,
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.960]   to be united with each other,
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.200]   to be the same generation
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:03.400]   and to be the next generation,
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.680]   the new generation of the three or four generations.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.320]   Lord, please fill this heart
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.680]   so that we can continue to be strong for you.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.280]   Please hear our prayer in front of you.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:23.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
