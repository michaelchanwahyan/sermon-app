1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Before the last three weeks in quarantine, we had a wonderful time visiting friends and

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,320
 family in the UK.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,940
 There were many highlights.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:24,560
 This picture here shows my brother-in-law's 92nd birthday party.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,020
 Yes, 92.

6
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:34,440
 My sisters, who are 86 and 88, are pictured there.

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,640
 And ironically, they've all been in poor health since our visit, so our visit was perfectly

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,600
 timed.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,840
 We caught up with many friends, and you might recognize this couple.

10
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,880
 Actually, it's not a couple now, it's soon to be three.

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
 Yeah.

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,720
 Soon to be three, yeah.

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,840
 The expanding KFCI family, I love it.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,240
 Yeah.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:09,040
 But the highlight had to be Sandra's see and Sandra's daddy.

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,180
 He's 89.

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,300
 He's pictured taking his first haircut since the beginning of COVID.

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,540
 We had a haircut together.

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,040
 Now he's living alone.

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,360
 He has bone cancer.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:28,160
 And when Sandra hugged him, he said very sadly it was the first time he had received a hug

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,980
 in two years.

23
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:37,320
 And we were so grateful that we were able to celebrate Sandra's $2 birthday with him.

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,040
 I have a picture there.

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,560
 Now Sandra's dad lives in Wales.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,320
 And as you can see from the pictures here, it's absolutely beautiful.

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,480
 And we spent five weeks there.

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:01,960
 And the one thing you expect to see in Wales, apart from Welshman, are sheep.

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:10,760
 It is estimated that there are almost 1.2 billion sheep in the world today.

30
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:18,140
 Perhaps not surprisingly given its size, China has the highest amount.

31
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:25,920
 But it is in Wales where Sandra and I was, where there are actually more than three sheep

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
 for every person.

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,360
 Now that's a lot of roast lamb or a lot of wooly jumpers depending on which way you look

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
 at it.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,080
 But I understand New Zealand is even better.

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,060
 Five sheep for every person.

37
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,480
 And I want to tell you about sheep.

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,760
 One thing about sheep, their wool will grow forever.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,480
 And I want to tell you about a merino sheep in New Zealand.

40
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,580
 Remember five sheep per human that became famous.

41
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,480
 The unlikely name of Shrek.

42
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:09,720
 Back in 2004, Shrek the merino sheep hid in a cave for six years so he wouldn't have to

43
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,840
 get sheared.

44
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,360
 Shrek really did not like getting his hair cut.

45
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:28,320
 I know some teenage boys like that and a certain pastor whose name begins with Johnny.

46
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,060
 But by the time he was cornered and given his long overdue haircut on New Zealand national

47
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,600
 television and watch it, Johnny will probably get his haircut on Canadian TV, I don't know.

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:47,200
 That was enough wool to make 20 men's suits.

49
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,960
 Now sheep are mentioned in the Bible more than 500 times.

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,040
 That's more than any other animal.

51
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,200
 The prominence of sheep in the Bible grows out of the reality that sheep were important

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:12,320
 to the nomadic and agricultural life of the Hebrews and other Middle Eastern people.

53
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:21,240
 So it should be of no surprise to us that central to our KFCI nativity scene were the

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,200
 shepherds.

55
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:31,960
 Now make no mistake, the shepherds were a big part of the Christmas story.

56
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,320
 They were not just some extras on the movie of Christmas.

57
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,440
 Now Johnny mentioned last week that most of our mental images about Christmas come from

58
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,440
 either medieval art or hallmark Christmas cards.

59
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,600
 You know when we think of the shepherds, don't we?

60
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:59,600
 We have an image of gentle folk singing sweet songs by a campfire, you know, "Baa, baa,

61
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,440
 black sheep, have you any wool?"

62
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:11,200
 You know, the picture of shepherds in the field getting ready to hear angels sing evokes

63
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,280
 a positive pastoral image for us.

64
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,520
 It reminds us of Jesus' association with the Lion of David.

65
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:30,200
 But in reality, however, shepherding was a despised occupation.

66
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:38,120
 In the first century, shepherds were generally scorned as shiftless, dishonest people who

67
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,880
 grazed their flocks on other people's lands.

68
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,860
 They weren't the pleasant hallmark faces we're used to seeing this time of year.

69
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,520
 We have sentimentalised them so much on our Christmas cards and our art that they look

70
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,080
 like gentle folk waiting to go to our homecoming celebration.

71
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,160
 No picture is further from reality.

72
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:18,760
 Now notice, who did the angels go first to share the news?

73
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,520
 Notice who the angels tell?

74
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
 The shepherds.

75
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:32,040
 Doesn't that strike you as a little bit strange?

76
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,280
 It got me thinking.

77
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,880
 It reminds me of another event in the life of Jesus.

78
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,200
 I want to give you a question.

79
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,640
 Who was the first person that Jesus appeared to after his resurrection?

80
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
 Who was it?

81
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,600
 Sorry, do any of you read the Bible?

82
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,360
 I can recommend it.

83
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,240
 It was Mary Magdalene.

84
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
 Should we cut that bit out for the online audience?

85
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,640
 Sorry, guys.

86
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,440
 I'm sure everybody online knew it was Mary Magdalene.

87
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
 But what was Mary Magdalene?

88
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,720
 Firstly, she was a woman.

89
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,000
 Women at the time were definitely second class and still in some parts of the world today.

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,160
 They had no social standing.

91
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:34,240
 And not only that, but Mary Magdalene was a woman with a questionable past, to say the

92
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,140
 least.

93
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:50,320
 So at the beginning and at the end of Jesus' life, seeming nobodies were chosen to be the

94
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,560
 ones to whom the Messiah was revealed.

95
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,920
 Think about that for a moment.

96
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,840
 These nobodies became somebodies.

97
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,480
 Nobodies to the extent that we're still talking about them 2,000 years later.

98
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,320
 And that, my friends, is the story of Christmas.

99
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,520
 You may not have heard it expressed like this before.

100
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,660
 The story of Christmas is this.

101
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:32,940
 Nobody became a nobody so that nobodies could become somebody.

102
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,820
 Let me expand that.

103
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,780
 What we're talking about here is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords on his heavenly

104
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:55,820
 throne who gave up his heavenly throne for a manger in poverty in Bethlehem who would

105
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,540
 die the death of a common thief.

106
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:10,880
 Yes, somebody became a nobody.

107
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:21,420
 So that, so that wretched sinners like you and me could become sons and daughters of

108
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,460
 God.

109
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:32,060
 Nobodies could become somebodies.

110
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,100
 But I have a confession to make.

111
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,440
 In my former life, I used to be in the PR field.

112
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,560
 My job was to get maximum exposure for my company.

113
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:54,060
 You know, column inches, clicks and likes, TV coverage.

114
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:03,020
 When I look at the Christmas story on the surface, my natural tendencies come out.

115
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:09,360
 I want the angels to do something widescreen and high definition.

116
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,180
 I want them shouting from the mountaintops and parading the streets of Jerusalem saying,

117
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,440
 "Wake up and hear this.

118
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,920
 This should have gone viral."

119
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,520
 The angels should have gone to the temple to tell the religious leaders what God was

120
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,800
 doing.

121
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,980
 They should have gone to the governor and let him know that something awesome was happening

122
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,840
 in Bethlehem.

123
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,440
 They should have gone to Herod.

124
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,080
 After all, he was the king of Judea.

125
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,560
 They should have told him that God was doing a great thing in Bethlehem and that the king

126
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,600
 of kings had been born.

127
00:10:51,600 --> 00:11:00,200
 I mean, when Moses was born, God delivered him straight to the top, Pharaoh.

128
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:11,320
 Okay, via a basket in the River Nile, but the angels, instead of telling someone important,

129
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,780
 announced the Messiah's birth to a ragtag bunch of shepherds.

130
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,440
 That is not what we would have told them to do.

131
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:33,640
 That is not what we would have done, but it's what God wanted.

132
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
 I wonder why.

133
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,080
 Have you ever wondered why?

134
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,120
 I'm going to give you three good reasons.

135
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,680
 All good sermons come with three points, right?

136
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,560
 I'm going to give you three good reasons.

137
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,600
 Are you ready?

138
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,640
 Number one, He came because of them.

139
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,400
 In this account, we discover the heart of God and the true meaning of the birth of this

140
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,840
 child.

141
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:09,480
 Here is a graphic picture of Jesus, the one sent to the lowly and the outcast.

142
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:16,200
 In this picture, we are reminded that Jesus came for people like the shepherds.

143
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:27,780
 The shepherds, not the religious elite, the political savvy or the rulers of the people.

144
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:35,840
 The shepherds became the metaphor for the kind of people that Jesus came to save.

145
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:46,480
 If it were Hong Kong 2021, the angels might have appeared to street sleepers, refugees,

146
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,600
 domestic helpers, and with COVID in mind to frontline health workers.

147
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,400
 George says, amen.

148
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:03,200
 The angels came to shepherds.

149
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,640
 People doing what they do every day and every night.

150
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,800
 People going through the routines of life.

151
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,680
 People living their ordinary lives.

152
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:22,520
 Church, isn't that what the birth of Jesus is all about?

153
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,400
 It's about God meeting us.

154
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:35,400
 Not on high holy days, not in cathedrals and churches, but on ordinary days in ordinary

155
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:42,720
 places in an extraordinary way.

156
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:52,080
 The birth of this child is about God coming to us in our everyday lives and saying to

157
00:13:52,080 --> 00:14:04,140
 us, don't be afraid, but look, I proclaim to you good news.

158
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,760
 It's about God meeting us in our pain and loneliness.

159
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,040
 It's about God meeting us in our frustration and anger.

160
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,440
 It's about God meeting us Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

161
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:27,640
 It's about God wanting to be part of our lives every day.

162
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:37,360
 I think that's why God sent the angels to the shepherds to let us know that this child

163
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:45,680
 was for all people, even the most ordinary.

164
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,440
 I want to tell you a story of a guy called Will.

165
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,960
 Will was in his final year of college.

166
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,280
 He had wild hair, I mean wild hair, you know, wilder than yours, right?

167
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,480
 I got to say wild hair, right?

168
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:13,280
 He wore a t-shirt with holes in it, faded ripped skinny jeans and shoes with no socks.

169
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,240
 That was his wardrobe during his four years of college.

170
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,280
 Though mildly eccentric, he was a brilliant person.

171
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,360
 He became a Christian whilst attending college.

172
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,080
 He must have met Johnny.

173
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:34,960
 Across from the campus was a traditional church.

174
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:42,160
 They wanted to develop a ministry to students, but they weren't sure how to go about it.

175
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,480
 One day Will decided to go and worship there.

176
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,720
 So he walks in with his wild hair, t-shirt with holes in, faded ripped skinny jeans,

177
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,120
 shoes with no socks.

178
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,360
 The service had already started.

179
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,800
 Now students have no concept of time.

180
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
 Rather like some of you this afternoon at 5.30.

181
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,160
 I just want to say, right?

182
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:17,720
 Will started down the aisle looking for a seat, but the church was full.

183
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:24,120
 By now people were looking a bit uncomfortable, but no one said anything.

184
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,880
 Will got closer and closer to the front.

185
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,160
 When he realized there were no seats, he just sat down right on the floor.

186
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:43,880
 Oh dear, and although this is perfectly acceptable behaviour at a college fellowship, this had

187
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,560
 never happened in this church.

188
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:55,440
 By now the people were really uptight and the tension in the air was thick.

189
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,240
 Enter a deacon.

190
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,080
 Let's call him Tony.

191
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:11,760
 He slowly made his way towards Will.

192
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,160
 Now this deacon was maybe in his early seventies, a distinguished man with silver gray hair,

193
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,400
 wearing a suit and tie and using a walking stick, not like our Tony.

194
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,720
 Now everyone was thinking this, you can't blame him for what he's going to do.

195
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,800
 How could you expect a man of his age and background to understand some college kid

196
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:40,920
 thinking he can worship sitting on the floor?

197
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,840
 It took time for the man to reach the boy.

198
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:51,720
 The church became utterly silent except for the clicking of the man's walking stick on

199
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,480
 the tired floor.

200
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,680
 All eyes were focused on him.

201
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:03,560
 When the elderly deacon got next to the boy, he dropped his walking stick on the floor.

202
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:18,640
 With great difficulty, he lowered himself and asked Will, "May I sit with you?"

203
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:28,440
 The man sat down to Will, to Will with the wild hair and the t-shirt with the holes in

204
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:39,360
 with the faded skinny jeans and worship with him so he wouldn't be alone.

205
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:47,120
 Church, that's what the birth of Jesus means.

206
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,680
 I've defined it in this way, I've put it on the screen for you.

207
00:18:49,680 --> 00:19:04,960
 The birth of Jesus means radical action, radical behaviour, radical gospel, radical saviour,

208
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
 radical God.

209
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:13,640
 Now the next thing we see, point two is the shepherds were in shock.

210
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,080
 You can only imagine the first reaction of the shepherds.

211
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,240
 They were scared to death.

212
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,640
 They understood the appearance of angels as an omen, as though God was going to be bringing

213
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,480
 his wrath upon them.

214
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:36,700
 To allay their fears, the angels blurted out, "Don't be afraid for look, I proclaim to you

215
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,760
 good news of great joy.

216
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,840
 Today a saviour is born."

217
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:49,800
 And with that, the heavens opened with glorious music.

218
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,680
 It wasn't Ed Sheeran, but the heavenly chorus praised God and said, "Glory to God in the

219
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:02,840
 highest heaven and peace on earth to people he favours."

220
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:14,040
 In the midst of an ordinary night, ordinary shepherds encountered an extraordinary God.

221
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,480
 The shepherds must have been surprised that God broke into their ordinary lives.

222
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:30,320
 For us, Christ sometimes breaks into our lives when we least expect it.

223
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,640
 The picture you see on the screen is a man called Iphian Watkins.

224
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,840
 Iphian Watkins was a 65 year old retired Welsh minor.

225
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:52,600
 He loved Jesus and was desperate to know how God might use him in his senior years.

226
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,280
 He was sitting in the balcony of a church called King's Church.

227
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,840
 He was listening to a visiting speaker and minding his own business when the speaker,

228
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:15,680
 I kid you not, came off the stage, walked through the crowd and up to the balcony.

229
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,680
 He walks straight up to Iphian.

230
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:28,440
 Sitting before Iphian, the speaker looked him straight in the eye and said this to him,

231
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:36,960
 "God told me to tell you that you are not too old to start a church."

232
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,000
 That was the beginning of Ammanford Bible Church, known as ABC.

233
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 Now the relevance of this to Sandra and I, is it was Iphian and ABC that led Sandra's

234
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,480
 dad Eric, who you saw earlier, to Jesus at the age of 68.

235
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,200
 Eric is a handyman, was.

236
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,960
 He helped ABC physically rebuild the church.

237
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,520
 Most noticeably, he built the baptistry.

238
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:21,440
 And in August 2001, was the first person to be baptised in it, with both Sandra and I

239
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,380
 in attendance.

240
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:32,040
 As I said, God sometimes breaks into our lives when we least expect it.

241
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:37,600
 God met the shepherds where and when they least expected to be met.

242
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,880
 After all, that's what the birth of Jesus means.

243
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:51,480
 The third thing we see is that sometimes seeing is believing.

244
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,440
 And the heavenly chorus sang glory to God.

245
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,440
 After this powerful display of praise, the shepherds just had to see for themselves.

246
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,360
 So they ran off to Bethlehem to experience what the angels told them.

247
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,700
 When we got to Bethlehem, we read this.

248
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,520
 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger.

249
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,160
 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what they had been told them about

250
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:31,260
 this child and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds says to them.

251
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:40,640
 When God offers grace, the appropriate response is exuberant joy.

252
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:47,160
 I repeat that, when God offers grace, the appropriate response is exuberant joy.

253
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:53,600
 Eventually, the whole world would celebrate the coming of this child.

254
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:02,300
 But for now, only shepherds knew what had happened in Bethlehem.

255
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:07,880
 The result was the response that should arise from all God's people.

256
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,680
 Verse 20, I'll put it on the screen, says, "The shepherds returned to their flocks glorifying

257
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,240
 and praising God."

258
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,580
 As we read Luke's account, we're filled with wonder.

259
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,540
 We expect something miraculous.

260
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,640
 We expect the amazement to continue.

261
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,340
 We want the mystery of this moment to continue because if we're really honest with ourselves,

262
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,780
 we long for something amazing in our lives.

263
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:42,980
 Our routines are sometimes so predictable.

264
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,580
 Our schedules, particularly in Hong Kong, are so frantic and programmed.

265
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,820
 Our days are so packed with stuff.

266
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:56,220
 I wonder if we allow ourselves time to live.

267
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:03,280
 Yet as we hear the angels singing and the shepherds hurrying and Mary pondering, we

268
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:11,620
 feel we must just find a little time to wonder.

269
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:18,460
 And yet again, we are struck by the routineness of it all, the normalness of it all.

270
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:25,180
 We've come from angels singing to glory to the daily ticking of the clock.

271
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:35,620
 The challenge for us is to always find ways of celebrating the presence of God in the

272
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:41,300
 ordinary moments of everyday life.

273
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:53,620
 In the smile of a friend, in the sharing of a meal, in the beauty of good music.

274
00:25:53,620 --> 00:26:01,620
 As I conclude, one of the charges against the early church was this.

275
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:12,900
 In Acts 17, these men have turned the world upside down.

276
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:19,220
 When the shepherds had seen Jesus, their world was turned upside down.

277
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,980
 But the shepherds weren't content to just hear the message, were they?

278
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,540
 They wanted to learn about this saviour.

279
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,220
 And so without delay, they went to Bethlehem.

280
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,980
 It's interesting, isn't it?

281
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:40,260
 They didn't debate whether or not they had time to go, whether it was convenient for

282
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,260
 them.

283
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:47,460
 They didn't even worry about who would watch their sheep.

284
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,700
 They rushed to find out more about the saviour.

285
00:26:53,700 --> 00:27:01,700
 And so we shouldn't be content just to hear about the saviour.

286
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:07,820
 You know, I've come to church today, I've ticked my box.

287
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:14,900
 But to hurry to Bethlehem to see the Christ child.

288
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,220
 Don't be satisfied just to make a note of Jesus once a year in the Christmas carols

289
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,020
 or in a Christmas service.

290
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,420
 But we should come and learn about him often.

291
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:32,580
 God's plan of salvation is awesome.

292
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,940
 And it has many facets to it.

293
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:43,020
 The more you listen to it and learn about it, the more joy it brings into your life.

294
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:51,700
 And it will prepare you to face any kind of difficulty you may have to face.

295
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,700
 Now don't get me wrong.

296
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:59,820
 There is nothing wrong with looking forward to our Christmas customs of opening presents

297
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,100
 and sharing dinners with loved ones.

298
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:10,460
 Yet those customs can never replace the real reason for our joy at Christmas.

299
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:18,140
 The birth of Jesus Christ, the saviour from sin.

300
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:27,060
 Don't let the customs crowd out the basics.

301
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:36,460
 Don't let the decorations and landmark replace the baby in the manger.

302
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:45,260
 Celebrate, celebrate like the shepherds by listening to the angel's message.

303
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,260
 That is what the birth of Jesus means.

304
00:28:50,260 --> 00:29:00,180
 And church, as we sang earlier, go tell it on the mountains.

305
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:09,340
 Joy to the world, the Lord has come.

306
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,700
 Amen.

307
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:19,700
