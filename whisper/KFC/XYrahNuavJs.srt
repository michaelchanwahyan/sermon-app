00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
早安,大家好

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
我們現在在讀什麼書呢?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
記不記得?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Titus

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
上星期,Irene教授幫我們分享了

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
是不是?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
第一章

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
我先考考你們

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
下一個頁面

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
誰寫了第一章的書?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
誰寫了Titus的書?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
誰寫的?

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Titus寫的?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
誰同意Lucas的?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
舉手

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
沒有人同意?

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Tim也同意,是吧?

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
你同意?

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
為什麼你同意?

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
(Either Paul or Titus)

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
OK,好

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Either Paul or Titus

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Titus寫了一封信給他自己

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
這是你的想法

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
是Paul寫給Titus的

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
為什麼寫給Titus?

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
他現在知道Titus在哪裡嗎?

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
我們看下一個頁面

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
保羅是做什麼的?

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
記不記得?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
有人知道保羅的工作是做什麼的?

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
(宣教)

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
什麼?

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
宣教

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
他在哪裡宣教?

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
我們可以看看

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
他有很多不同的使命的旅程

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
紫色的

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
不知道看不看得到

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
紫色是他第一個旅程

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
紅色是第二個旅程

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
然後淺紫色好像是

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
第三個旅程

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
OK

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
他在第三個旅程的時候

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
在一個使命旅程的時候

47
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
他遇到一個人叫Titus

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
他的Titus現在去了什麼國家?

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
應該叫Crete

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Crete是現在屬於什麼國家?

51
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
記不記得?

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
有人知道?

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Crete

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
有沒有人去過Crete?

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
是不是Crete?

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
他屬於哪個國家?

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
我給你一個選擇

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
第一是埃及

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
第二是土耳其

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
第三是俄羅斯

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
OK

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
誰是埃及的?

好

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
好

72
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
俄羅斯

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
你試想像一下

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Titus在這個地方叫Crete

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
以前是羅馬控制的

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
保羅就寫信給他

77
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
寫信給他

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
為什麼?

開店?

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
怎樣做生意?

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
保羅就寫信給他

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
怎樣去賺錢?

85
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
是不是?

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
是不是這樣?

87
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
是不是我們上個星期學到的?

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
是不是?

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000

上個星期呢

92
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
保羅就在第一章跟Titus說

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
我們怎樣去聘請領導人?

94
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
領導人有多少個素質?

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
上個星期學了

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
有多少個素質?

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
記不記得?

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000

保羅就開始

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You however must teach what is appropriate to sound doctrine

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Sound doctrine是什麼?

109
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What is sound doctrine?

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Living Bible

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000

202
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Teach the older men to be temperate, worthy of respect, self-controlled, and sound in faith, in love and endurance

203
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Temperate是什麼意思?

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
有人知道嗎?Temperate

209
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Temperature,對嗎?

210
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000

214
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Temperate是什麼?

215
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000

217
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Temperate

218
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ethan呢?

219
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Ethan懂嗎?

220
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
你Google,OK,你Google一下

221
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
OK

222
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Gabe呢?

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
教什麼?Temperate是什麼?

224
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Control their temper

225
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Control their temperature

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Control temper,OK

227
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Control temperature

228
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
有沒有人可以控制自己的temperature?

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
舉手,有沒有?

230
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
你教我吧,我不懂

231
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
OK,temperate是什麼?

232
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
是clear minded, sober

233
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
不要被不同的influence intoxicate你

234
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
他們之前是有沒有

235
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
誰有帶水瓶的現在?

236
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
有沒有帶水瓶?有

237
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
你怎麼拿水的?

238
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
是不是在湖那裡,是不是在harbour那裡浸上來的?

239
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
是不是?不是

240
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
你有pipes的,water pipes

241
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
他們之前有aqueducts,maybe

242
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
OK,但是有沒有什麼water filter system?

243
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
誰家裡有water filter system的?

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
OK,你們沒有的?

245
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Timon,Ocean,你們沒有的?

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
沒有water filter system的?

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
知不知道是什麼?

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
你好

249
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
OK,誰有water filter system的?

250
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
你們沒有的嗎?Lucas

251
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
你喝什麼水的?

252
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
有?OK

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
誰boil water的?還是boil water?

254
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Gabe是boil water

255
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Vincent,you use a filter system,no?

256
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
你不喝那些filter water的?

257
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Really?OK

258
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Alright

259
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
OK,之前他們沒有filter system

260
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
他們多數喝什麼?知不知道?

261
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
喝什麼?

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
不是,是喝什麼?

263
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
喝酒,為什麼喝酒?

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
因為酒會什麼?

265
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Alcohol will sort of cleanse the water

266
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So it's better for their health

267
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
是不是?但是喝太多酒會怎麼樣?

268
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
有沒有人試過?

269
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
不用舉手,Lucas?

270
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
沒有,因為他們point了來

271
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
OK,喝太多酒就會drunk了

272
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
所以保羅就叫Titus去remind那些older men

273
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You temper it,you clear mind it

274
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
想事情是清楚的

275
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
不可以像醉了一樣去想事情

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
第二,是worthy of respect,honorable

277
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
是不是?

278
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
誰覺得他們的外公外婆很honorable

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
worthy of respect,舉手

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
OK,是不是?

281
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
我們為什麼respect他們?

282
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
因為他們很辛苦

283
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
之前去養大家庭

284
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
我們respect他們

285
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
因為他們可能go through

286
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
生命go through了很多不同的東西

287
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
OK?

288
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Titus就要教這些older men

289
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
去worthy of respect

290
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
self-control,又是好像temperate一樣

291
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
差不多的

292
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
還有最後,to be sound in faith, love, and endurance

293
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
信心,愛心,和patience, endurance

294
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
他想這些older men是healthy的

295
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
live a healthy lifestyle

296
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
他和神的信心,愛人,和他們的patience是healthy的

297
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
那麼,number one

298
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Older Christian men should set an example of faith, love, and patience

299
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
這個就是我爸爸

300
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
我爸爸做什麼的,記不記得?

301
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
做什麼的?

302
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
做牧師,是不是?

303
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
我覺得他是一個older man

304
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
是一個very good example

305
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
為什麼他是一個好example呢?

306
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
他對神,愛神,是很深的

307
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He has a great love for God

308
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
還有他很愛人,是不是?

309
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He loves the people in church

310
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
and he's always sharing the gospel

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He's focused on the right things

312
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He sets a good example of faith, of love, and of course patience

313
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Because he had me, right?

314
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
是不是?

315
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This must be a joke

316
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
第二,older women

317
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Older women, next

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Titus就叫那些older women要做什麼呢?

319
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Sorry,要回到之前的slide

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Likewise, in verse 3

321
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
回到scripture

322
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live

323
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine

324
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But to teach what is good

325
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They then can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children

326
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
To be self-controlled and pure

327
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
To be busy at home, to be kind

328
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And to be subject to their husbands

329
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So that no one will malign the word of God

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
好,保羅叫Titus教那些older women做什麼呢?

331
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
第一,是reverent, in the way they live

332
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
reverent

333
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What is reverent?

334
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
reverent,是好像sacred這樣

335
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
sacred,可能是保守一點

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Not to be slanderers

337
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
知不知道original language slander的word是什麼呢?

338
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Slander的word是什麼呢?知不知道?

339
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You're discussing it, right?

340
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Diablos

341
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Diablos是什麼呢?

342
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What does it mean, Diablos?

343
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It means the...

344
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Diablos是什麼呢?

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, it means slander

346
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But what does it represent, Diablos?

347
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
你們沒聽過嗎?

348
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It means the devil

349
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
OK,可能保羅就叫Titus

350
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That these older women should not be doing the devil's work

351
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It could be including slander or gossip or whatever

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
還有,not addicted to much wine

353
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
跟那些older men差不多

354
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
To be sober minded

355
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
之後,teach what is good

356
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The older women 有什麼責任?

357
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
去教什麼?

358
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
教the younger women

359
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Older women is teaching the younger women

360
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
我們看到,the second point

361
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
How older Christian women should live

362
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Set an example in modesty

363
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Counseling the younger women

364
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And teaching them

365
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
A good example of this is my mom

366
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
我媽媽是教書的

367
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
她教...

368
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
叫什麼?

369
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Language as a second... sorry

370
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
English as a second language

371
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
To immigrants

372
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
她教了很多年

373
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
我們去了加拿大,她就教了

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
She's teaching

375
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
還有她是很modest

376
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
She's very proper

377
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And she is very careful in the way that she dresses

378
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And she represents herself

379
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
還有她很counsel the younger women

380
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
They counsel the younger women

381
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
So I think my mom is a good example

382
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
知道這裡是哪裡嗎?

383
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
是不是香港?

384
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
不是,猜猜,在哪裡?

385
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
大阪,yes

386
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
誰去過?

387
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Anybody? Good

388
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Alright

389
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
有older men,有older women

390
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
第三是younger women

391
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Ok, younger women 舉手

392
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Younger women 舉手

393
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
不知道是誰

394
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Ok, good 有點response

395
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Ok, younger women

396
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
是要怎麼樣?

397
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Teach the younger women

398
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That they can urge the younger women

399
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
To love their husbands and children

400
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
To be self-controlled and pure

401
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
To be busy at home, to be kind

402
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
To be subject to their husbands

403
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So that no one will malign the word of God

404
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
之前在Roman society

405
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
之前,sorry, can we skip to slide 2?

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The one with the triangle

407
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The one with the triangle

408
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Seven slides later

409
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
看到嗎?

410
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
橙色的

411
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Ok, 之前他們找的時候

412
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Ok, 之前的Roman culture是怎樣的?

413
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
誰是run Roman culture?

414
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
第一是Emperor

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Emperor多數是什麼名字?

416
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Caesar salad

417
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
是你吃的

418
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Caesar salad

419
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
然後是Senators

420
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
好像他們經常圍圈,聊天

421
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
什麼policy是好

422
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
然後是Equarians

423
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
不只是跑馬

424
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
是很高級的家庭

425
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
之後是Workers

426
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Workers叫People

427
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Lower class

428
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Foreigners和Slaves

429
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
那些Slaves

430
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
那些Women有什麼角色?

431
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
那時候在Roman society

432
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
現在的角色是

433
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Women, they can do everything

434
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
They can vote, they can be CEO

435
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
They can do everything

436
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
但之前的Roman culture

437
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Women有什麼角色?

438
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
有沒有人知道?

439
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Cindy有沒有人知道?

440
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Cindy知不知道?

441
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Women有什麼角色?

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
在Roman culture

443
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
生BB

444
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
生BB,OK

445
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Housekeeping

446
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Housekeeping

447
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's all

448
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Housekeeping和生BB

449
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
都是類似的

450
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
之前的Women

451
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
According to the Roman culture

452
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No chance to vote

453
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
No chance to have a job

454
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
They were protected by the husband

455
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The husband or the father

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Just like

457
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Sort of in the

458
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
所以The lower women

459
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The younger women

460
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
是什麼?

461
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
所以Titus就叫

462
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The older women

463
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
去教The younger women

464
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
要怎樣?

465
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Love their husbands and children

466
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
愛他們的家庭

467
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
第二, self-control and pure

468
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
第三, busy at home

469
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
她要幫忙家裡的工作

470
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
她之前的角色是這樣的

471
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Be kind and submit to their husbands

472
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So that no one will malign the word of God

473
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
為什麼要submit to the husband?

474
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
因為神創造家庭

475
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
誰是The head of the family?

476
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Who is the head of the family?

477
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The husband is the head of the family

478
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
God has designed the husband

479
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
to lead the family spiritually

480
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So that the wives should support

481
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and be the helpers to the husbands

482
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So the younger women should

483
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Love their family

484
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
愛他們的家庭

485
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
還有什麼?

486
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Carry out the duties of the family

487
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And be self-controlled and pure

488
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Someone just died

489
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He was very loved

490
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Who was that person?

491
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Queen Elizabeth

492
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Does anybody watch The Crown?

493
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
在Netflix, The Crown

494
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
有沒有人看過?

495
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
只有五個看過

496
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
好不好看?

497
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
好看

498
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
When you watch The Crown

499
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Then you will sort of understand

500
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The life and duty of a queen

501
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
辛苦嗎?

502
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
都辛苦的

503
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
經常有媒體看著你

504
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
經常要live a very strict life

505
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
吃東西也很strict

506
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
跟人聊天也很strict

507
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
很多不同的customs you follow

508
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's not that easy

509
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't know about her faith

510
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
我不知道她的信心是怎樣

511
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't know whether she was Christian or not

512
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
But what we can learn from her

513
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Is that she really valued her duty

514
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Her sense of duty

515
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
To fulfill her obligation as a queen

516
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Titus is telling the older women

517
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
To teach the younger women

518
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That they should do the same

519
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
To love their family

520
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
To carry out their duties of the family

521
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And to be self-controlled and pure

522
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
第四是younger men

523
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Younger men 舉手

524
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
誰是younger men?

525
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
不認識嗎?

526
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
不認識自己是誰?

527
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
誰是younger men?

528
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You guys are younger men

529
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
不知道嗎?

530
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
還以為你們是children

531
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You are older men?

532
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
OK

533
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Younger men 我們繼續讀

534
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Similarly, encourage the younger men to be self-controlled

535
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
In everything, set them an example by doing what is good

536
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
In your teaching, show integrity, seriousness, and soundness in speech

537
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That cannot be condemned

538
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So that those who oppose you may not be ashamed

539
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Because they have nothing bad to say about us

540
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
只說了一樣東西

541
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Younger men 是叫Titus應該教他們怎樣

542
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Be self-controlled

543
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
你們覺得你們有沒有self-control?

544
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Ethan, Clement,有沒有self-control?

545
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
No, no self-control

546
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
看得出

547
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Joking, joking

548
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
OK

549
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Self-control

550
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Out of 10, rate yourselves

551
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
你們有多少self-control?

552
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
10是最多的

553
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
1是最少的

554
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
3, 2, 1 舉手

555
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
每個人都要舉手

556
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
不舉手出來跳舞

557
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
和Tim一起跳

558
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
OK

559
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
1, 2, 3

560
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Jasper,你是1嗎?

561
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
OK

562
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
誰沒有舉手出來跳舞?

563
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Sebastian出來跳舞

564
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
OK

565
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
OK

566
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
誰舉手比3多?

567
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
OK, sorry, 舉手比3少

568
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
比3少

569
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
你們覺得你們沒有self-control?

570
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Really?

571
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
OK,我們要做一個series on self-control

572
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
誰是3 to 5的?

573
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
舉手,3 to 5

574
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
OK

575
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
誰是5 to 8的?

576
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Self-control, 5 to 8

577
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
OK

578
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
8 and above,舉手

579
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
8 and above

580
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
因為覺得他很有

581
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Caleb, self-control

582
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
(笑聲)

583
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
OK

584
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
OK

585
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
self-control 容易嗎?

586
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
誰覺得他們再大了

587
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
會有更多self-control?

588
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
As you grow older, you'll have more self-control

589
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Raise your hand

590
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
誰覺得是?

591
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
OK

592
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
OK

593
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Auntie Carmen和Uncle Paul

594
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
為什麼你覺得是?

595
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Experience

596
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
OK,你知道什麼是對,什麼是錯

597
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
做錯了,可以學習

598
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
對嗎?

599
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
OK,有什麼補充?

600
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
OK,maybe?

601
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Alright,我小時候

602
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Next slide

603
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
我小時候覺得自己沒有self-control

604
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
我經常在教會走來走去

605
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm just full of energy

606
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
OK,現在也差不多

607
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
到處走

608
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
媽媽經常捉著我

609
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
不要走

610
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
我們現在的世界

611
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
是給予很多不同的temptation

612
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
很多不同的temptation

613
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
OK

614
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
例如

00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Next slide, video game

616
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
誰覺得對打機的時候沒有self-control?

617
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
有人在打機嗎?

618
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
有人在打機嗎?

619
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000

620
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Caleb,還有沒有?

621
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
有人在打機沒有self-control的?

622
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
舉手

623
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
OK,不承認

624
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
OK,沒有人覺得打機的時候很難self-control

625
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
沒有嗎?

626
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Really?

627
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
很有self-control

628
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
OK,next slide

630
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
誰覺得看劇集的時候

631
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
是很難self-control的?

632
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
舉手

633
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
OK

OK,多一點

635
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000

Next slide

639
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
用social media是很難self-control的

640
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
舉手

641
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
OK,OK,alright

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
下一個不用舉手了

644
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
OK

645
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
很多人在

646
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
可能你那個教會

647
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
不是教會

648
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
學校可能體驗到

649
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
這些不同的drugs,alcohol

650
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
是不是vaping很popular的?

651
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
在你教會

652
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
不是教會

653
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
學校

654
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
學校,在你學校

655
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
OK

656
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No vaping at church

657
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
可能你學校

658
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
很多人是很喜歡vaping的

659
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
OK

660
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
我們這個世界

661
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
很多不同的temptation

662
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
是不是?

663
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
打機

664
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
補劇

665
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000

666
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
不同的drugs,alcohol,substance abuse

667
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
那麼,Titus就urge

668
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
要urge那些younger men

669
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
去be self-controlled

670
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
be self-controlled

671
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
OK,last one

672
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
最後一個group

673
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
記不記得最後一個group是誰?

674
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
slaves

675
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
OK,let's read together

676
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
1,2,3

677
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything

678
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
to try to please them

679
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
not to talk back to them

680
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
and not to steal from them

681
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
but to show that they can be fully trusted

682
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
so that in every way

683
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
they make the teaching of God, our saviour,attractive

684
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
這個教會

685
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
回到這個教會

686
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
是有不同的人的

687
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
有older men

688
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
有younger men

689
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
有older women

690
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
有younger women

691
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
slaves都是一起的

692
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
教會是accept

693
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
誰?

694
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
all people

695
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
free and slaves

696
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
higher class and lower class

697
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
在耶穌

698
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
in our identity with Christ

699
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
we are all brothers and sisters

700
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
OK,we are all brothers and sisters

701
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
但是在之前的羅馬society

702
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
slaves是什麼?

703
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
是什麼class?

704
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
lower class

705
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
as you see in the next slide

706
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
lower class

707
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
之前的slaves是怎樣?

708
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
it says here

709
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
treated as property

710
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
slaves had no rights

711
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
and had to obey their masters

712
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
treated as property

713
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
OK

714
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
好嗎?

715
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
treated as property

716
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
誰覺得好?

717
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
沒有的,是嗎?

718
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
they had no rights

719
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
they couldn't vote

720
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
they couldn't own property

721
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
they couldn't do a lot of things

722
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
但是保羅呢?

723
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,000
就叫Titus去教這些slaves去做什麼?

724
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
第一

725
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
就是be obedient

726
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
be obedient

727
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
subject to their masters in everything

728
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
他要聽他的master說

729
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
是不是?

730
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
聽他的master說

731
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
第二

732
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
是be respectful

733
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
try to please them

734
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
not to talk back to them

735
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
OK,try not to talk back with them

736
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
誰在學校跟他的teachertalk back?

737
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
有沒有?

738
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
沒有試過?

739
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
有沒有?

740
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
沒有啊?

741
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
very good

742
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
they are respectful

743
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
OK

744
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
然後呢

745
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
第三

746
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
not to steal from them

747
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
but to show that they can be fully trusted

748
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
之前的slaves可能是偷了他們的東西

749
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
為什麼偷了他們的東西?

750
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
可能馬上走了

751
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
偷了他們的金

752
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
偷了他們的

753
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
不知道什麼

754
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
馬啊

755
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
我不知道他們以前偷了什麼

756
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
slaves need to be trustworthy

757
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
OK

758
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
slaves need to be trustworthy

759
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
我們可能上班都可以是這樣的

760
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
是不是?

761
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
都可以是這樣的

762
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
next slide

763
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
我們上班的時候

764
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
都是be obedient to our bosses

765
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000

沒有上過班?有

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
你上過什麼班?

769
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
咖啡店

770
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
咖啡店

771
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
你聽誰說的?

772
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
在咖啡店

773
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
我媽媽不想我在家睡覺

774
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
OK

775
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
你媽媽鼓勵你上班

776
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000

777
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
好

778
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
你上班的時候有沒有聽過老闆說的?

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,000
有

780
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
OK

781
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
他好像不知道

782
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
有沒有對老闆很respectful?

783
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
有禮貌的?

784
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000

788
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
老闆信不信你?

789
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
你覺得你信不信他?

790
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000

791
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000

795
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
我們今天上班的時候

796
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
都是要有這樣的attitude

797
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
to be obedient to our bosses

798
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
to be respectful

799
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
and to be trustworthy

800
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
好 我們recap

801
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000

802
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
how you to be an example

803
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000

804
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
to be honorable

805
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
older women to be modest

806
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
don't do the devil's work

807
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
to teach younger women

808
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
older women have the responsibility

809
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
to teach the younger women

810
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
the younger women 要怎樣?

811
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
愛他們的家庭

812
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
去照顧他們的家庭

813
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
to be self-controlled and pure

814
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and the young men to be self-controlled

815
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
and the slaves to be obedient

816
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
respectful and trustworthy

817
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
難不難?

818
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
誰覺得難的?

819
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
做這些事

820
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
OK

821
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
覺得很容易嗎?

822
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
你們

823
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
不舉手那些

824
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
很容易吧?

825
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
很容易

826
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
我不需要聽這道經

827
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
我已經在做了

828
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
對吧?

829
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
很好的性感態度

830
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
那我們怎樣可以

831
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
跟隨聖經這樣說?

832
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
我們怎麼可以這樣做?

833
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
這麼難

834
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
又要設定一個例子

835
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
又要自我控制

836
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
我們怎樣?

837
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
怎樣可以做到這些?

838
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
我們怎麼可以這樣?

839
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
我們怎麼可以這樣?

840
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000
有什麼建議?

841
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
有什麼建議?

842
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
沒有建議

843
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
就放棄吧

844
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
對吧?

845
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
祈禱

846
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
OK

847
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
祈禱,讀聖經,去教會

848
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
那個Sunday School的答案

849
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
對吧?

850
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
都是對的

851
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
不是錯的

852
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
OK

853
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
我們

854
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
The fruit of the spirit

855
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
The fruit of the spirit

856
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
是什麼?

857
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Love

858
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
然後呢?

859
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Joy

860
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Peace

861
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Patience

862
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Kindness

863
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Goodness

864
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Faithfulness

865
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Gentleness

866
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And

867
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Self-control

868
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
有很多時候

869
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
我們控制不了自己

870
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
對吧?

871
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
有些情況我們控制不了

872
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
我們控制不了

873
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
我們無法控制自己

874
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
對吧?

875
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
可能這個世界有很多不同的試探

876
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
可能我們自己有軟弱

877
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
在這個時間

878
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
我們要依賴誰?

879
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
我們要依賴誰?

880
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
We have to trust in the Lord

881
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
神就給了我們什麼?

882
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
什麼?

883
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
誰?

884
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
神給了我們誰?

885
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
聖靈

886
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
If you have asked Jesus to be the Lord and Savior of your life

887
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You have God inside of you

888
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
聖靈會在你裡面

889
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
The Holy Spirit will guide you

890
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Will teach you

891
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And will help you

892
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
所以做這些事情

893
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
保羅叫Titus教這個教會

894
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
做這些事情

895
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
是不容易的

896
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
我們每個人都有軟弱

897
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
我們每個人都有不同的失敗

898
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
但我們要怎樣?

899
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
繼續去依賴聖靈去幫我們

900
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,000
To ask the Holy Spirit to give us strength

901
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Self-control when we are weak

902
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So the Holy Spirit won't take over your life

903
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It won't take over your life

904
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
You need to submit to it

905
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
You need to submit to it

906
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
聖靈怎樣去幫你?

907
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
它不是會take over你的life

908
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
你是要怎樣?

909
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Submit

910
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Surrender to the Holy Spirit

911
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Surrender your desires

912
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Surrender your life to the Holy Spirit

913
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
So that he can fill you

914
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,000
With his power and his presence

915
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
明白嗎?

916
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
誰不明白的?舉手

917
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
不明白的

918
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Surrender our life to the Lord

919
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Ask God to help you

920
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
In general

921
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
我們做基督徒

922
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
現在是要怎樣?

923
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
In general

924
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The next slide

925
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
第一是self-control

926
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Live a self-controlled life

927
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
It's not easy

928
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
We need to rely on the Holy Spirit to help us

929
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
In all things

930
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
We need to be self-controlled

931
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
我們上學

932
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
做不做功課

933
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
procrastinate

934
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
或者做功課

935
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
是要self-control的

936
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
有不同的試探

937
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
We need self-control

938
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
We need to follow the Holy Spirit's guidance

939
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
第二

940
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
In general

941
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
我sum up不同的

942
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
保羅叫Titus

943
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
不同的teaching

944
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
第二個

945
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
In general teaching

946
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,000
是setting an example

947
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
在2 Timothy

948
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
保羅叫Timothy做什麼?

949
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
To set an example for the believers

950
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
in speech, in life, in love, in faith, and in purity

951
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Don't let anyone look down on you

952
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
because you are young

953
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
But set an example for the believers

954
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
我們在高中

955
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
我們在大學

956
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
都可以set an example

957
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
God has called us to set an example

958
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
for Christians how to live

959
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,000
第三

960
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Summary

961
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
第三

962
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
responsible for the duties

963
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
that God has given you

964
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
神給了你有什麼duty?

965
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
What duty has God given you?

966
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
去做什麼?

967
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
做學生

968
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
誰是神給了你duty去做學生的?

969
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000

Very good

973
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,000
誰給了你duty去照顧家庭的?

974
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Very good

975
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
神給了每一個人不同的duty

976
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
可能是很多,可能是很少

977
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
但是你負責任

978
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You are responsible for them

979
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
OK

980
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
最後

981
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,000
How do we live as a Christian?

982
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
這個世界有那麼多temptation

983
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
我們怎麼可以真的有self-control?

984
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
We need to love God more than the world

985
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
我們要愛神多過這個世界

986
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
How do we be self-controlled?

987
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
We need to love God more than this world

988
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
我們愛神多過這個世界

989
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
因為如果我們愛神

990
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
我們不會想做事去傷害這個relationship

991
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
和神

992
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
如果我們吸毒會傷害神的feeling

993
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,000
因為我們傷害我們自己的body

994
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
神不想我們傷害我們自己的body

995
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
神是想我們做我們的duty

996
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
可能是做學生,上班,照顧家庭

997
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
如果我們愛神

998
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
我們會做這些事

999
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
我們會fulfill our duty

1000
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,000
We need to love God more than the world

1001
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
如果我們愛神

1002
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
我們會有relationships

1003
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
that are pleasing to God

1004
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
有些relationship is not pleasing to God

1005
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Maybe that relationship you have with that girl or that guy

1006
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
girlfriend or boyfriend

1007
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
is not pleasing to the Lord

1008
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
But if you love God more than the world or yourself

1009
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
You will choose to follow the Lord

1010
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Even though it's hard

1011
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So three questions today

1012
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:53,000
第一,我們有沒有依賴聖靈給我們self-control

1013
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
The fruit of the spirit is self-control

1014
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
第二,am I setting an example for others, other believers

1015
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,000
If people know you are Christians

1016
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
they will see your example

1017
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
如果人家知道你是基督徒

1018
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
they will see your example

1019
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:23,000
第三,am I being responsible for the duties that God has given me

1020
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Let us pray together as the worship team comes up

1021
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
我們一起祈禱

1022
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
神父,我們感謝您的教導

1023
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
在泰律斯二章

1024
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
不容易滿足神話

1025
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
不容易自我控制

1026
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
不容易滿足我們的任務

1027
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
不容易設立一個例子

1028
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
但我們祈求,通過您的聖靈

1029
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
通過我們向您投放我們的生命

1030
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
讓我們有能力

1031
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
在我們弱點之中

1032
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
神父,我們更愛您

1033
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
比世界更愛您

1034
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
讓那份愛對於神

1035
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
給我們能力和恩典

1036
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
為您生存

1037
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
我們在耶穌的名下祈禱

1038
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Amen
