[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   Amen.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:18.560]   I have been told that I should use this, so I'm going to confess here, I am not like
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.600]   Pastor James where he just preaches without notes.
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.280]   I need notes.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.880]   So I'm going to kind of use this so that we can stick with the rules instead of breaking
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.880]   it.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.720]   So we're going to try to share God's word.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.720]   I'm going to move around.
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.720]   Is that okay?
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.720]   Is that okay?
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.240]   I was asking them, do I need to wear a mask or not?
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.240]   Because the whole situation, but praise God, we could actually go to places now and not
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.240]   necessarily wear a mask.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.240]   So I'm just really grateful.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.920]   How many of you miss John and Sandra, Pastor John and Sandra?
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.920]   Amen.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.120]   We miss him tremendously at our first pastors gathering, prayer gathering that we have every
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.800]   single month.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.480]   And it's really interesting because I don't know what it is, but pastors and free food
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.480]   always brings many of them out.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.960]   So we had a bunch of pastors, we were able to gather together and we just realized how
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.040]   big of a shoe it is to fill in when Pastor John and Sandra, they're not with us.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.440]   So I pray that all of us will be in prayer for them.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.640]   As you know that they're in a very difficult situation.
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.240]   So we're praying that they'll quickly come back to Hong Kong.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.240]   Hong Kong is always better when we have Pastor John and Sandra joining us.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.520]   So praise God for that.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.520]   Amen.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.240]   So we're going to be praying together.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.760]   And one of the things that I do want to share is that I've been really encouraged.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.200]   I was just watching some of the different announcements and different things that you're
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.960]   doing and what a great encouragement and also an opportunity to actually minister to many
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.480]   people who have yet to hear the gospel through these different avenues of people with mental
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   health and struggling through different grief and different situations.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.280]   So my encouragement to you is that take advantage of all the different opportunities that you
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.560]   just heard by Bonnie and just the different things that are happening in this church,
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.880]   especially the Easter retreat.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.920]   What a great way to bond together and experience God together.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.920]   I'm sharing this.
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.160]   Pastor John didn't tell me to say this, but I'm just sharing this because it is a blessing
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.960]   for all of us to be a part of all that he's doing.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.380]   So I'm going to go ahead and ask us to turn to Ephesians if you have your Bibles.
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.440]   If not, it's going to be up here, so don't feel uncomfortable.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.320]   I'm going to talk about just simply together.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.520]   That's what I'm going to try to address.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.160]   And I talked to Pastor John and he kind of gave me an overview and I watched his sermon,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.180]   the first one that he actually gave through video.
[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.360]   It was such a blessing because as you remember in that video, one of the things that he mentioned
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.000]   as I was listening, I was really excited for you as a church, the body of Christ, is that
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.960]   the vision was us, you, them.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.120]   What a great concept.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.480]   What God is doing in us and then you have then have a responsibility to do something
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.160]   about that and to be able to reach out to the city.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.760]   That's why it was encouraging to hear that you're going to focus in on equipping the
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.220]   saints so that you can serve the community.
[00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:22.580]   I'm joining you in prayer, in spirit, in asking God to use this church to be able to be a
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.260]   blessing to Hong Kong.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.100]   And so as you're turning to Ephesians chapter 4, we're going to just look at six verses
[00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.300]   today.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.780]   And I want to start off with a question and the question is this, did you ever come to
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:41.500]   the realization that you were the actual cause of disunity?
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.040]   I want you to think about that for a moment because a lot of times we're not self-aware
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.860]   that we're actually the cause of disunity.
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.220]   In fact, can I challenge us to kind of think about our relationship with our families?
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:01.220]   The thought that we are actually the cause of disunity within our families.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.100]   Think about maybe at work with some of your colleagues that you can actually be the one,
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.060]   whether you're gossiping or maybe you just don't like that person, but you're the cause
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.340]   of disunity.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.420]   It might be among some of your friends group, the people that you hang out with, that every
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.100]   single time you're there, there are other people who don't want to be there.
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.500]   Or when that other person is there, you don't want to be there and you realize that you
[00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.140]   cause, you are one of the causes possibly of disunity.
[00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.180]   And the reason why I want to start off this way is to actually tell you my story.
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.420]   I really didn't have a heart for unity.
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.460]   I didn't think that it was very important.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.660]   I knew it in scripture, but I just didn't see it practically lived out.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.900]   So I want to share a story back in 1996.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.060]   My wife and I, we actually graduated from the university.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.060]   I went to seminary.
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.260]   I served as a youth pastor for about four and a half years.
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.340]   And then my wife and I, we went to University of Michigan to start our church, Harvest Mission
[00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.800]   Community Church back in 1996.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.740]   And we were young.
[00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.500]   You know that one song, "Young, dumb, and broke"?
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.460]   That was us.
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.920]   We were so young.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.220]   We thought the whole future was ahead of us.
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.100]   We thought we knew what we were doing.
[00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.340]   Well, at least I did.
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.220]   And this feeling of, we're going to conquer the world.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.780]   So we came to the University of Michigan and we started the church.
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.700]   And one of the things I wanted to do was just kind of meet with different people who are
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:38.340]   already on the campus doing ministry, church leaders, as well as pastors.
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.260]   And I was just kind of thinking about this.
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:46.380]   And when I look back at that time, man, I was thinking to myself, if I met someone like
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.380]   myself back then, I would have probably hated this guy.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.100]   I'm like, "Who is this guy?"
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:57.180]   And one group that I kind of butted heads with were some of the parachurches at the
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.260]   University of Michigan.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.260]   And so pretty much I was trying to explain to them, "We're not a parachurch.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.620]   We're a local church.
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.100]   And we're going to reach out to students and we're going to do all this stuff and we're
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.140]   going to change the world."
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.460]   And I remember they kind of gave me this look like, "Who are you?"
[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.460]   And I just didn't care.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.900]   I didn't care what they thought.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.220]   We're going to go and do this.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.740]   And guess what happened?
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.020]   Pretty much all the parachurches would list all the names of churches that you could attend
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.780]   to and they purposely decided to not put our names out because they're like, "Who are
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.780]   these guys?
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.940]   We don't want someone like him to be a part of this community."
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.700]   So in many ways, I said, "You know what?
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.700]   We don't need you.
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.460]   We're going to do our thing."
[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.340]   And so this went on for several years until a morning prayer.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.260]   We had a time just every Monday through Friday we had this morning prayer at 6.30 in the
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.300]   morning.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.620]   And so I was in my own prayer and I was praying for the city.
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:07:01.740]   I was praying for God to send a revival in the midst of Ann Arbor, Michigan.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.100]   And as I was praying, I was like, "God, why aren't you sending a revival?
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.900]   Why are the hardness of hearts?"
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.340]   I was just sharing all this stuff to God.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.940]   I was pouring out my heart.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.420]   And all of a sudden, I heard or it felt like a voice, an audible voice, but it was more
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:15.420]   of impression.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:16.780]   I just felt like...
[00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.720]   I'm like, "What is the cause, Lord?"
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.160]   And I felt like God was saying, "You are the cause of the lack of revival."
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.380]   Of course, the first thing is, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:33.160]   You know, that surely is not from God.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.020]   But in that moment when I felt that that was impressed upon my heart, I was thinking about
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:46.740]   this and I said, "Lord, if it's me, I'm causing the sense of disunity in this city, then I
[00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.500]   repent."
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.160]   And I spent some time that morning just repenting and God started bringing me all these different
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.620]   thoughts and experiences and my interactions with people in that city.
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:03.040]   And I realized that it was out of my pride and I did not come humbly to be able to say,
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.340]   "God is already doing something and we need to partner together."
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:12.040]   And so it was in that moment where I was feeling this conviction of the Holy Spirit and then
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.680]   I felt something else.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.340]   And this part, it was really Satan, "Get behind me."
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:24.420]   Because I felt God was telling me, "From your mission's budget, I want you to bless some
[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.000]   of these ministries with no strings attached.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.780]   Give them cash, bless them.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:37.940]   No strings attached, say, "Hey, we want you to build up your ministry so we can see the
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.120]   city reach with the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.520]   Man, that was tough.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.880]   I thought maybe I was halfway sleeping, I misheard, but I really felt that's what God
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.880]   was saying.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.040]   So what I did was I went to our executive team and I told them what God was kind of
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:59.600]   placing on my heart and we had some funds from our missions fund that we wanted to use
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:05.740]   and we ended up giving some of that money to various ministries with no strings attached.
[00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.040]   And here's the exciting part.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.600]   After that happened, I just felt like something broke.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:18.160]   Whatever was bringing a sense of disunity, something broke.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.240]   And after about four or five years, I'm just building some of those relationships that
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.160]   I completely cut off.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:31.960]   After about four to five years, we had the largest student gathering in a big auditorium,
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.880]   about thousands of students to worship God all together in unity.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.840]   And that was probably one of the most powerful moments where God spoke to me about the importance
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:52.520]   of unity, not only in the church, but in the one church in that city with many congregations.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.680]   And it was in that moment God started to put that seed of not only that repentance that
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:06.880]   I needed of my pride, but also that seed of a vision that God can actually use not just
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:15.680]   that one church, your church, but he uses all the churches as we are united together.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.760]   And that's when I just saw God doing some amazing things while we were serving there
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.720]   at the University of Michigan.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:28.960]   I don't know what it is, but sometimes we don't realize the importance of unity and
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:35.560]   the power of unity until there is that moment of realization.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.640]   I want to share a picture with you, some pictures.
[00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.000]   I don't know if some of you have seen this before.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.440]   This is American football.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.840]   I know they call football here something different.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.520]   They call it soccer in the United States.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.200]   But as some of you are familiar with American football, you probably have heard this on
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.200]   the news.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:59.720]   It was January 2nd of this year, so the beginning of the year.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:06.360]   The Buffalo Bills were playing against Cincinnati Bengals, and one of the players from the Buffalo
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:11.000]   Bills, he ended up having a cardiac arrest.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.720]   And DeMar Hamlin, he ended up collapsing on the field.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.480]   And that's when just people started gathering together in prayer.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.000]   In that moment of crisis, we saw people gathering together to pray.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.100]   And here's the picture that someone took, and they were in prayer together.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.120]   But the picture that I love the most is this next picture.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   They were at the hospital.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:38.480]   You can tell Cincinnati Bengals fans, along with Buffalo Bills fans, because all things
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.680]   be equal, they hated each other.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:48.320]   But here they are coming together because of a crisis, because of a situation.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.920]   That's why there is something about difficulties that bring people together.
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.440]   I think about Hong Kong and everything that has transpired in the last five some years,
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.640]   or even longer.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.560]   And as you know, there are many people moving on, they're going to other places, and Lord
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.960]   bless them, this is the calling that God has for them in their lives.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.940]   But many of us are here in Hong Kong, and this is part of our calling.
[00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.600]   So what is it that God is trying to do?
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:21.540]   So in the midst of so much change, in the midst of everything that has been happening,
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.320]   what is it that God is trying to do?
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.760]   And I'm wondering if one of the things that He's trying to do is that He's trying to bring
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.200]   the churches together in the midst of the situation that we're experiencing.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.320]   He's trying to bring the church of Jesus Christ together.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.320]   I love what D.L.
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   Moody said.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:46.040]   He said this, he says, "I have never yet known the Spirit of God to work where the Lord's
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.800]   people are divided."
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.940]   Isn't that true?
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:57.320]   When the people of God are divided, it's very difficult to see the Spirit of God move.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.200]   That's not only true in your family, especially if the dad and the mom, they're not united.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   You can feel the tension.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.260]   You've been there.
[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.960]   Some of you are parents.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.440]   Some of you are children of parents, and you've seen the disunity and how it breaks down the
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.440]   family.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.660]   There's tension, there's anxiety.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.680]   You'll see it not only that, but as I mentioned before, in the workplace.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:25.280]   You'll see that in the church, and you'll definitely see it in a city where it's so
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.400]   easy to compare churches against other churches.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.840]   It's so easy to say, "Wait a minute.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   What happened to all these people?
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.680]   Oh, they left and they went to another church."
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.360]   And we're like, "We hate that church.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.160]   They're taking our members."
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.880]   Or those of you who came from another church, we love you.
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:42.880]   Welcome.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:43.880]   Welcome.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:50.720]   But once again, it is so easy to lose sight of what it is that God has to him because
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.760]   of the division and because of this disunity.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:05.080]   So Kung Fu Church International 2023, as you really focus on just being equipped as the
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:10.700]   saints of God, I pray that you will serve the community so well.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.680]   And as we link up together with all the churches in Hong Kong, that's one thing I really miss
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.000]   about Pastor John.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.320]   He's always talking about the one church in Hong Kong with many congregations.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.040]   I love that because that's been my heartbeat and that's what God has been reminding me
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.040]   time and time again.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   There's only one church.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.040]   Come on, everyone said that.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:35.520]   There's one church with many congregations.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:40.780]   That's Hong Kong, one church with many different congregations.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.180]   And so the one thing that I want us to remember as I get into this text is that we live out
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:51.260]   our calling with clarity as we fulfill our calling to unity.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:58.100]   That we live out our calling with clarity as we fulfill our calling to unity.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.860]   I'm going to highlight two things in these six verses that talks about living out our
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.400]   calling with clarity as we fulfill our calling to unity.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:12.600]   The first thing is this, that we must have ownership of our calling.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.680]   That we must have ownership of our calling.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.380]   It's important to put this passage in context.
[00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:26.100]   In chapter one, chapter two, and chapter three of the book of Ephesians, Apostle Paul is
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.100]   presenting more of his theological values.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.540]   Some of you have read the book of Ephesians, you realize a lot of it is talking about who
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:40.580]   we are in Christ, what he has done, and how he has brought people, the Gentiles and the
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.320]   Jews together.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.500]   And everything he mentions in the first three chapters are all theological foundations that
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.340]   he's building up until we come to chapter four.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:55.640]   Now he's talking about in light of chapter one, two, and three, what do we do now with
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.860]   all this information?
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:01.380]   And that's where we dive in to chapter four.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:06.820]   And all the way to chapter six, so chapter four, chapter five, chapter six, it's simply
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:12.940]   practical things lived out in light of what he talked about in chapter one through three.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.820]   And so that's why we want to talk about this ownership of our calling.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.300]   There are two things that we notice when it comes to this ownership of our calling.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:23.940]   The first is you've got to remember the gospel.
[00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.340]   If you are going to have ownership of the calling that God has given to you, then you
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.700]   have to remember the gospel.
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.700]   Let's go ahead and read verse one, it should be up here.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.820]   The verse one, it says this, "I therefore a prisoner for the Lord urge you to walk in
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:44.340]   a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called."
[00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.320]   So here's Apostle Paul, right away we notice two words up there.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.780]   In verse one, that's very important, I want to highlight those two words for us.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.260]   The first word is therefore.
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:59.860]   What it's doing is that it's connecting that everything that Paul established, once again,
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:05.660]   in chapters one through three, now he's putting it into practice in our daily lives.
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:13.600]   So he says, "This, this, and this, therefore," now he's bringing it home to speak to us.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:20.620]   What he's emphasizing is what you believe determines how you will live.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.220]   I want you to think about that for a moment.
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.700]   What you believe will determine how you live.
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.440]   So if you believe success will make you happy, guess what you're going to do?
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.120]   How you live your life.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.100]   If you think to yourself, and what you believe is that, "Oh, if I have a relationship, then
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.540]   that's going to make everything, all my problems go away," then that's what you're going to
[00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.080]   act upon.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:49.420]   What you believe is so important and determines what you do.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:54.700]   That's why Paul is clearly establishing that everything that I have said to you in the
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:18:01.040]   last three chapters, it is the foundation now of how I'm going to share with you how
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.260]   you ought to live your life.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.740]   That's why the second word that's very important is the word urge.
[00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.100]   It can be translated as implore or to appeal.
[00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.920]   So I implore you, I appeal to you.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.560]   If you want to look at a different translation, I beg you.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:24.380]   So he's saying, because of everything that Christ has done, therefore, I am begging you,
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:29.580]   I am imploring you, I am appealing to you.
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.040]   And what is he appealing?
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.840]   What is he imploring us to do?
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.380]   Now before I mention it, this is what I want to speak to us because we live in Asia.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:44.620]   I know not everyone is Asian by birth, but you live in Asia, so let me just say this.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.820]   When you are from Asia, and this is some of you, this is all you know, the gospel that
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:55.440]   many of you know is based on works.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.440]   How do I know this?
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.580]   Think about it this way.
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.740]   When bad things start happening to you, then what is the first thing that you do?
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:02.740]   Oh, I got to do something.
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.060]   Oh, I should read my Bible.
[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:05.300]   I don't read my Bible.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.480]   I should pray.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.380]   Or let's put it this way.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.460]   It's going to be that first blind date with that somebody.
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:15.940]   And then you're like, oh Lord, let it be.
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.220]   Let it be.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.220]   So what do you do?
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.260]   I got to read the Bible so that God will bless me.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:27.700]   See, that's a works mindset, which says that if I do something, that God will do this.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.980]   And that is a totally anti-gospel.
[00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:37.540]   The gospel simply says God has already, he has already done something for us.
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:38.540]   Amen?
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.220]   He has done something in our lives.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:46.780]   So now what we are doing, it is out of a motivation because of the gospel.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:54.020]   That's a gospel-oriented mindset that simply says we do things because God first loved
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.260]   us.
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.500]   And that's what the urging is based on.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.260]   Therefore, I urge you because of what Christ has done.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.340]   This is very similar to Romans chapter 12, verse 1.
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.340]   And I want you to read the yellow sections with me.
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.340]   Will you do that?
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.180]   It says this, "Therefore, I urge you, brothers," what?
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:21.340]   "In view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.340]   God."
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.140]   This is your spiritual act of worship.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:29.340]   So what he says is this, in view of God's mercy, you've already received mercy.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.260]   Therefore, he's urging us to do what?
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.420]   To offer yourself.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.060]   That's a gospel-oriented way to live your life.
[00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.740]   We do things because God has already done something for us.
[00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:46.060]   And we're motivated because of who Jesus Christ is and what he has done.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:50.200]   Paul exhorts the believers to walk in a manner worthy of the calling.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.400]   That word "to walk," you'll see this quite often in Paul's letters.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.220]   It is in reference to this concept of "to live."
[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.580]   So when you're walking, you're living.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.260]   That's what Paul is simply saying.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.400]   To walk means to live.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:11.940]   And that's why he is reminding us to walk or to live in a way that is, what?
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.860]   In a manner worthy of the gospel.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.940]   Some of us might not understand this, but the word "worthy," in this context, it means
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.700]   equal weight.
[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.340]   So I want you to think about that for a moment.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.620]   Paul says to walk or to live in equal weight.
[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.940]   What is he trying to say?
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:35.740]   Well, this idea of calling comes from our, what Christ has done, which allows us to be
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:41.100]   a child of God, and then through salvation, which was purchased by Christ, nothing we
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.940]   have done, we can't earn it.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:50.420]   So because he has purchased this salvation for us, this importance of the unity in the
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:55.020]   body that we're part of this family, that is what he's emphasizing.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:01.100]   Now Apostle Paul is telling the believers to live in such a way of that one's calling,
[00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.340]   your calling.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:07.900]   It should be equal weight or in balance.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.480]   What does that mean?
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:15.980]   That means that you and I, we both have individual responsibility as well as in the context of
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.460]   the church and the world.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.460]   Let me put it this way.
[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.500]   Maybe this will help us understand.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.500]   Please do not raise your hand.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:23.580]   It's called a rhetorical question.
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.580]   I want you to think about it.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:31.780]   How many of you have met a hypocrite in your life, in the church or a person who calls
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.780]   a Christian?
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:33.780]   You're like, "I haven't met him."
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.140]   It might be you, all right?
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:42.220]   So I would say all of us know of people who are like hypocrites, and they are saying one
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.460]   thing, but they're not living it out.
[00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.220]   So they're not in balance.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:51.380]   They're not walking or living according to what is being said, and that's the part that
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:52.760]   turns people off.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:58.500]   So here's Paul, and he says to live a life that is worthy of the calling, that's equal
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:05.380]   weight so that what Christ has done for us will be reflected in how you live your life.
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:11.380]   Now this is a powerful thought because as you remember this gospel, guess what happens?
[00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.620]   What will help you have ownership of this calling is now you got to respond to the gospel.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.780]   That's the second thing.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:17.900]   You got to respond to that.
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.740]   Not only do you remember the gospel, but now you respond to the gospel.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.420]   Let's read verse two and three.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.020]   This is what the Word of God says.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:30.180]   "With all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:35.140]   maintain the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace."
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:41.620]   It is clear that as we remember the gospel, this will enable us to be more responsible
[00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:44.720]   in living for Christ.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.480]   We have to know how this ought to be lived out.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.020]   That's why in verse two and three, Paul gives some of these characteristic traits of how
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.420]   we to live our lives in response to the gospel.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:02.580]   The words and phrases such as humility, gentleness, patience, bearing with one another in love,
[00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:08.900]   and maintaining all unity, all these things point to this one concept of reconciliation.
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.300]   You cannot have reconciliation when there's no humility.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.660]   Think about some of your relationship with people that you don't get along with.
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.740]   There's either you or that person, there's no level of humility, that's why it's hard
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.180]   to reconcile.
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.120]   You can only have reconciliation when there's humility.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:25.700]   Think about patience.
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:31.480]   You cannot have reconciliation when there's no patience, which is forbearing.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:37.820]   You are willing to go through it and endure some of the people's messiness.
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.220]   It's difficult.
[00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.260]   Let's be honest here.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.740]   When there are those people who are very toxic or maybe very draining on you, they're like
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:47.780]   the extra grace required people, you're like, "Oh my God."
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.500]   And you see them like, "Okay, I got to go to the bathroom."
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.140]   Those types of people.
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.580]   And it's difficult and it's hard.
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.700]   But when you are patient because you think about, "Man, God has been patient with me.
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:05.380]   Man, I screwed up, I messed up, I hurt somebody, but that person forgave me."
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.260]   And you think about the gospel, you remember the gospel, then your natural response is,
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:14.540]   "I need to respond to it in the same way."
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:20.300]   Just think about the opposites of these things, pride, harshness, impatience, frustration.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.780]   They don't promote unity or reconciliation.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:29.820]   This is what happens when we have ownership of our calling as well as unity within the
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.260]   body of Christ.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:37.860]   That's why in verse three, as we read, the word "maintain" is translated as "to keep,
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:42.020]   to stay within, or to guard."
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.220]   So listen to me.
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.220]   This is really important.
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.660]   We got to get this in order to understand unity and what Paul is saying.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:57.340]   When Paul says, "Maintain the unity," what he is trying to clearly state is that we already
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.860]   have it because of Jesus.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:06.340]   The reason why we are united is because of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.220]   That's why we have to watch over it.
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.760]   That's why we have to continue to maintain it.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.180]   That's why we have to sustain it.
[00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.660]   It's not like we're not unified and we need unity.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.140]   No, we have unity.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.140]   Why?
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:24.100]   Because Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, and therefore he has made two into
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.500]   one, Gentiles and Jews.
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:32.580]   And he's saying, "Jesus provided and you have this unity because of Jesus, so now you and
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:37.860]   I, we are responsible, and the ownership of this is to maintain it."
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.140]   We have to keep the unity.
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.560]   We're not trying to discover it.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.100]   We're not trying to form it.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.560]   We're not trying to create it.
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:49.500]   We already have it, but we have to now maintain it.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:53.980]   I love what Johnny Erickson Tata in her book, A Step Further, writes.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.240]   She writes this, "Believers are never told to become one.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:02.780]   We already are one and are expected to act like it."
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.820]   We're one because of Jesus.
[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:10.600]   If you know Jesus, and as I know Jesus, we are one.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:15.920]   If you have confessed your sins as Jesus Christ, as your Lord and Savior, and someone else
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.700]   has done the same, you are one.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.500]   One of the things that I love is when I travel around to different places.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.820]   I mean, there are times when I'm in different countries where they're singing a song in
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:29.180]   a different language, and I don't even know what they're saying.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:32.840]   Well, hallelujah, I know because it's universal.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:37.100]   So that's when I sing really loud, you know, because like, "Hallelujah."
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.260]   You know, we sing really loud.
[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.660]   That part of it, it's a universal thing.
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.480]   You've been there, you know.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.140]   But it's amazing because even though I don't know them, even though we just met maybe an
[00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.180]   hour ago, there's a kindred spirit.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.180]   Why?
[00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.160]   Because of Jesus Christ.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.680]   So we're already one.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:00.520]   Now we have to maintain it, sustain it.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:06.800]   So when I think about all the churches in Hong Kong, we have unity because of whom?
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.440]   Jesus Christ.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.080]   So that's why we have to keep on working at maintaining it.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.120]   That's why the pastors gather together once a month to pray, to fellowship.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   Why?
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.400]   Because we need it.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.840]   That's why I want to know what's going on in your church.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.840]   Even though your church might be bigger than mine, your church is better in this area than
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.720]   our church, but we love you.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:32.480]   You're a very important part to this community, to Hong Kong, to reach every single person,
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.560]   7.4 million people.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.680]   We need you.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.360]   We need you to survive.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.560]   Even in the midst of COVID, when so many churches are closing down, we need you to be a part
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:47.400]   of this community because of what Jesus Christ has done.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:57.000]   That's that responsibility to say, "We are one and we need to maintain it."
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:05.300]   That's why in Galatians chapter 5, verse 16, 22 to 23, and also 25, that idea of this walking
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:10.300]   and being in step, the only way we're going to get it is through the Spirit of God.
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.120]   That is the thing that maintains the unity is the Spirit of God.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.120]   Paul says what?
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.160]   And I want you to read the yellow sections with me.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.480]   Can you just say it with me?
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.800]   It says this, "But I say, walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:28.720]   flesh, but the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.680]   faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.200]   Against such things there is no law.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.540]   If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit."
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:42.000]   So walking and living in the Spirit of God.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.480]   How about us this late afternoon, early evening?
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:52.060]   Do you remember the gospel and what God has done in your life?
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:57.840]   How do you respond on a daily basis because of the gospel?
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:03.800]   Do you have ownership of your calling that Christ has purchased for us on the cross?
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:09.420]   Not only as a follower of Jesus Christ, but somebody who you're supposed to maintain this
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.720]   unity of the Spirit.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.360]   If you don't have ownership of it, then we're not going to be able to maintain this unity.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.640]   And I want to speak to all of you right here because this is your church.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.640]   This is your church family.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:25.920]   But it's just a microcosm of the bigger church family here in Hong Kong.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.200]   If you cannot maintain the unity in this group, even though the age is different, even though
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.280]   ethnicity might be different, language sometimes, if you're more comfortable with one language
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:40.440]   over another, if there is no unity here, we cannot unify with or maintain the unity with
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.600]   other churches here in Hong Kong.
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.640]   That's why we've got to pray in the Spirit and ask Him to help us.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.600]   Let me close with the second point.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:56.600]   We must not only have ownership of our calling, but we see here that we must have oneness
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.720]   within our calling.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.600]   Oneness within our calling.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.880]   I really hate to do this, but I'm going to show you this picture.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.800]   Can we look at this picture?
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.400]   I really hate to do this because I'm a Chelsea fan.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:20.060]   But because I love Pastor John so much, I decided to show this picture.
[00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:25.480]   And when I saw this picture, I said to myself, "This is great."
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:31.120]   Not only because we have a Korean, because I'm Korean-American, so praise the Lord.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.620]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:39.160]   But something about the Spurs, as you look at them, and many other sports teams often,
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:45.880]   is that there's a sense of diversity and different races, but they're united together because
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:52.080]   there's a common goal to win a championship.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.880]   The Premier League, EPL.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:02.480]   And so when I look at this picture, I realize we have people from Caucasian or white descent,
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:09.120]   we have a Korean there, we have someone from an African descent or background, but they're
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.600]   together because of that common goal.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:17.600]   And then I was thinking, well, sports actually brings not only the players, but if you look
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.240]   at the next picture, just even the fans.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.060]   I mean, you have people from maybe the Arab background, you have people from the white
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.560]   descent, and you have some people from Africa.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.560]   I mean, where are the Koreans?
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.560]   I don't know.
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:40.480]   But anyway, you just see that diversity even in the sports.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.480]   And I want to share this because this is what Apostle Paul is saying as we close out in
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:51.440]   these next couple of verses, is this idea of this oneness.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:57.020]   What he is emphasizing is we have this within our calling.
[00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:01.640]   So once you have this ownership, and then you begin to understand this oneness that
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:08.480]   has to come, that's part of a calling, then maintaining unity can be done.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.240]   So let's read verse four through six.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.520]   This is what the Word of God says.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.040]   "There is one body and one spirit, just as you were called to the one whole that belongs
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:23.960]   to your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is over all
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.320]   and through all and in all."
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:34.840]   What a way to close out this section in verse six, and also verse four and five.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.080]   So what is the significance of this?
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:42.920]   Paul mentions seven, seven key foundational components that establish and provide the
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.880]   spirit of unity as followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.080]   I want you to notice the word "one."
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.660]   Everyone say "one."
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:58.020]   You will notice that word repeated over and over again to describe each of these components.
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:04.600]   It shows the centrality of the call to unity.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.400]   So one body, this is the universal church.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.680]   It's not just one church like here, but it's one body.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.120]   It's the universal church around the whole world.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:23.440]   And how many of you heard from Pastor John all the time, like, "There's only one church
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.020]   in Hong Kong."
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:30.320]   And I believe that, and I resonate with that, because there's not all these churches, but
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.880]   there's only one church.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.760]   The second thing is one spirit.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.620]   It's in reference to the Holy Spirit that dwells in us.
[00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:41.560]   It doesn't dwell in those who do not know Jesus Christ, but it dwells in us as believers
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.200]   and in the church.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.160]   That's why there's one spirit.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.400]   It talks about one hope.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.760]   What is it referencing to?
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:54.760]   It's referencing to all the believers that the way we regard our future is in Christ
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.840]   and is with God.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:01.220]   So it's this idea of there's a hope that we have that is so different from anyone else
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:05.920]   in this world, and it's one hope because it is found in Jesus.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:08.120]   The fourth thing is one Lord.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.360]   It's a reference to Christ, who is the shepherd of the whole church.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.120]   So it's that one Lord.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.080]   The one faith is in reference to both.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.560]   If you look at some of the commentaries, they will say it's both the subjective faith as
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:26.720]   well as the objective faith, that it is our faith in Christ, but also this faith that
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.720]   we have as we live our lives.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.840]   One faith.
[00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.240]   One baptism.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.000]   This can be referenced to water baptism or the believers' identification to Christ's
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.040]   death and his resurrection, but it is one baptism that we all believe in, that we have
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.320]   died to ourselves, and now we resurrect from the dead.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.000]   And then lastly, one God.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.680]   This is a reference to God being the Father because of the relationship with Him and through
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.040]   Jesus Christ.
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:59.280]   That's why not only are we related in that way, not by blood, but we're connected because
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.440]   we have one Father.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.760]   Now, we conclude that through these important foundational elements, we are united together
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:13.160]   because God the Father, as we put our faith in Jesus Christ and our identification with
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.280]   this baptism.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.000]   I want you to notice verse 6.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.040]   I don't know if you have seen this.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:24.760]   We notice in that last verse, I love verse 6, we notice the word "all."
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.680]   Everyone say "all."
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:29.720]   It is repeated four times.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.880]   From this passage, verse 6, can we go back to verse 6?
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.040]   I just want to read this again.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.040]   Okay, we're going to have to go through all this.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.040]   Sorry.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:47.960]   It says, "One God and Father," and it says, "of all, who is over all, and through all,
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.040]   and in all."
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:54.080]   So from this usage of this last verse, we notice several things.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.600]   I'm going to close with this.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:00.660]   God is Father to all His followers.
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.840]   That means that we see God is this Father of those who put their trust in Him.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   We are His children.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:10.460]   That's why it says, "Father of all."
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:16.880]   God is sovereign over all because God is supreme and in control of all things.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:22.080]   God works through all His followers because that's why it says it's through Him and all
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:27.880]   is through Him is because He's operating in the life of the believer and He's using His
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.160]   spirit.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:33.040]   And lastly, God dwells in all His followers.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.520]   God's presence lives within us.
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:40.720]   Paul used similar language when he described the preeminence of Christ to the people of
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   Colossae.
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.140]   In Colossae chapter 1, verse 16, I want you to read the yellow section with me.
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.140]   Listen to what it says.
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:52.060]   "For by Him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:59.840]   thrones or dominions or rulers or all authority, all things were created through Him and for
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.840]   Him."
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.360]   It's the preeminence of Christ.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:08.320]   And the beautiful thing about us, because of Jesus Christ, we can maintain this unity
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.940]   and become one.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.560]   It doesn't mean we all look alike, we all do the same thing, but there is unity in the
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.920]   midst of diversity.
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.060]   There is this oneness because of Christ.
[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.760]   How about us this evening?
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:28.080]   Do you know that we have oneness because of what Christ has done for us?
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:33.400]   Are there people in your life who are believers that you're not living in unity with?
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:39.300]   Maybe someone has hurt you, maybe some people have left or you've come from another church
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.560]   because you've been hurt.
[00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:46.300]   Is there this lack of unity with other believers?
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:51.560]   Are there people that you see in other churches, instead of lifting them up, it's easy to criticize
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:56.280]   them, "Oh, they don't have this kind of doctrine," or "They don't do this," rather than saying,
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.720]   "God, He is our Father and we are united.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.640]   Let's maintain the spirit of unity."
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.120]   That's why this is simply the gospel.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:12.240]   The gospel says that God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Spirit, they were in one,
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.200]   they were together.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.560]   He created Adam and Eve.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:22.320]   And in that oneness that they had, sin entered in.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:27.800]   And it brought enmity with God and themselves and even amongst one another.
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.960]   That's where shame was introduced, as they had to cover themselves because they realized
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.960]   that they were naked.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.960]   And if you look all throughout history and throughout the Bible, you realize that they
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   were sinning against this Holy God.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:48.040]   But this is the beautiful story of the gospel, that Jesus Christ, the Son, was sent into
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.040]   this world.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:54.840]   God is amazing because God the Father, He longed for us, so He sent prophets.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   He sends kings and different people so that the Israelite people will know that they have
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:05.660]   a calling to be a blessing to the nations, so that all the nations can be blessed.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:08.360]   But they failed in their mission, and guess what happened?
[00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.640]   That's why Jesus had to come.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.160]   And He lived a perfect life that you and I could not live.
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:21.040]   And when He lived this perfect life, He became a perfect sacrifice, and He died on the cross.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.240]   That should have been our cross, that should have been our death, because we should be
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.200]   punished for our sins.
[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.440]   But Jesus took our place.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:34.960]   This is the reason why when He died and rose again from the dead, the very thing that Satan
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:40.440]   had as his last weapon, which was death, Jesus Christ conquered that.
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:45.560]   So that means now, when you put your faith and trust in Jesus Christ, you will be part
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:54.640]   of this incredible spiritual family, that you will be one with not only God, because
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.240]   the walls of enmity has been broken down, but you will be one with other brothers and
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.280]   sisters in Christ.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:07.800]   If you place your faith in Jesus.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.760]   And I pray that one of these days, if some of you are still seeking, that you will make
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.320]   that commitment.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:17.820]   If you are a believer, I pray that you will maintain this unity, so that people will know
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:22.160]   that we are His disciples, if we love one another.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:27.280]   So once again, the one thing is, we live out our calling with clarity, as we fulfill our
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.920]   calling to unity.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:36.000]   Before we leave here, one of the things that I try to do in our church is, let's not just
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.120]   sit there and say, "Oh, that was okay, that's good information," because information will
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.600]   not change us.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:47.160]   It is the Spirit of God, as we apply these things and obey, where we will experience
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.540]   transformation.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.440]   So can I just give some practical next steps?
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:55.200]   You just pray through, let the Holy Spirit speak to you.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.740]   You could do one, you could do two, or however the Lord speaks to you.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:04.040]   In light of this message, as we talked about how we live out our calling with clarity,
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:10.600]   as we fulfill our calling to unity, I'm just going to use the word "one," O-N-E.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.920]   The first thing is this, own your part in unity with humility and prayer.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   Own it.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.360]   That means pray for this church, pray for one another.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:24.560]   Be humble, that that person, you're not better than them, you're not more righteous than
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.480]   them.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.260]   But you've got to love them because Christ first loved you.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.620]   So own that.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.500]   You own the unity when you are humble and you pray.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:40.540]   My hope is this church will be a praying church.
[00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:44.340]   Let's pray and bring our hearts together, especially the retreat and so many other things
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:49.700]   that God is providing for you, that you will pray and have this, maintain this unity.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.660]   The second thing, not only to own our part in unity with humility and prayer, but the
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:58.500]   second thing is network together to serve God.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:03.660]   There are so many opportunities in this church that God is providing for you through the
[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.020]   pastors and the staff where you can get involved.
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:10.580]   And as you work together, you'll see great things.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.120]   I'm excited for what God's going to do this year for every single one of you.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:21.780]   Because as you are being equipped by those that God has called to equip you, you will
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:25.340]   be able to then go and serve the community.
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:29.380]   I'm just so excited as we think about the One Campaign, as we think about so many other
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.860]   things.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:35.280]   One of the things we're praying about is how do we serve the city?
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.980]   And so one of the things we're going to try to do is we're going to just find a day and
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:43.260]   you know, it's so easy to say, well, you guys already broke that.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:45.020]   I was going to say, Sunday's the day we worship.
[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:46.300]   No, Saturday too.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.500]   And so here we are on Sunday, we come and we worship, we sing and do all this stuff.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:55.920]   But I said, what if our worship this Sunday, one Sunday, is just to serve the community?
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.100]   So go to some places and pick up garbage.
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:02.820]   Go to some of these places where there are people who are marginalized.
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.740]   Serving them is our worship to God.
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:05.740]   What would it be like?
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.740]   This is just my dream.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:12.020]   What would it be like if all the churches, all the congregation in Hong Kong, united
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:16.940]   together as one church, and we declare the greatness of God, because God first loved
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:21.020]   us and that's why God loves you and we love you and we want to serve you.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.500]   Wow, that would be powerful.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:28.620]   If all the churches can come together as one church and we serve this great city.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.900]   That's my dream.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.380]   If it ever happens, then I probably, I'm about to die.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.380]   Okay.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:34.680]   So I'm ready to go.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.380]   If that could happen, that would be awesome.
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:41.140]   We serve the city all together with all the churches and we bless the community.
[00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.140]   I'm praying for that.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:43.940]   Network together to serve God.
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:47.900]   Let's exalt Jesus's name together.
[00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:48.900]   Let's exalt it.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.900]   It's all about him.
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:55.460]   Let's not make it about us, not make it about one church, but let's make it all about Jesus.
[00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.740]   Exalt his name together.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:00.900]   I want to close with this minute and a half video, a really short video.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.020]   I don't know how many of you know Jacob Collier.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:10.180]   He's a musician, an artist, and one of his concerts in Sydney, he invited Natalie Imbruglia.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.920]   I don't know if you know her, but she sang this famous song, "Torn."
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.100]   It's oldie, so some of you are like, "Oh, I don't know."
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:17.100]   Some of you guys were too oldie.
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.420]   You don't listen to any songs out there.
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.860]   Anyway, but she sang the song "Torn."
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:28.260]   And so I want to just kind of prep you before you watch this video.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:36.700]   The reason why this moment in history was so important and pretty significant was that
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:41.180]   the audience became a spontaneous choir.
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.300]   So there's probably some people who are very talented musically in the audience, and there
[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.580]   were some who are not very good.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:49.580]   Every time they open their mouth, we're like, "Where is that coming from?"
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.220]   There's those kind of situation, but praise God.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.940]   God is tone deaf, so he doesn't...
[00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.820]   Just sing from your heart, sing from your heart, like you're in the shower, so praise
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:58.820]   the Lord.
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:10.260]   But this concert, the audience became the choir, and then Jacob was the conductor leading
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:15.100]   the choir, and Natalie was just singing her song.
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:19.380]   And this is what I want you to notice as we close out with this video.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:23.020]   The first thing I want you to notice, it was spontaneous.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:27.820]   They were guided, but it was done out of just a spontaneity as they were singing.
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:32.900]   Second thing I want you to notice is everyone was involved and did their part.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:38.280]   Every person had a part in the song as they were singing different parts.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:44.340]   The third thing is everyone's eyes were fixed on Jacob, who was the conductor.
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:47.060]   Just watch, when you watch this video, look at people's eyes.
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.820]   They're all fixed.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:52.840]   Their eyes are fixed on the conductor.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:58.220]   The fourth thing is that the audience, they were directed and led by the conductor.
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:01.840]   Not only were they fixing their eyes, but they were listening to what this conductor
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.860]   was doing.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:12.180]   And lastly, watch the end when they celebrated, after they sang this song, this incredible
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.580]   and beautiful music that they made.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:18.580]   So let's watch this together.
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:31.580]   [music]
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:51.580]   [music]
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:48:11.580]   [music]
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:31.580]   [music]
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:51.580]   [music]
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:53.580]   Can I just ask us to stand?
[00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:54.580]   Can we stand together?
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:57.580]   You've been sitting there for a little bit there.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:02.580]   Wasn't that awesome?
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:03.580]   Amen.
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.580]   Who was the conductor for us?
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:08.580]   That's the Holy Spirit.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:16.580]   And as we fix our eyes on Jesus, and we all have a part to play, we're going to make some
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:22.580]   awesome music, a music that the world will hear and be drawn to.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:29.580]   They will know who Jesus is and that we are his disciples when we love one another in
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.580]   unity.
[00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:37.580]   May there never be Harvest Mission Community Church or Kung Fu Church International, even
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.580]   though names are important because you've got to call your children something, right?
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:42.580]   Hey, you.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:49.580]   But I pray that it will be the Church of Jesus because it's all about him.
[00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:54.580]   And I'm telling you right now, if the world can actually see it, all of us unified because
[00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:59.580]   we are one because of Jesus, they will be like, "How in the world?
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:03.580]   You guys are all so different, but you guys are one."
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:07.580]   That's when they're going to understand how much Jesus loves them.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:15.580]   I pray that we will not only pray for it, but we will fight for it to maintain the unity.
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:25.580]   And I'm looking forward in the future to networking together to win this city for Jesus Christ.
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.580]   Can I just pray for us?
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.580]   And then I'm going to hand it over, and I think the worship team will come and we'll
[00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:32.580]   sing a song, and then, sorry, we went a little bit long.
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.580]   We'll just dismiss you afterwards.
[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:35.580]   So let me just pray for us.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.580]   I'm going to ask us to do this.
[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:41.580]   And if you feel uncomfortable, please, you don't have to do it.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:47.580]   But if you're open to it, will you just grab onto someone's hand next to you as a sign of unity?
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:52.580]   If some of you are still afraid of the virus, you could lock elbows.
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.580]   You could lock elbows together.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.580]   Come on, let's join the middle together.
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:57.580]   Can we just do that?
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.580]   Let's just come together in one, unified.
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:02.580]   Yeah, let's join together.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:03.580]   Brothers and sisters, join the middle.
[00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:10.580]   Come on, slide over and just unite here.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.580]   Just holding hands doesn't unite us, you know that.
[00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:20.580]   But it's just a symbol of our hearts that we're united with this brother or this sister standing next to me.
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:27.580]   And I stand with you as a pastor from another church, but yet we're serving Jesus together.
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:39.580]   And whether you speak Cantonese or all the Chinese churches or all the international churches that speak English and all the other languages that are spoken on a given Sunday as they have their service,
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:52.580]   we are one church, one body, one faith, one Lord, one hope, one Father, one God, Father of all, through all, so that He will be exalted and glorified.
[00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:59.580]   Heavenly Father, thank you so much for the unity that we have in Jesus Christ.
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:00.580]   And Lord, it's not something we create.
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.580]   You've already given it to us.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.580]   And God, you're calling us to maintain it.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:11.580]   Maintain it through diligence and prayer to be united together.
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:23.580]   So, God, I do pray that there will be the sense of clarity in our calling of who we are so that we could be together, united in this unity.
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:28.580]   And Lord, I pray that there will be an ownership, that each one of us will do our part.
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:38.580]   We won't just hand it off to somebody else, but we will have the ownership to be united together through humility and prayer.
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:45.580]   We also pray that we'll understand more of this oneness that comes because of what you have done, Jesus.
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:50.580]   And Lord, we're praying for unity, that we will maintain it here in Hong Kong.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:53:00.580]   In the midst of all the division, in the midst of all the bickering and divisions in the congregation and even within the bigger body of Christ.
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.580]   Bring our hearts together for such a time as this.
[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.580]   This Kairos moment.
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:09.580]   Lord, we want to see this city transform for your glory.
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:11.580]   So, come and do your work.
[00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:12.580]   We trust you.
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:13.580]   We love you.
[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:16.580]   You are good and worthy of our praise.
[00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:18.580]   And it's in Jesus' mighty name we pray.
[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.580]   Amen.
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:20.580]   Amen.
[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.080]   Amen.
