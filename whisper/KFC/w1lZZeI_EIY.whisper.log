[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.840]   Good evening, everybody. How are you guys doing? How do you guys like my glass house?
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.320]   Do I look better over here? Do I look younger? Yeah? Okay. I should stand in front of it
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.920]   then. Welcome to the Esther series. We are finishing Esther. How have you guys liked
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.280]   the book of Esther so far? Yeah? JP's not convinced. We should cheer louder to convince
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.680]   him. Should we cheer a little bit louder? How have you liked Esther? Okay. Maybe somebody
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.920]   has to go through the book of Esther with JP again. Maybe he missed some things. But
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.800]   we're talking about for such a time as this, rest from our enemies. Rest from our enemies.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.720]   If it's your first time and you're just getting into Esther, let me give you a really quick
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:58.040]   recap. So the Jews have been threatened, right? There's this villain. His name is Haman, right?
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.920]   His name is Haman. He has some beef with a guy named Mordecai and he finds out Mordecai
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.360]   is actually Jewish, right? And these Jewish people haven't been really following, you
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.400]   know, worshiping the king or whatever that religious things that they do back then. And
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.880]   so he gets really mad and is like, yo, I want to not only destroy this guy, but his entire
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.480]   people, right? And so Mordecai is really afraid and he goes to the queen who happens to win
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.440]   a beauty pageant and becomes the queen and his name, her name is Esther, right? And Esther
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.800]   has this famous line that says, if I perish, I perish, right? Like Mordecai asks her, help
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.400]   our people, save our people. If I perish, I perish. And so she goes before the king
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.280]   and the king, you know, accepts her, right? Welcomes her in. And it is like that she has
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.760]   been placed there for such a time as this. And then Pastor John did a wonderful explanation
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.440]   of the feud between Haman and Mordecai last week, right? Mordecai and Haman. And he talked
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:12.360]   about the pride of Haman, the character of pride, the deadliness of pride and the cure
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.840]   of pride. And that is in Jesus. And so now we go to the climax of this story, the climax
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.080]   of this story. And so there was a first banquet and now Esther has set up a second banquet.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.200]   And so we continue to read chapter seven. So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther's
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.080]   banquet and as they were drinking wine the second day, the king asked, Queen Esther,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.360]   what is your petition? It will be given to you. What is your request? Up to half the
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.360]   kingdom, it will be granted. Then queen answered, the queen answered, if I have found favor
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.080]   with you, my majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my life. This is my petition and
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.200]   spare my people. This is my request. For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed,
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.720]   killed and annihilated. If we have been merely sold as male and female slaves, I would be,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.720]   I would keep quiet because such a distress would justify, would not justify disturbing
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.040]   the queen, the king. The king answered the queen, Esther, who is he? Who is he? The man
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:32.160]   who has dared to do such a thing? Esther said, an adversary, an enemy, this vile Haman. Then
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.840]   Haman was terrified before the king and queen. The king got up in rage, left with his wine
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.640]   and went out in the palace garden. But Haman, realizing that the king had already decided
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.680]   his fate, stayed behind to beg queen Esther for his life. The first thing we're going
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:03.560]   to talk about is rise, rise. Who rise? Who rises? Esther rises up to save the Jews. She
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.800]   was willing to put her life on the line. She had no idea what would happen, right? If you
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.720]   went into the presence of the king, right, without being requested, the king could have
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:25.040]   ordered that you be killed. And so we see here that Esther has courage and not only
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:32.400]   courage, but wisdom to know how to save her people. We're going to see in verse three,
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.480]   once again, the queen answered, if I have found favor with you, my majesty, and if it
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:46.760]   pleases you, grant me my life. This is my petition and spare my people. This is my request.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:56.440]   We see first that she has a premise. If I have found favor, if I have your favor. Firstly,
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.760]   the king chose her to be the queen out of this beauty pageant, he chose her. And the
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.160]   second thing is this queen, because she was chosen by the king, their reputation is tied
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:18.000]   together, right? The queen and the king, the reputation is tied together. And lastly, you
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.200]   have given me your heart, right? The king has married the queen. He has given him, given
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:35.920]   her his heart. And so that's the premise. If I have your favor, and then there's a petition
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.720]   and the petition is this, save my life. It is like an assault on the queen is an assault
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:51.920]   on the king, right? My people have been threatened. So you have also been threatened. We see such
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:59.200]   wisdom in this, right? Esther shows wisdom. She basically comes out of her closet and
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.440]   says, I am a Jew, right? She's announcing it to the king. She's taking a huge risk.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.520]   She might, she doesn't know exactly what's going to happen if she does this, right? Because
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:19.740]   who ordered the Jews to be, to be annihilated? Who ordered that? It was the king, right?
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.800]   Maybe the king would be like, no, that's my word. I'm a man of my word. My word is final.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:32.120]   And you, maybe, maybe the king could have felt betrayed, right? How, how come you've
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:40.360]   never told me this? And so it took courage and it took wisdom and Esther rose to the
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:49.080]   challenge to save her people. And so there was a dilemma between the king, all right?
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.380]   On one hand, she, she loved Esther. She liked Esther. She chose her to be king. It said
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:01.160]   that she found favor with her, you know, over all the other beauty pageants that were lining
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.200]   up. And then we also see that he sort of likes Haman, right? Like he's always around the
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.920]   courtyard. He asks Haman, what should I do for this man who has helped me? And then Haman
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.200]   gives him advice and the king follows his advice. The king likes both people, right?
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.960]   Have you ever been in a situation where you've really liked two people, maybe it's your wife
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:27.640]   and you know, and your friend, and then they have conflict. And then you're like, who do
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.240]   I choose? You know, pastor John comes to me all the time about this conflict. No, I'm
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.920]   joking. There's no conflict, Sandra. It's okay. It's all right. But sometimes there's
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.720]   a dilemma, right? You know, you have two best friends and they don't like each other. And
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.640]   it's kind of like an awkward silence, an awkward moment. And so the king could have been going
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.920]   through that, right? There's a little bit of a dilemma here. And then another thing
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.400]   is he didn't think about the consequences of his decree, right? He's the one who ordered
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:03.640]   it. He's the one who got it sort of got tricked into it, right? By Haman. And so on the other
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:11.400]   hand, the dilemma is I have made this decree. Wouldn't it look bad if I ordered something
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:17.600]   and taking it back? Right? It's like being at a restaurant and ordering something. And
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.320]   then 10 minutes later, Oh, I want something else. And you go to the waiter and Hong Kong
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.120]   waiters or they'll give you, you know, like, what do you mean you want something else?
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:34.440]   Right? Can you change the order? And she'll be like, and so let's see what happens here.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:40.040]   Let's see what happens here in verse six to seven. Then Haman was terrified before the
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:46.920]   king and queen, right? Esther just revealed that it was Haman who had done this against
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:53.840]   her and her people. The king got up in rage, left his wine and went out to the palace garden.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:59.640]   But what did Haman do? Haman realizing that the king had already decided his fate, stayed
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:08.000]   behind to beg queen Esther for his life. Just as the king returned to the palace garden
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.600]   to the banquet hall, Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was reclining and the
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:22.880]   king exclaimed, will he molest the queen while she is with me in her house, in the house?
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:27.880]   So it's so funny, right? Because what is Haman trying to do? Haman is begging for his life,
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.920]   right? Queen Esther, come on, man. I'm not that bad. You know, I'm just a regular guy.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.880]   You know, I'm not that bad. And then the king storms back in, you know, obviously wine is
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:44.460]   mentioned here because he loves wine. Right? And so he comes back and he sees Haman falling
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.960]   on the floor and Esther is sitting there and Haman there. And so he kind of assumes that
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:58.160]   he's assault, like ESV says assault. NIV says molest. Right? There was a rule actually back
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:05.920]   then that anybody, any man could not be in the presence of the King's Harlem alone. The
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:11.360]   queen and the queen or the King's Harlem alone. It was assumed that they were doing something
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:16.680]   they weren't supposed to do. Right? And so the king, when he came back and he saw this,
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:24.440]   it was like, what are you doing to my queen Esther? My queen Esther. And so what was the
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:33.400]   King's decision? The King's decision was to impale Haman on the same pole that he had
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:43.360]   set up for Mordecai. The same pole. Isn't that ironic? It's ironic. And we even, well,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:50.000]   some translation says it's a gallow, right? Hanging on a gallow. Others say it's a pole.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.920]   Some artifacts might say, it suggests it's something like this. Like it's a, if you see
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.200]   the next slide, it's a picture of, of these poles that people were impaled on. It doesn't
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:12.320]   look fun. Right? So I wouldn't try it. And so we saw the King's dilemma, the King's decision.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:18.880]   And now we see that the King comes up with a new decree, the King's decree and the King's
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:26.720]   edict granted the Jews in every city, the right to assemble and protect themselves to
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.800]   destroy, kill, annihilate the armed men of any nationality or province who might attack
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:39.160]   them or their women and children who plunder their property, the property of their enemies.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:45.080]   So Mordecai, Esther and the King came together and was like, what can we do to save the Jews?
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.400]   And the King came up with this new decree, new decree that the Jews are allowed to defend
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:12:02.560]   themselves. The Jews are allowed to defend themselves. And so the Jews are saved. Firstly,
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:09.360]   we see Esther rises up to save the Jews. She's the heroine with courage, with wisdom. She
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:18.440]   stands up for her people before the King. We see Mordecai also rise to honor and power.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:23.360]   Right? In the previous chapter last week, Pastor John was like, he was taken up on a
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:31.840]   horse and, and praised around the city in the King's robes or something like that. Mordecai
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:39.600]   was faithful to God. He would not bow down to Haman. He was faithful to God. He trusted
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:49.080]   that God would save his people. And we see later that Mordecai was honored to very high
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:57.520]   place of power in the kingdom. And next we also see that the Jews rose up in the kingdom
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:05.840]   of Persia. The Jews rose up to defend themselves. Thousands of them might've died in the defense
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:14.800]   of their own property and people. Not only do we see Esther, Mordecai and the Jews rise
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:23.440]   up, but we also know of one person that rose up for us and that is Jesus. The problem was
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:32.480]   sin. The problem was our selfishness and our hatred and our desire to go our own way. But
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:38.440]   Jesus saw the problem and he humbled himself from heaven, came down on earth to become
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:48.120]   flesh and he died on the cross for you and me. He rose up to this problem of sin that
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:57.240]   destroyed our relationship with God. And he rose from the dead to conquer death. And next
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:05.680]   we also need to rise up as Christians in the midst of this pandemic and the uncertainty
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:15.120]   in Hong Kong and the world. In the new Testament, I'm just going to summarize a little bit what
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:21.440]   Christians are supposed to be like. How do we rise up as Christians in the midst of this
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:25.960]   pandemic and uncertainty? We're called to be a new creation. For those who are in Christ
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:31.520]   Jesus, you're no longer the old, you are the new. You're a new creation. We're supposed
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:37.600]   to have a new identity in Christ. We're supposed to be transformed in our mind, the renewing
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.840]   of our mind as it says in Romans chapter two. Christians are supposed to be empowered by
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.600]   the Holy Spirit. We've been going through this in our summer college program, how the
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:55.240]   Holy Spirit allows us to love beyond our capacity, to experience joy, real peace as we resolve
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:03.840]   conflicts, have patience, show kindness and goodness, gentleness, and give us self-control.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:10.320]   Christians are supposed to preach the word in season and out of season, be prepared to
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:18.360]   give a response, to be the light and salt of our city. Imagine if these kind of Christians
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:24.200]   rose up in the midst of this pandemic, that they were the light and the salt, that they
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.440]   preached the good news. They encouraged those who are going through loneliness and hopelessness.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:37.680]   What kind of change would our city have if these people rose up? I bet you these people
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:44.440]   would make a difference in our city. These people that are called to be Christians in
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:54.440]   the New Testament, they would have a difference. And we've begun to make a difference, haven't
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:00.480]   we? The last couple of weeks we fasted and prayed for our city. Who fasted here? Raise
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   your hands. Yeah. Was it easy? Was it easy? No? JP says no. I fasted meat. It was a, it
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:21.160]   was an interesting experience for me. Yeah, I ate a lot of vegetables. We fasted and prayed
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:28.280]   for it. We fasted and prayed for our city. Not feasted. We'll feast later. But we fasted
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:35.240]   for our city. Why? Because we care about our city. We care about the things that are going
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:44.200]   on in this city. We wanted to rise up for our city, to pray for our city. And what else?
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:51.280]   We wanted to give masks. I know you guys love wearing your masks, right? Helps you breathe,
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:59.640]   but we weren't only giving out masks. There were many outreaches that we held in our church.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:05.600]   Bonnie and the team also held many, many outreaches. And not only were we giving it to the poor
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:13.440]   and needy, we were giving them the word of God. And we gave out, you know, passages that
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:24.560]   came with these masks. And so we see in the book of Esther, that Esther, Mordecai, the
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:36.400]   Jews, they all rose up. They all rose up. And after they rose up, there was also rest.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:47.080]   Rise and rest. You know, the Israelite people have always been in some sort of captivity,
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:57.520]   right? From Egypt, they were under captivity from Pharaoh for how many years? You guys
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:03.120]   remember? It was like 400 years or something like that. And then now they went to the promised
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:09.080]   land and they had to go through all this struggle against the other nations. And then what happened?
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   They were sinning against God. And so God sent them people to punish them, Assyrians.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:22.800]   And then the Babylonians came. They were always struggling. They were always fighting. They
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:30.680]   never had rest. It was like one thing after another. And so we're going to see here how
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:39.440]   Esther and the Jews had rest after they rose up. Mordecai recorded these events and he
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:46.320]   sent letters to all the Jews throughout all the provinces near and far to have them celebrate
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:53.560]   annually on the 14th and 15th days of the month of Adar as the time when the Jews got
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:19:02.040]   relief from their enemies. And as the month went, their sorrow turned into joy and their
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:09.840]   mourning into the day of celebration. He wrote them to observe these days of feasting. And
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:16.640]   this feast is actually still celebrated today. It's called Purim. The Jews actually still
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:25.200]   celebrate this to this day to remember how God had saved them from their enemies. So
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:32.560]   we're going to see that the Jews got rest. Esther and the Jews get rest. Jesus also gives
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:43.320]   us rest. And we finally need to find rest in Jesus. Esther and the Jews get rest, right?
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:51.840]   They celebrate Purim on the 14th and 15th day. It's a celebration. It's a feast. Wow.
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:59.920]   The Lord has saved us. Can you imagine what relief it could have been that the Jews were
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.440]   under this decree that they would be killed? And then now, yeah, now it's, it's been lifted.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.080]   Well, it's not been lifted, but there's a new decree saying that they could defend themselves.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:18.600]   What a relief it must've been that they could get rest from their enemies. There's been
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:28.440]   many heroes in the old Testament. Moses, right? Joshua. And as we go into the book of judges,
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:37.160]   we're going to see many heroes and heroines in the old Testament. But all these heroes
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:45.760]   and heroines are just temporary. They're temporary. The Jews were looking for a Messiah that would
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:55.840]   one day save them for all time, right? This Messiah would be their savior. They were looking
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:09.800]   for Jesus. Jesus is the one that ultimately came to save us from enmity, right? Tim Keller
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:17.560]   says Jesus saves us from enmity, which is hostility. The hostility we have between us
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:25.240]   and God. Read with me Romans chapter five, verse, verse eight to 10, one, two, three.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:32.040]   God demonstrates his love for us in this. While we were still sinners, Christ died for
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:39.120]   us. Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved through
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:46.680]   God's wrath through him? Verse 10, for if we were God's enemies, let's read together.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:53.080]   Verse 10, one, two, three. For if while we were still sinners, we were reconciled to
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:22:00.560]   him through the death of his son, how much more having been reconciled, shall we be saved
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:10.480]   through him? God demonstrates his love for us. How does he demonstrate it? That we were
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:22.320]   enemies of God. Enemies. God considered us enemies, sinners, right? We were enemies of
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:30.000]   God because of the sin that we had within us. God is perfect and our imperfection makes
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:40.960]   us enemies of God. But God wanted to reconcile that relationship. Amongst all things, he
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:47.240]   wanted to restore that relationship and he was willing to give what was most precious
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:55.000]   to him. And that was his son to die for us on the cross so that we could be saved and
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:08.320]   reunited to him. And lastly, since Jesus has provided us a way to fully have rest and peace
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:20.000]   with him, we also need to find rest in Jesus. Have you found rest in Jesus? Firstly, spiritually,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:28.400]   we need to find rest in Jesus. Many times we rely on ourselves to be good, to get ourselves
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:36.480]   into heaven. But Jesus says it is through him that he is the way, the truth, and the
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:45.560]   life. No one comes to the father except through him. Jesus has provided us salvation. Spiritually,
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:56.320]   we have rest. Physically, we have rest because we can look forward to the day of eternity
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:04.000]   where we spend time with God forever, where there's no more sin, where there's peace for
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:15.080]   all time, no more suffering. Emotionally, we have peace because the fruit of the spirit
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:21.600]   allows us to solve these conflicts that are in our lives. Emotionally, we can get peace
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:26.680]   knowing that we have peace first with God and now through the Holy Spirit, he empowers
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:37.800]   us to live lives of peace with others. Mentally, we can have peace knowing and rest knowing
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:45.600]   that we have purpose in him. He has given us a purpose and that is to have a relationship
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.160]   with him. We no longer have to struggle and try to find peace, find purpose on our own.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:25:00.960]   But God has given us a purpose to know him. Now, I've shared many times before that I'm
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:11.920]   a doer. I love going from adventure to adventure, from task to task, starting up new things.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:19.800]   And sometimes the problem with that is you start chasing. You're going from gadget to
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:27.560]   gadget, adventure to adventure, person to person, and you're just going on a rush. You're
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:35.600]   like a busybody and you're not finding real rest. And I'm chasing after all these things
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:44.920]   when the one person that's chasing after me is Jesus. And he wants a relationship with
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:54.960]   me. He's like, "Johnny, I just want to spend time with you. I want to know that I love
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:05.040]   you, that rest can be found in a relationship with me." Not chasing after these things
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:14.080]   or these people or these appointments, but rest comes from a relationship with Jesus
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:20.400]   Christ. And as we conclude, I'm just going to invite the band to come back up. I'm going
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:28.640]   to conclude with these two kinds of questions. And the first one is, will you rise in the
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:37.320]   power of the Holy Spirit to face the challenges that we have today that are in your life?
[00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:45.840]   It could be spiritual challenges. There could be doubts in your life. It could be physical
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:56.680]   challenges. Are you willing to go in the power of the Holy Spirit to rise up? Esther, Mordecai,
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:06.940]   the Jews back then faced challenges, the challenges of death. Today, we have our own challenges.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:15.660]   People that are against Christianity, those can be challenges. Are we willing, this pandemic
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:23.680]   is a challenge. Are we willing to rise up as Christians with the identity of Christ,
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:30.240]   the love of Christ empowered by the Holy Spirit to go out, to love people, encourage people,
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:37.920]   to share his good news? Are we willing to rise up? You know, during this pandemic, I've
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.320]   been able to text some of my friends all around the world. That's what technology has been
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:47.560]   so great. I can connect with people that I haven't talked to for a while and I can message
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:53.640]   them. And I remember, you know, just a couple months ago, as I was messaging one of my friends
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.960]   that I was really good friends with in high school and we haven't caught up for a while,
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   he was like, "Yeah, I really was encouraged when you invited me to our church summer camp.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:09.640]   That's the first time I learned how to pray." And he's a non-Christian. And he just told
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:17.840]   me that a couple months ago. We can rise up and make a difference for Jesus just by caring
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:27.080]   for the people around us, showing the love of God, telling them how God has changed us
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:37.880]   and how Jesus has brought us rest. And lastly, the last question is this, have you found
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:46.920]   rest in Jesus as your Lord and as your Savior? I'm going to invite you to just bow down your
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:29:02.640]   head and close your eyes. Have you found rest in Jesus? Or have you just been chasing things,
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:17.120]   jobs, people? Have you found rest in Jesus Christ? I'm going to especially challenge
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:25.120]   those who have not come to a relationship with Jesus Christ before. He's knocking on
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:33.160]   the door of your heart, just like he knocks at mine almost daily and says, "I want to
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.920]   spend time with you." Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart and he's saying he
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:47.200]   wants a relationship with you. For those who have not invited Jesus Christ into your life,
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:58.120]   I want to give you an opportunity to do that today, tonight. God is here. He died for you
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:10.520]   2,000 years ago on a cross. So this problem of enmity, hostility would be solved. Is there
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:21.080]   anybody out there tonight that wants to have rest in Jesus Christ? To enter a relationship
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:32.560]   with Jesus Christ for the first time? You can raise your hand. Jesus wants to have a
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:38.720]   relationship with you. Is there anybody out there? Just raise your hand and we would love
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:49.440]   to pray with you, pray for you. Is there anybody? Maybe you've been struggling. This pandemic
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:59.600]   has been hard on you. You've been feeling hopeless. There's fear. Jesus wants to give
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:18.600]   you rest and hope. Is there anybody out there that wants to ask Jesus into their life? Let's
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.320]   all stand and we'll respond in a song.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:22.900]   (gentle music)
