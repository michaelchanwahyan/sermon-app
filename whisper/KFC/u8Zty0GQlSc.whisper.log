[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Okay, good evening everybody.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.840]   Hope you're doing well at home, staying safe.
[00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.840]   And welcome to KFCI, our recording tonight for our sermon.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.720]   Before we begin, there's a couple of announcements.
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.280]   The first is we're collecting new face masks.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.640]   So if you have any spare face masks at home
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.240]   that you have too much of,
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.040]   please drop them off at reception.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.800]   And we would love to get your help
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.480]   as we wanna help the community around us.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.560]   Also, Pastor Paul and others are organizing an outreach
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.520]   to distribute these masks.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.280]   And if you are interested, please sign up
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.360]   and click the QR code, scan the QR code,
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.460]   and you'll have more information on that.
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.640]   And the next announcement is about giving.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.520]   So if you're interested in giving to the church,
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.280]   there's an FPS option,
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160]   and you can just follow the instructions
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.880]   on this slide for that.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.980]   And lastly, we wanna continue to promote the One Campaign.
[00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.260]   And it's a great app that you can download,
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.400]   and you can just follow us
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.760]   as we continue to read the word of God
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.580]   and as we lead it towards Easter.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.880]   So we're gonna pray, and we're gonna start today,
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.720]   and we're gonna continue in Ephesians.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.360]   Heavenly Father, may you bless us tonight
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.280]   as we dig into your word, speak to us,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.520]   fill us with your spirit.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.720]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.520]   So we're talking about Ephesians,
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.960]   and today we're talking about adopted,
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.880]   I am adopted and loved.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.840]   And last week, Pastor John did a great job
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.280]   of teaching us that we are new.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.560]   We are new in Christ.
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440]   Before we were fallen, right?
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.200]   We had a fallen nature.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.960]   We were religious.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.420]   We assumed that we were good enough.
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.220]   We worked very hard at social causes to help others
[00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.280]   to hopefully we can gain our way to become good.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.960]   We try to change ourselves through self-help insight.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.440]   And we also try hard at keeping rules, right?
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.500]   We're very religious.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.240]   We're trying to be good, trying to look good,
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.640]   trying to help others to become good,
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.960]   make ourselves feel better.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.880]   And then in Christ, so we were fallen before,
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.720]   but in Christ now we have justification for ourselves,
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.560]   for our sins.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.240]   We are now justified, right?
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.800]   We have regeneration.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.540]   We are made new in Christ.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.800]   We are a new creation.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.920]   The old has gone, the new has come.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   And everything that we do is pointing towards glorification
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.120]   and glorification, and that is to glorify God.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.240]   And so today we're talking about being adopted and loved,
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.760]   adopted and loved.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.880]   Throughout this book of Ephesians,
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.120]   there's this continuous theme
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.200]   that we are children of God, right?
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.120]   And we see that in Ephesians 1, verse four.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.240]   For he chose us in him before the creation of the world
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.020]   to be holy and blameless in his sight.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.020]   In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.800]   through Jesus Christ in accordance
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.620]   with his pleasure and will.
[00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.620]   In love he predestined us for adoption to sonship
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.020]   through Jesus Christ in accordance
[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.520]   with his pleasure and will.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.920]   Adoption is such a beautiful thing, right?
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.920]   You have a loving couple, you know, parents, right?
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.720]   And then there are children that may have been,
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.360]   you know, orphans or whatnot in different countries.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   And it's such an amazing thing of gathering broken people,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.680]   right, these children may have came up
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.120]   in broken families or situations,
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.400]   and they're brought into a loving family.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.200]   Adoption is such a beautiful picture.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:15.840]   But there is such a big problem of orphanism in the world.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.240]   In 2015, there were, according to one of the stats,
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.120]   140 million orphans in the world.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.160]   And that is, orphans, according to that stat,
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.860]   is one who has lost one parent.
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.000]   Double orphans are those who have lost both parents
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.520]   and make up 15.1 million.
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.800]   15.1 million, that's bigger than some
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.280]   of the countries in this world.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.420]   Orphanism is a huge problem.
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.460]   Fatherlessness is also a huge problem,
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.800]   and we see this through David Blankenhorn.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.120]   Tonight, about 40% of children in the Western world
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.240]   will go to sleep in homes in which
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.980]   their fathers do not live.
[00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.220]   Before they reach the age of 18,
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.400]   more than half of our nation's children
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.140]   are likely to spend at least a significant portion
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.840]   of their childhoods living apart from their fathers.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.600]   Never before in this country have so many children
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.420]   been voluntarily abandoned by their fathers.
[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.340]   Never before have so many children grown up
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.800]   without knowing what it means to have a father.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   Fatherlessness is the most harmful demographic trend
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.780]   in this generation, of this generation.
[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.620]   It is the leading cause of declining child
[00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.720]   and adult well-being in our society.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.040]   It is also the engine driving
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.560]   the most urgent social problems.
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.280]   If this trend continues, fatherlessness is likely
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.740]   to change the shape of our society.
[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.320]   Orphans.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.160]   Fatherlessness is one of the biggest problems
[00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.520]   in our modern day society.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.480]   And it was also a problem back then.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.160]   In fact, back then, in biblical times,
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.860]   only 50% of the children that were born
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.420]   grew up to 50 years old or more.
[00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.220]   And inficide was also a very big problem,
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.220]   especially for those who were disabled and girls.
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.980]   Inficide was a big problem.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.860]   However, Christians at that time started to adopt kids.
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.300]   They started to adopt kids,
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.140]   not to build up their family status
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.940]   or to continue their family line,
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.100]   but they wanted to adopt children
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.100]   because they realized that they too were adopted.
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.480]   And Paul speaks about this in Ephesians
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.700]   and the rest of his letters about adoption.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.180]   And we're gonna learn three things about adoption today,
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.260]   that in adoption, we have a new family,
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:21.240]   we have a new identity, and we have a new inheritance.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.280]   And the first thing we learn
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.240]   is that we have a new family, right?
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.540]   Adoption is a legal thing.
[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.460]   It's a legal thing.
[00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.620]   There's a change in name.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.540]   And it was initiated by the father,
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.260]   purchased through Jesus Christ.
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.500]   And we see this in Galatians 4, verse four to five,
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.340]   that when the set time had fully come,
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.540]   God sent his son, born of a woman,
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.640]   born under the law to redeem those under the law,
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:56.200]   that we might receive adoption to sonship.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.660]   God initiated it, right?
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.180]   He sent his son.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.740]   He sent his son to do what?
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.260]   To redeem us, to redeem those under the law.
[00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.620]   Under the law, we deserve punishment.
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.940]   But through Jesus Christ,
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.280]   we have received adoption to sonship.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.220]   And so we have a new family.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.020]   This new family was initiated through the father.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.700]   It comes through Jesus Christ.
[00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.520]   And now we have new brothers and sisters in Christ as well.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.020]   We have a new family.
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.620]   In adoption, we also have a new identity.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.840]   Before, we were rejected, right?
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.180]   We were sinners.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:49.500]   We were split apart from the Lord.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.980]   But now we are reborn.
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.980]   We are redeemed, and we are remade children in Christ.
[00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.280]   Before, in Romans, it talks about we were slaves to sin.
[00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:07.340]   But now we are free to be servants of righteousness.
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.480]   And in John 1, it says this,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.320]   yet to all who receive him,
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.240]   to those who believed in his name,
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.420]   he gave the right to become children of God,
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.000]   children not born of natural descent,
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.960]   nor of human decision or husband's will,
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.120]   but born of God.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.380]   If you have confessed Jesus to be the Lord and Savior
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.900]   and believed in his name,
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.900]   he has made you a child of God,
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.600]   a child of God.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.480]   So we have a new family.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.060]   We have a new identity.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:52.060]   We're no longer just ourselves, our old selves,
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:56.720]   but we are our new selves, which is in Christ.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.860]   We are Christians, followers of Christ,
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.260]   children of Christ.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.220]   We have a new identity.
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.620]   And lastly, we have a new inheritance.
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.860]   And it says this in Romans chapter eight.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.300]   For those who are led by the Spirit of God
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.180]   are the children of God.
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.740]   The Spirit you received does not make you slaves
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.700]   so that you live in fear again.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.740]   Rather, the Spirit received brought about your adoption
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.900]   to sonship, and by him we cry, "Ava, Father."
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:31.020]   The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.000]   that we are God's children.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.060]   Now, if we are children, then we are heirs,
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.740]   heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.940]   If indeed we share in his suffering,
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.560]   in order that we may also share in his glory.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:51.100]   If we are children, it says here, we are also heirs,
[00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.260]   heirs with God and co-heirs with Christ.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.540]   Isn't it amazing that we share in the inheritance
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.760]   with Christ?
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:08.040]   One day we'll share in this resurrected form,
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.740]   resurrected body, the new heaven and the new earth,
[00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.540]   all that time that we'll spend in heaven.
[00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.780]   Those are the things that we'll inherit with Christ,
[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.740]   this new heaven and new earth.
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.140]   And so the thing is, if we are children of God,
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.260]   if we are adopted into his family,
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.980]   and we have a new identity,
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:40.180]   we have a new family, a new identity,
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.600]   and we have a new inheritance,
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.020]   the question is, are we acting like sons
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.080]   and daughters of God?
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:53.080]   Are we acting like sons and daughters?
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   Being adopted children of God means transformation
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.680]   in our behavior, obeying our father,
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.160]   and living a life imitating Jesus.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:11.160]   And that is why Paul in chapter five of Ephesians says,
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.160]   therefore, be imitators of God as beloved children.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.720]   He tells us, be imitators, right?
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.720]   You're loved, you're children of God, so imitate God.
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:32.060]   Walk in his love, right, as Christ loved us
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.540]   and gave himself up for us.
[00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:39.200]   He also instructs us how to become sons and daughters
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.640]   in verse 15 to 17.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.080]   Look carefully how you walk, not as unwise,
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.360]   but as wise, making the best use of time.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.000]   As sons and daughters, we're to imitate God.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.160]   We're to walk in his love.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:02.180]   We're to make the best use of our time, to be wise.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.320]   He tells us also in verse 18,
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:09.080]   and do not get drunk with wine, which leads to debauchery.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.140]   Be filled with the Spirit.
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.720]   Adopted sons and daughters are filled with the Spirit.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.240]   Continuously filled with the Spirit.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:28.920]   Sons and daughters of God are imitators of God
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.800]   who walk in his love.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.860]   Now, the last couple weeks,
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.920]   we've been talking about Asian culture, right?
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:40.420]   And Pastor James did a really great talk
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.060]   on Chinese New Year about the differences
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.020]   between the Western and the Eastern societies.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.720]   You know, in Western society, they tell you,
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.900]   "Oh, I love you," right?
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.600]   "As a child, I love you."
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.560]   And in Eastern society, right,
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.840]   they give you an education, they give you food on the table,
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.380]   they give you those kind of things.
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.840]   And the problem with that is sometimes
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:14.400]   we get into this habit of trying to gain,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.160]   trying to gain respect,
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:26.020]   trying to continuously gain that favor, right?
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.880]   And I myself am like that.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.360]   I'm a doer.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.640]   And sometimes I get caught up in this thinking
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:40.600]   that the more I do, the more God will be pleased with me,
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.140]   the more my dad will be pleased with me,
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:49.720]   the more things I do, the more good I am, right?
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.220]   And John sort of talked about that last week, right?
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.040]   That our fallen nature, we're trying to be good,
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.600]   we're trying to live up to the social standards,
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.180]   we're trying to do this and that
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.920]   to make ourselves look good.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:08.160]   And the thing is, if we're adopted children,
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.720]   and we know that we are adopted children,
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.800]   we should be secure in our identity in Christ.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.960]   That we are adopted.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   We are children of God.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.540]   We don't need to go out there to gain our salvation,
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:28.420]   to gain God's favor.
[00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.060]   God already loves us.
[00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.320]   No matter how much more we do,
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.700]   God, it will not change how God loves us
[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.320]   or what he thinks about us.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.940]   And that's the thing, it's faith versus works.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.660]   Faith versus works.
[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:52.820]   We need to believe that we are children of God.
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.360]   Adopted children of God.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.660]   So, so that we're not just going out there
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.300]   trying to gain our salvation.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.900]   We're not serving in church just to be good enough
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.260]   so that God will help us.
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.540]   No, that's what's different about Christianity.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.940]   In all religions of the world,
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.960]   we have to depend on ourselves to do something
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.840]   so that the supreme being will be pleased
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.840]   so that we can gain ourselves into heaven.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   Only in Christianity has Christ already paid for everything.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.160]   And that now we have a new identity.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.080]   And so we're not trying to do things
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   to become sons and daughters of God.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.020]   We already are sons and daughters of God.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:46.860]   And so we don't come to worship here
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:52.740]   because, oh, I need to have good favor with God
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.600]   so that he'll love me and hopefully send me to heaven.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.540]   No, we are children of God.
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.980]   We are worshipers.
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.780]   That's what we do.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.480]   There's a change of mindset.
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.480]   And so instead of going out there and helping people
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.720]   because, oh, I need to gain favor and gain favor with God
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.680]   and hopefully he'll love me.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.000]   No, we go out there
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.200]   because we're adopted sons and daughters.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.520]   That's what we do.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.840]   We imitate God.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.040]   God goes out to help.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.580]   And so that's what we do.
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:30.960]   We're sons and daughters.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.000]   We are worshipers.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.900]   We are servants.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.640]   Right?
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.500]   We're not going out there
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:44.500]   just to gain favor of God and men.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.980]   But we go out there
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:53.520]   because we're servants and worshipers and imitators of God.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.780]   One of the best examples I've seen of this is Jeremy Lynn.
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.020]   Now he won his first championship with the Toronto Raptors,
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.460]   and I'm very proud to say.
[00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.340]   And do you know how much time he spent playing
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.360]   during the NBA finals?
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.060]   Not more than a minute, right?
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.980]   Something like that.
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.660]   Around, he played a minute,
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.900]   and yet he was considered a championship.
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.740]   And he was questioning himself.
[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.580]   He was like, "Am I really a champion?"
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.420]   Right?
[00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:29.100]   Like, I've only played like a minute or whatever
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.620]   of garbage time in the NBA finals.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.260]   And the NBA is such a place
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:42.680]   that looks at your stats, your performance.
[00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.100]   'Cause your performance is everything.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:46.940]   Right?
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.420]   If you're performing, then you get playing time,
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.460]   and you get playing time, then you get that contract,
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.320]   and then you get the recognition.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.700]   But Jeremy Lynn says this,
[00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:00.700]   "Even though I only played a million and a half
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.040]   "or whatever he played,
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.520]   "I'm still a champion.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.580]   "'Cause I practiced with the team.
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.040]   "I worked hard with the team.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.780]   "I was there all the time with the team.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.680]   "I was a part of the team."
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:20.980]   And it's such a great picture of God's grace, I think.
[00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:24.580]   That, you know, we...
[00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:32.240]   God's grace is that we actually didn't really do much,
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.360]   but yet God did everything to save us
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.000]   and adopt us into his family,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   and that we are champions because of what he has done.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.080]   What he has done.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.640]   And Jeremy Lynn does a really good job
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:54.760]   of going into his profession,
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:59.500]   believing that he is first a son and a daughter.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:02.040]   A son, not a daughter.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.600]   (laughs)
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.440]   Only a son.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.320]   He does a great job of that,
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.600]   'cause it's so easy to just get caught up
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.760]   in your performance, look at your own stats,
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.720]   look how much playing time you have,
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.540]   and be so discouraged.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:22.460]   And that off-season after he won the NBA championship,
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.640]   he said it's like the NBA has given up on him,
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.380]   and he had to go over to China to play.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:35.020]   And so, are we acting as sons and daughters?
[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:41.700]   Do you believe that you are a son and a daughter of God?
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:48.100]   'Cause if you do, you're gonna be different.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.820]   You're gonna act differently.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.900]   You're no longer slaves to sin,
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.220]   but you're now free to follow Jesus,
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.880]   imitate Jesus, to walk in his love.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.720]   To live as wise.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:08.440]   Are you acting like adopted sons and daughters?
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:15.120]   The second thing we're gonna look at is I am loved.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:16.340]   I am loved.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:21.440]   Now, everybody wants to be loved, right?
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.280]   Who doesn't wanna be loved?
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.640]   Everybody wants to be loved.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:28.000]   And there's this great picture here
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   of this girl, and she's trying to catch love, right?
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.220]   Trying to catch love.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:40.640]   And there's all these sorts of people in our society, right?
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.160]   You know them.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.560]   Sometimes we are them.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.920]   We're just trying to get love, right?
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.040]   And sometimes we go from relationship to relationship,
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.760]   or friendship to friendship.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.320]   We're just trying to feel loved.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.300]   Get that intimacy.
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:03.400]   Or people just like let people run over them, right?
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:06.240]   Because they wanna be loved by people,
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.680]   and so they just do whatever people tell them to do
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.080]   so that they feel loved.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:17.920]   And the problem with that is we're trying to fill our heart
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.840]   with love, with things that will never
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.620]   really truly satisfy.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:29.160]   And Pascal says this, "There is a God-shaped vacuum
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.000]   "in every heart."
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.500]   There's a God-shaped vacuum in every heart.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:39.100]   Agape love, many people say, is God's love.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.640]   It's divine, active, unconditional,
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.260]   self-sacrificing, thoughtful love.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.920]   That is agape love.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.880]   And we're gonna learn about Christ's love for the church
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.800]   in the rest of chapter five here.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   So read with me chapter five, verse 22.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.900]   "Wives, submit to your own husbands as to the Lord,
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.760]   "for the husband is the head of the wife,
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.000]   "even as Christ is the head of the church,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.360]   "his body of the church, his body,
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.420]   "and is himself its savior.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.580]   "Now as the church submits to Christ,
[00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.740]   "so also wives should submit in everything
[00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:27.700]   "to their husbands.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:31.380]   "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.680]   "and gave himself up for her,
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.760]   "that he might sanctify her,
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.500]   "having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.140]   "so that he might present the church to himself in splendor,
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:48.060]   "without spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:51.140]   "that she might be holy and without blemish.
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.480]   "In the same way, husbands should love their wives
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.300]   "as their own bodies.
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.640]   "He who loves his wife loves himself,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.740]   "for no one ever hated his own flesh,
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.400]   "but nourishes and cherishes it,
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.620]   "just as Christ does the church,
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.500]   "because we are members of his body.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:16.480]   "Therefore, a man should leave his father and mother,"
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.040]   not leave his wife,
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.700]   "Therefore, a man should leave his father and mother
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.960]   "and hold fast to his wife,
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.160]   "and the two shall become one flesh.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.080]   "This mystery is profound,
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.100]   "and I am saying this,
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.920]   "that it refers to Christ and the church.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:37.680]   "However, let each one of you love his wife as himself,
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.240]   "and let his wife see that she respects her husband."
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.880]   Right here in chapter five,
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.880]   we get a great imagery of what it means
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.460]   that Christ loves the church,
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:57.360]   and how a husband should love his wife.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.920]   And here are five ways that Jesus loved the church.
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.760]   And the first thing that we see
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:08.760]   is that Jesus loved the church as the head, as the head.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.380]   It said, right,
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.600]   "For the husband is the head of the wife,
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.840]   "even as Christ is the head of the church,
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.720]   "his body, and is himself its savior."
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.320]   What Jesus did was he took responsibility,
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:30.600]   took responsibility as the head of the church.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:37.520]   And because we are sinners,
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.520]   he took the responsibility of our sin upon himself.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.360]   And so the second thing we see
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.920]   is that Jesus is our savior, right?
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.920]   Jesus himself gave himself up to save us
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.160]   from the problem of sin.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.860]   And we see that in the next slide,
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:03.760]   that Christ is the gap, he's the bridge.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.000]   He died on the cross once and for all,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   so that this problem of sin would no longer be there,
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.580]   so that we could be reunited with our Father.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:19.040]   Christ is the giver.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.240]   He gave himself up.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.440]   He gave up his body for the church.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.680]   He gave it for us.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:33.740]   And next, we see that he is the sanctifier and cleanser,
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.560]   sanctifier and cleanser.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.360]   Jesus sanctifies us with his blood.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.960]   He washes us clean.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.960]   All right, he's trying to make us more and more like himself
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.560]   to become more and more like the Father.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.840]   He is also the nourisher and cherisher, right?
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.140]   Just like in verse 29, it says,
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.920]   "For no one ever hated his own flesh,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.760]   "but nourishes and cherishes it,"
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.240]   just as Christ does the church
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.120]   because we are members of his body.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.720]   Christ cherishes the church and nourishes the church.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   These are the five ways that Christ loves the church.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:29.760]   He's seeking for us to become more and more holy, right?
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.280]   He's nourishing us, sanctifying us,
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.000]   changing us so that we become more and more like him.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   So we repent of our sins.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.640]   We stop following the ways of our flesh,
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.800]   but now we are free to follow,
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.380]   follow Jesus.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:57.520]   And so how Christ loves the church is the same way
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:03.680]   how Paul says that husbands should love their wives.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.080]   Husbands should love their wives as Jesus loved the church.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.080]   Husbands should cherish their wives,
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:17.120]   love their wives,
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:24.080]   and wives should submit to their husbands
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.680]   as the church submits to Jesus.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.800]   Do you recognize how loved you are?
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.040]   You're so loved that God,
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   you're so loved that God took responsibility
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.920]   of the punishment that you and I deserve,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.680]   died on the cross for us, gave up his life for us.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.960]   He loves the church so much.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.960]   You are so loved because you are members of God's church.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.480]   And so the question is,
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.080]   are you acting like a loved son and daughter?
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.560]   Are you acting like a loved son and daughter?
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.320]   Or are you going out in the world,
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.040]   trying to fill your heart with things
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:24.640]   that will never satisfy, that will never satisfy?
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:30.760]   If you're acting like a loved son and daughter,
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:36.120]   you're no longer slaves to seeking love from all directions.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.640]   But now you know you're loved,
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.920]   and you can instead go out there
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   and be free to love others as Jesus loves them.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:57.320]   One of the youth, he grew up,
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.240]   he grew up with his parents
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   telling him about the 10 commandments
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:07.160]   every night almost, and God's judgment.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.360]   And so he has this mindset
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.320]   that he always deserves punishment,
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.000]   that God is a God of wrath, right?
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.720]   God will punish you.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.680]   And so he grew up like that in our church.
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:30.040]   And it was hard for him to recognize
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.400]   that God was a loving father.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:37.160]   There was this one time we went hiking actually,
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   and we were sitting together.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.840]   And he was like, "Johnny, I'm so mad at God.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.520]   "I'm so mad at God.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.360]   "I deserve punishment."
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:53.360]   And he even said, "If God wants to punish me so bad,
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.600]   "He can just strike me down right now."
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.560]   And I'm just like, "Yo, buddy, just relax, man.
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.080]   "God loves you."
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:06.160]   And we went through some scripture.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:10.680]   Actually, before, he only read the Old Testament
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.800]   'cause he was like, "Yeah, God is a God of wrath
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.400]   "and judgment."
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:18.480]   And so we started looking into the New Testament
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.240]   and who Jesus actually is.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.720]   And actually, in the Old Testament,
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.080]   it also talks about God is love, right?
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.200]   But he only chose to read those parts
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.440]   of condemnation and judgment.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:36.280]   And so as we started to look more and more
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.960]   through the New Testament and the Old Testament as well,
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.520]   to get a full picture of redemption,
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.160]   God's plan of redemption.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.200]   God softened his heart.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.280]   And God helped him to realize
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:59.720]   that he's not just a punishment, wrathful God,
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.920]   that he is also a loving God.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:07.260]   He's just and he's love at the same time.
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.840]   And so once he started to realize that,
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.480]   "Wow, God is love.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.100]   "God sent Jesus 'cause he loves us so much
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.020]   "to bring us back to him."
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:25.120]   Then he was able to start loving others.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:29.960]   Before he was also very quick to condemn and judge others.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.920]   Right, he was like, "Oh, these people are bad.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.780]   "They deserve to be punished."
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:39.480]   And he's so loving now.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:44.400]   In fact, he joined one of these non-Christian groups
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:48.700]   and he's trying to reach them.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.260]   He joined some non-Christian group
[00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:55.700]   and he's praying for them and getting to know them
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.100]   and really trying to share God's love with them.
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:01.980]   This is a story of a kid
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.740]   who didn't understand that he was loved.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.000]   And so he couldn't go out and love others.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.440]   That once he recognized that he was a loved son,
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.380]   he was able to go out and love others
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.380]   and share love of others, love of God to others.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.400]   And that's what we're doing here at this church as well
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.720]   through this outreach.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:32.040]   We wanna reach out to our community.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:37.340]   Those who don't have masks, we wanna supply it to them.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.980]   We wanna go out in the love of Christ.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.020]   And that's something that we can all join in.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.800]   We can all join in.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.160]   And so to conclude, here are some application points.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.160]   The first is, have you been adopted as a son and daughter?
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.840]   Have you been adopted as a son and daughter?
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:05.120]   Do you recognize that you are a child of God?
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.580]   If you haven't confessed Jesus to be the Lord
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.220]   and Savior of your life, you can do that.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.280]   You can do that tonight.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:20.160]   And ask Jesus into your life to be a Lord and Savior
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:22.580]   and to become a child of God.
[00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:28.680]   The second thing is, do you recognize the love of God?
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:34.600]   God loves you so much that he's willing to die for you.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:40.560]   God sent him to die on the cross for our sins,
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.580]   the punishment that we deserve.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:47.020]   Do you recognize how much God loves you?
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.740]   You are loved and you are adopted.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:55.660]   And if you are loved and adopted,
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:35:00.660]   are you acting like adopted, loved sons and daughters of God?
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:10.100]   You know, we're in a society right now with so much fear,
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.820]   fear of this virus that is going on.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:19.620]   But God did not give us a spirit of fear,
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:23.520]   he gave us a spirit of power, of love.
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:30.900]   Can we go out there and be his love?
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:34.080]   Share the hope of Jesus Christ.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.580]   People need the message of hope
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:40.400]   of the love of Jesus Christ more than ever.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:46.280]   In a time of fear, in time of hopelessness,
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.640]   can we be his light?
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:54.360]   Go out and shine forth, be a city on the hill.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.880]   And the fourth thing is, are we reaching out
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:35:59.920]   with the love of God?
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.000]   Are we reaching out with the love of God?
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.680]   How did Jesus reach out?
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:08.240]   He touched the leper.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.740]   He spent time with the tax collectors.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:15.780]   He had compassion upon those who are poor.
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.720]   Can we go out with the love of Christ?
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:23.360]   Because we know we are loved ourselves.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.160]   We're not out there to try and gain God's favor
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.920]   and gain, you know, make ourselves feel good.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.680]   No, we are already loved.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:33.120]   We are already loved children of God.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:39.560]   Can we go out there and be the hands and feet of Jesus?
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.700]   And I encourage you to join this outreach.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:47.120]   Pray for the people in our city
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:54.020]   that God would heal our city and help us.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.640]   So let's pray.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.720]   Heavenly Father, we thank you
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.760]   that through your word you remind us
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.800]   that we are adopted and that we are loved.
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   Help us to go out as your adopted sons and daughters
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.420]   to shine forth your light and your love
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.880]   to our city and to the rest of the world.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.520]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:29.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
