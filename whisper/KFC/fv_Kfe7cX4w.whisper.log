[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Good to see everyone.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.920]   So good to see you all.
[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.200]   Hope you're well.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.000]   I say hope you are well because I know that these few months have been anything but easy,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   right?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Anything but easy.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.080]   As John mentioned, we began the year January 1st.
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.720]   He preached a new thing, a new season.
[00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.520]   And then we were really excited actually to go into the series on emotional health, thinking,
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.560]   "Wow, this is a great topic.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.760]   It's a cool topic.
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.280]   It's a very trendy topic to talk about."
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.400]   But little did we know that we had to start that online.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.280]   And then 15 weeks later, and today the 16th week, we're back.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.760]   And we've been through the whole series on emotional health.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.040]   We went through all the 7 IMs.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.480]   And for some strange reason, other than God, we're back at emotional health again, and
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.240]   back with me sharing about it.
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.840]   But before I start, I just wanted to...
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.280]   I think everyone should give just a pat on your own backs, just to say, "Well done.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.640]   You made it through these few months."
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.640]   It's really something.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.760]   Actually, today I also wanted to just give a shout out to even just the pastoral team.
[00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.680]   It's something that I've really become more aware of in these recent months is actually
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.080]   for pastors and people who are in ministry, it's extra hard.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.200]   When we're there to care for people who have been placed in our care, our flock, but when
[00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.760]   things are getting hard to the point where you almost can't even care for yourself.
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.520]   And so I wanted just to give a shout out to even the pastoral team here, to Bonnie, for
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.400]   all the work that she's been doing online.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.080]   Just doing this stuff online is just...
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:48.520]   And of course, Pastor Michelle and Pastor John have gone through just a few months of
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.800]   just health or family issues and just all these challenges that no doubt all of us have
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   faced.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.640]   And just the fact that you guys are here, and especially John, just your leadership
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.360]   and just the season.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.360]   Thank you for that.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.320]   Of course, Johnny made it back.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.320]   He's alive.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.320]   He's real.
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.400]   I was beginning to think that he was a figment of my imagination.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.160]   But of course, Johnny, he had to really go through a really tough few months in Thailand
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:25.320]   where he was just swimming and he looks Thai right now.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.400]   But don't worry.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   Also thank you to you.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.920]   I was praying for you every day that the Lord would judge you for being away.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.720]   But seriously, I'll start really with a confession.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.960]   The title of today's topic...
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.040]   I'm just going to quickly just try to see if this remote works so I'm not caught off.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.080]   Brilliant, it does.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.920]   Emotional health in light of the incarnation.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.680]   John gave this topic and I'm just like, "Wow, what is this topic?
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.680]   Emotional health."
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.440]   And actually, I can confess to you, on the whole, I've been a fairly simple kind of guy.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.760]   Keep me fed, keep me happy, keep me exercising, give me some sunshine.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.760]   I'm okay.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.080]   But I'll tell you, these few months, I think they nearly broke me.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.240]   I think the burden of everything that went on these few months, waking up every day,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.840]   looking at the news, looking at people tear themselves apart or just go and tear other
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.560]   countries apart, I couldn't get over it.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.840]   If mental health is how you process your thoughts in your mind, emotional health is how you
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.360]   process your emotions.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.160]   And for the first time ever, I felt as though I was going through a tunnel that I've never
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.160]   really been through before.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.560]   I don't know if you felt this way.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.680]   Because not only has it been just over three months since we've been in person, it's coming
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.320]   up to the mark where it's been three years since all the unrest of the city started.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.440]   The city, this is really all I've ever known in Hong Kong in these last three and a half
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   years.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.800]   And someone was just sharing with me, "Oh, you know, in the summers, the barbecue pits
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.120]   by the beaches get really busy."
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.120]   And I'm like, "You know what?
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.400]   I don't think I've even been here when the barbecue pits have been open.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.440]   I don't think I've ever seen anyone in the barbecue pits.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.800]   I thought they were just for decoration."
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:10.080]   And I think to a certain degree, I think I found this challenging.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.400]   And so today I wanted to share with you really just what I went through and how really in
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   light of the incarnation, I managed to get through this.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.960]   Because there's a gap.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.880]   When you're talking about emotional health, for me, the issue was I can't process these
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.680]   emotions because it feels like there's a gap.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680]   Do you feel that?
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.360]   There's something missing.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.720]   Every day you wake up, you just can't seem to get a hold of.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.720]   It's funny.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.680]   We spent this afternoon, Christina and the kids, they were doing a jigsaw puzzle.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.000]   We got given two jigsaw puzzles over these last few months.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.040]   One was a basketball player, Steph Curry, and the other was a footballer, Lionel Messi.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.880]   And they spent the whole day doing the puzzle until...
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.600]   This is like every jigsaw puzzle person's worst nightmare.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.920]   You do it all apart from one piece.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.400]   And we couldn't find it.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   We still can't find it.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.240]   And we were looking around everywhere in the house.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.040]   And actually, I shared with them, actually, this was an example I was going to give because
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.440]   I think life is a jigsaw puzzle.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.440]   And actually, we're on this search.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.840]   Of course, these last few months, these last few years have been a puzzle for sure.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.720]   One that no one can ever seem to solve.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.720]   And yet we're all missing this piece.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.840]   We're all missing this piece, but we can't seem to find it.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.640]   And we definitely can't find it within ourselves.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.640]   That's for sure.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.840]   I don't know if you've spent any time searching into your own heart these last few months.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.200]   I have, and I can't find the answer there.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.800]   And then it's then when I started to realize that actually the answer isn't anything in
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.560]   this world.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   That gap.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.960]   Emotional health gets challenged when our expectations and our reality aren't matching.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.540]   We're hoping for this to happen.
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.480]   We're hoping for all these things and our plans to come to place, to pass, but yet they're
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480]   not happening.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.440]   And how does that make us feel?
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.440]   We struggle.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.880]   We struggle to process those emotions.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.800]   And then we try and scramble, we try and make the best of a bad situation, don't we?
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.080]   And then we end up just trying to fit pieces around.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.720]   We fit pieces around, but there's always that one...
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.400]   Do you remember that little childhood toy where it's kind of like that little puzzle
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.720]   where you shift things, it's like a grid, and the plastic pieces that you keep shifting
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.160]   to try and complete the picture.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.920]   But you've always got that one gap, because you need that gap to shift things, but there's
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.920]   always that one gap.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.320]   And I was beginning to feel the same.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.560]   And then I look at scripture and I see in Ecclesiastes 3 it says, "God plants eternity
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.600]   into the heart of man."
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.320]   And I was thinking, maybe that's the peace, that we're all created with this one little
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.440]   piece inside us that is missing, that only God can fulfill, eternity in the heart of
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.440]   man.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.360]   John 17 3, Jesus says, "May they know his prayer before he died.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.200]   May they have eternal life.
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   What is eternal life?
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   That they may know him."
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.160]   That is eternity, that we would know him and we're missing that piece.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.160]   A couple of weeks ago I shared a paraphrase of C.S. Lewis' quote, which is, "If nothing
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:04.440]   in this world can satisfy us, then maybe there's that one piece of us that nothing in this
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.160]   world can satisfy, maybe it's because we weren't made for this world, that there is something
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   else."
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.120]   And I see this, and I see John the Baptist, who amongst many other things, he was emotionally
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   healthy.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.100]   He said, "My joy is complete.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.280]   My jigsaw puzzle is complete."
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.760]   How did John the Baptist, this crazy man, get so emotionally healthy?
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.280]   Because his eyes were always on something else.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.400]   He would say, "Behold, the one who takes away the sin of the world.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.880]   I must decrease, he must increase."
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.160]   It's all about him.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.160]   When you look to somewhere else, beyond yourself, then you have a chance of finding that final
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.880]   missing piece.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.920]   But we spend so much of our times looking inwards.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:53.720]   I don't think we've ever been more narcissistic than we are now, and yet we are more sad,
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.400]   more depressed, suicidal than we've ever been.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.660]   Surely that tells us that looking within is not the answer.
[00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.480]   We have to look beyond.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.040]   We have to look up.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.560]   So emotional health in light of the incarnation is where we start to look at Jesus.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.960]   The incarnation is basically God becoming man, right?
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.680]   And we spend a lot of time looking at the divine element of Jesus, his divinity.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.280]   He is God after all.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.200]   But we forget that he is fully God, but also fully man.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.160]   Not half God, half man.
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.500]   Fully God, but fully man, human.
[00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.740]   He was born, he grew in stature and wisdom.
[00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.380]   He was hungry, he was thirsty, he was tired, he died.
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.240]   These are all very human traits.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.000]   And then I was thinking, well then, what is it about his humanity that can give us some
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.240]   insight into our emotional health?
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:00.800]   What is it about the incarnation that will allow us to see the way in getting healthy
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.800]   again?
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.120]   How to process our emotions in the right way?
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.200]   Jesus experienced all the same emotions and yet he was healthy.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   So how did he do that?
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   And so today that's what we're going to look at.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.000]   We're going to unpack what the incarnation is.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.800]   When I was reflecting and praying on this, there's only really two things I felt as though
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.600]   the incarnation was really showing us, at least specific to this topic.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.080]   And this is this.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.280]   Through the incarnation, I believe that Jesus was wanting to tell us, show us, that he knows.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.160]   He knows.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.760]   He knows what we're going through.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.120]   He knows our feelings.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.120]   He knows our angers.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.120]   He knows our anxieties.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   He knows our worries.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   Jesus knows.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.080]   That's the first thing I think the incarnation is showing us.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.400]   And the second thing, he wants us to know him.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:45.720]   So one, he knows us, and the second is that he wants us to know him.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.720]   Is that okay?
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.000]   I'm just going to unpack those two points.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.800]   So the first point really is this.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   Through the incarnation, we find out that Jesus is telling us that he knows us.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.080]   He's identifying with us so we can know that he knows.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.120]   God Almighty himself.
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.440]   From Genesis, "In the beginning was the Word."
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.040]   In the beginning of John.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.160]   In the beginning was the Word.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:22.960]   And then eventually, John 14, it says, "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among men."
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.120]   The creator of everything becomes a creature.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.960]   The creator of everything becomes a creature.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.920]   That word there, "Word," it actually means, is "logos," which means "eternal word."
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.800]   So this word that was there at the beginning, the eternal one, becomes temporal.
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.400]   The creator becomes a creature.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.560]   The eternal one becomes a temporal.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.400]   Pause.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.080]   Do we get that?
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:49.600]   That God himself became man.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.320]   I think we take that, I think I take that for granted sometimes.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.680]   "Oh, Jesus, he became a man."
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.000]   God himself became a man.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.480]   And many of you know I'm a Disney fan.
[00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.160]   And I'm just going straight to segue there really nicely.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.200]   One of my favorite films, I have many favorite films.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.720]   Never believe a pastor when they say, "This is my favorite Bible verse," because we have
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.720]   many.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.200]   And don't believe me when I say it's my favorite Disney film.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.120]   But one film is called "Brave."
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.160]   Has anyone watched "Brave?"
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.640]   Great film about a little ginger Scottish girl, Merida.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.640]   And she's having this argument.
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.600]   She just has a fractured relationship with her mum, and all she wants is her mum to see
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.480]   her perspective.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.400]   And then, of course, many things happen in the film.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.640]   And her mum turns into a bear.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.920]   Like human turns into a bear.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.040]   And then she ends up, and of course the whole story ends up, they reconcile because they
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.760]   gain a new perspective.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.400]   She knows, she understands.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.600]   Another one of my favorite Disney films of all time is completely underrated.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   It's called "Brother Bear."
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.560]   Has anyone seen "Brother Bear?"
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.480]   You see, that's a real disappointment because it really is low-key underrated.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.120]   Okay, actually, maybe I watched it many years ago.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.200]   But it is really quite good.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.400]   Again, the same.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.280]   This pack of hunters, this family of hunters, and one of the characters, Kenai, they're
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:03.560]   out in the woods hunting.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.000]   And then, unfortunately, one of their brothers gets killed.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.920]   And then Kenai is filled with just anger and wants to avenge the death of his brother and
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.400]   goes after this bear.
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.040]   Again, magical story happens.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:16.720]   Kenai himself turns into a bear.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.440]   And then he ends up befriending one of the bears.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.160]   And there she ends up killing this little bear's mother.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.400]   And it's, again, bear with me.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.720]   It's a crazy story.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:31.960]   But through that journey of stepping into some of the shoes, they got to experience
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.480]   and know that angle.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.920]   Now, of course, I'm not relating and associating God Almighty himself with a Disney film necessarily.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:48.640]   But it gives us a little glimpse that when he was God and became man, it allowed him
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.480]   an insight that actually really comforts us.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.840]   And that is that he knows.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.560]   That through the incarnation, we find out that Jesus himself knows.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   He knows.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:07.720]   Hebrews 2, verse 17 says this, "Therefore, he had to be made like his brothers in every
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.720]   respect."
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.280]   So God Almighty ends up becoming a human with all these human desires and all these human
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   needs.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.280]   He has to go to the toilet.
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.280]   He has to feed himself.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.280]   He has to sleep.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.800]   He was made like us in every respect.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:27.920]   Can you just imagine the humility that Jesus had to be willing to put himself through this?
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.480]   The creator signing up to be a creature.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:36.760]   The eternal one signing up to something that has a sell-by date.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.160]   That was the humility of Christ.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.120]   The Philippians, we see this.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.000]   In Philippians 2, he says, "Do nothing our selfish ambition will conceive.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.160]   In humility, consider others more significant than yourselves.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:52.600]   That each of you look not only to his own interest, but to the interest of others.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.120]   Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus."
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.560]   Jesus did this.
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.600]   He considered us more significant than themselves.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.000]   He looked at our interests, and he was the one that was God that became flesh so that
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.880]   he could identify with us.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.040]   Think of an adult who talks to a kid, an adult who loves children.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.720]   How do they talk to this child?
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.960]   They would scoop down, right?
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.400]   Sometimes even crouch down like this.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:22.360]   To get to the same level of the child, to show that child, "I see things from your perspective.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.160]   I care about what you see and what you're thinking."
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.080]   That's what God Almighty did for us.
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.040]   Through the incarnation, we find out that he knows.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.520]   And I hope that brings some comfort for you to start with today.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.200]   If you're someone just like me that has gone through struggles with emotional health, one
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   of the biggest challenges with emotional health is feelings that no one knows, right?
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.800]   That you're on your own.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.760]   Be encouraged then that Jesus had that same feeling.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.080]   Psalm 22 says, "God, why have you forsaken me?
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.160]   Why have you turned your back on me?
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.000]   Do you even know?"
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.200]   So the first thing I'd like to encourage you with is if you are going through challenges
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.400]   in your emotional health, and I truly believe all of us are to a certain level.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.880]   There is no way you get through these three years, at the very least, without some kind
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.760]   of trauma that is lying underneath.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:24.480]   And so if you are, the first thing that we can learn from the incarnation is Jesus knows.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.000]   But I don't know whether you know that he knows.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.800]   We treat him as such a distant God sometimes, right?
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.040]   Okay, final film reference.
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.640]   One of my favorite films of all time, serious, not joking, is Good Will Hunting.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.840]   Anyone watch Good Will Hunting?
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.960]   So good.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.240]   It shows your age, but so good.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.640]   It's about this genius called Will, who lots of trauma, lots of baggage.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.560]   And there's this one scene with Robin Williams, and it says, "Matt Damon is Will."
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:57.400]   And there's just one scene with Robin Williams, who's a psychology professor in a college,
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.400]   and he just counsels him.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:02.680]   And there's this one scene where, of course, the doctor sees all the struggle, and Will
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.740]   just kind of has this just very smart kind of like surface image that he has.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.080]   But then there's one bit where just the doctor just hones in and say, "Look, it's not your
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.760]   fault."
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.080]   And then Will's like, "I know, I know, I know, I know.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.080]   It's not my fault."
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.440]   He's like, "No, it's not your fault."
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.400]   And then he proceeds for the next few minutes just repeating that.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   It's not your fault, it's not your fault.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:29.680]   And it's a really touching scene, because finally he cracks Will in a good way, because
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.280]   he gets through to him.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:36.560]   But I think sometimes for us, we treat Jesus so far, he's just there, and he's God Almighty,
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.220]   he was on the cross, he died, oh, boo-hoo.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.120]   And then he rises again, woo-hoo, he rises again.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.040]   But we don't relate to him personally.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.920]   But through the incarnation, we see that Jesus is identifying with us.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.660]   He's crouching down to our level, and he's saying, "I know.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.720]   I know what you've been through.
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:58.880]   I know what you're going through.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.640]   I know what your worries are.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.080]   Cast your anxieties onto me, because I care for you.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.080]   I know.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.400]   I think like you in every respect, so I know."
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.520]   I think that's a powerful message.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:17.840]   I think that's the one that we need to constantly remind ourselves, that Jesus Christ himself,
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:18.840]   he knows.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.280]   And final verse here, you've heard me share this, it's one of, again, Hebrews 4:15, "For
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.640]   we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, because
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.520]   he knows, because he identifies with us."
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:35.200]   And I pray this next prayer very often, Psalm 139, "Search my heart, O God, test my thoughts,
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.920]   see if there's any offensive way in me."
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.000]   And I don't know if you pray this prayer.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.880]   It's a really helpful way for me to kind of just open myself up to the Lord and just surrender.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.840]   And I was praying this prayer in these few months.
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.400]   I was like, "God, there's something in me that's just not right.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   There's a piece that's missing.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.760]   I'm just struggling with all of this.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.400]   I'm waking up, and I'm just feeling I don't want to even get out of bed.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.480]   I don't know what this is.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.480]   What is it?
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.480]   Just search me, Lord.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.600]   Is there anything that is in me that is offensive?"
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.680]   And then I came across, well, I didn't come across, I suddenly was reminded of the beginning
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.440]   of this chapter that I thought, "Wait, wait a minute."
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:17.880]   So the end of the chapter is this verse, "Search me, O God."
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.760]   But the beginning is this, is, "O Lord, you have searched me and known me.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.520]   You know when I sit up and when I rise up.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.640]   You discern my thoughts."
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.280]   So that bit at the end seems a little bit strange.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.680]   Does it not?
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.240]   The whole Psalm 139 is, "Lord, you've seen me.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.240]   You searched me.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.240]   You know when I rise.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   You know when I go to sleep.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.240]   You know everything."
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.960]   And certainly at the end, you say, "Lord, search me."
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.640]   Wait, you already...
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.240]   But then there's a reminder that that little bit at the end has nothing to do with whether
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.880]   God knows or not.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.400]   It's to do with us.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.740]   It's to do with us surrendering to Him because He already knows.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:57.240]   Would we just admit that?
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.240]   Would we be open to that?
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.240]   Would we accept?
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.800]   Would we embrace it?
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:04.040]   So before I go on, I actually wanted just to pause even just for two minutes here and
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.160]   allow all of us just to spend a moment just to reflect on this.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.840]   So actually, if you would allow me to just lead you in this little bit, invite you just
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.040]   even just to close your eyes.
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.160]   Just for a moment, just for a couple minutes.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:23.280]   Don't worry, I'll still be here when you open your eyes.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:30.760]   I want to invite all of us just to reflect on the last few months, the last few years,
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:38.800]   even the last decade, whatever it may be for yourself.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:45.440]   Reflect over every battle that's happened in your own mind, with your own family, at
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.640]   work, in this city.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.440]   Reflect on every blessing that you've had, all the good things you've been trying so
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:20:02.760]   hard just to keep going, keep your head up, be strong for your family.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:13.200]   But do you know that Jesus knows?
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.240]   Have you been hurting secretly away from Him, thinking that actually He doesn't know, that
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.400]   maybe you're too embarrassed or ashamed of the things that you're going through in your
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:26.600]   own mind, but actually today the message for you is whatever you're going through, whatever
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:36.520]   grief that you are holding onto or experiencing, whatever trauma that you have experienced,
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.520]   Jesus knows.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:43.480]   And I want to just read that one 39 to you.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:49.680]   And I pray that the Holy Spirit would just allow that truth to wash over your heart.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.960]   Wash over how you feel about yourself.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:21:00.240]   Wash over how you're even feeling about this city.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:05.560]   Psalm 139, a Psalm of David.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:13.480]   "O Lord, you have searched me and known me.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:17.220]   You know when I sit down and when I rise up.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.880]   You discern my thoughts from afar.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.720]   You search out my path and my lying down.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.120]   And I'm acquainted with all my ways.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:33.320]   Even before a word is on my tongue, behold, O Lord, you know it all together.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:40.440]   You hem me in, behind and before, and lay your hand upon me.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.240]   Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   It is high.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.640]   I cannot attain it.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:49.320]   Where shall I go from your spirit?
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.520]   Or where shall I flee from your presence?
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.040]   If I ascend to heaven, you are there.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.800]   If I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:04.520]   If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there,
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.640]   your hand shall lead me and your right hand shall hold me.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:16.360]   If I say, 'Surely the darkness shall cover me and the light about me be night.'
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.440]   Even the darkness is not dark to you.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.720]   The night is bright as day.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.860]   For darkness is as light with you.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.320]   For you formed my inward parts.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:27.560]   You knitted me together in my mother's womb.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.800]   I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.840]   Wonderful are your works.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.520]   My soul knows it very well.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:37.960]   My frame was not hidden from you when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.000]   the depths of the earth.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.240]   Your eyes saw my unformed substance.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.800]   In your book were written every one of them, the days that were formed for me when as yet
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.040]   there was none of them.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.360]   How precious to me are your thoughts, O God.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.760]   How vast is the sum of them.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.800]   If I would count them, they are more than the sand.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:02.000]   I awake and I am still with you.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.280]   Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.320]   Try me and know my thoughts.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:15.680]   See if there be any grievous way in me and lead me in the way everlasting.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:19.240]   This is the word of the Lord.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.240]   Thank you everyone.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:26.200]   I encourage us to spend time allowing the truth of Scripture to wash over our minds
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.320]   and our hearts during a time like this.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.160]   Knowing that Jesus identified with us and He knows.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.480]   And if we would allow Him, if we would open ourselves up to Him, He would lead us to the
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.720]   way everlasting.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.720]   What is that way?
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.500]   What is that eternity?
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.500]   Knowing Him.
[00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   And here's the second point.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.520]   I've only got two today, so bear with me.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:53.840]   Not only does He identify with us to show us that He knows, the second is He also thinks
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.240]   that isn't enough.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.240]   Just because we get to know that, "Oh, God Almighty knows our troubles," that's not enough.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.960]   That won't help us solve our problems until we realise who He is.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.920]   So the second part of the incarnation is that He is revealing Himself to us so that we can
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.080]   know Him.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:16.400]   Because when we realise who He is, our problems suddenly get smaller.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:21.800]   And we realise how big He is, how mighty He is, and suddenly the challenges that we face,
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   they just shrink.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   They just get smaller.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:28.880]   In Mark 4, there's this scene where Jesus has done His teaching and then He says, "Guys,
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.520]   let's go to the other side of the lake."
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.520]   Do we know this?
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.720]   And then He said, "Let's go to the other side of the lake."
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.520]   But He's setting them up because He knows a storm is coming.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.080]   So they get into the lake and they go all in, the disciples who are obviously very good
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.720]   with boats, they're used to all this.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:48.360]   They get in the boat, Jesus takes a nap because He's about to show them something.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.960]   He's about to reveal Himself to them.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:50.960]   What happens?
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.560]   A big storm happens.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.920]   A big storm happens and then they're panicking.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:58.240]   People who usually know how to survive on the water suddenly are panicking.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.880]   They go to Him and say, "Teacher, what are you doing?
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.880]   Do you not care about us?
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.160]   We're going to die.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.160]   We are going to die.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.160]   Do you not care?"
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.920]   And so then He wakes up and then He says, "Peace, be still."
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:14.000]   He rebukes the wind and the waves and they just calm down completely.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.800]   What's that story about?
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.040]   What did Jesus, why did Jesus lead them into that lake to show them this?
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.960]   Was it just that, "Oh, Jesus, God Almighty will calm every one of your storms if you
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.640]   would come to Him."
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.680]   Is it that?
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.320]   Is it simply just, "Hey, we invite Jesus into our lives, into our boat.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.600]   He will be our genie that will zap away all the storms and He would just take them all
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.600]   away."
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.440]   That's not what that story was really about.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:43.520]   The story was simply to show, because if it was just to avoid storms, He could have just
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.520]   avoided not taking them to the lake.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   Right?
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.400]   That would have been a much easier way.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.680]   "Hey, there's going to be a storm there.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.040]   I know because of God.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.440]   So hey, let's go this way."
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.560]   No, that wasn't it.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.200]   So it wasn't just about the storm, getting them out of the storm.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.640]   What was it about then?
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:10.760]   It was about, "I am the one who can calm any storm, that I have the power to do this.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.000]   Just know me.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.720]   Keep your eyes on me rather than on the storm because I am bigger than any of those things."
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:22.000]   So on one hand, the incarnation just shows us humility, this gentleness about Jesus,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.040]   that He's willing to come down to our level.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:28.400]   But the second part of the incarnation is that He's revealing Himself to us in all His
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.120]   glory and through that we get to see who He is.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.480]   And once we realize who He is, our storms become nothing.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.640]   Does that make sense?
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.800]   That is what Jesus is doing.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:44.160]   And if we go back to those passages, that first one, oh, before that, Jesus we know
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.840]   here is God Himself.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.840]   He is the radiance of God.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.920]   He is the exact imprint of His nature.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.080]   He is God Himself.
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:55.240]   Colossians 1.15 says this, "He is the image of the invisible God."
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:27:00.880]   God, knowing that we mortal beings do not understand, cannot understand Him, gives us
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:01.880]   a visual aid.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.440]   He gives us Jesus Himself.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:07.000]   He says, "Hey, you're going to really struggle with this because my thoughts and my ways
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.120]   are so much higher than ours.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.120]   I'm invisible.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.120]   You don't get it.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.640]   Here's something that you do understand.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.800]   Here is a man.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.940]   You get that."
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:19.040]   And then He's actually God and He's revealing Himself.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   And what does it say?
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.520]   "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, but more."
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.720]   And now through this Word that became flesh, we have seen His glory, all the glory, and
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.880]   full of grace and truth.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.720]   So He's revealing Himself to us.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.640]   As He is coming and stepping down from heaven into earth, He's showing us that He is filled
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.720]   with grace and truth.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.000]   Of course, we know lots of descriptions of God in the Bible, right?
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.920]   Maybe my favourite is 1 Corinthians 13, which is read at many weddings, many funerals.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.720]   Love is patient, love is kind.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.560]   For me, that represents God because God is love.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:55.720]   So those are great traits of God that we see.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:01.560]   Yeah, and at least specifically in this passage, "The Word that became flesh dwelt among us
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.280]   so that we have seen His glory, filled with grace and truth."
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.240]   What do grace and truth really mean?
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.540]   We always hear the words grace and truth.
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.540]   What do they mean?
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:16.560]   Grace and truth in the Hebrew, in their original, the root of it really means unfailing love.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:22.520]   Grace means unfailing love and truth means this faithfulness.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.480]   Let's break down each word a little bit just so we know.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.720]   Of course, we hear grace all the time, it's this undeserved favour that we get from God, right?
[00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.120]   Grace sometimes is described as getting something that we don't deserve.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.840]   That's grace.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.560]   It's amazing.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.480]   So that's grace.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.680]   It is getting something that we don't deserve.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.000]   It's this favour that we get from the Lord.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.200]   And we see examples of Jesus giving grace everywhere in the Bible, wherever He's walking.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.840]   He goes to a wedding and He turns water into wine, that's grace.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:55.000]   When He sees a lame man, that lame man begins to walk.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.400]   A blind man gets to see.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.960]   A bleeding woman has her bleeding stopped.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:05.240]   That is all an example of God's grace because it's Him giving us something that we don't deserve.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:11.400]   So when Jesus is filled with grace, He's filled with compassion, He is slow to anger.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.240]   He needs you to know, He doesn't need you, He wants you to know this about Him.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.320]   As you struggle with your mental health, as you struggle with your emotional health,
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.160]   He is filled with grace and truth.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:25.200]   When you don't deserve it, when you are feeling the most low, He is right there.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.560]   He knows and He wants you to know Him, that He is filled with grace and truth.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.560]   Second word, truth.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.800]   The root of that word is reliability because truth is trust.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.000]   Can you trust in something?
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.440]   Is it reliable?
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.200]   Does it have your back?
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:48.200]   Jesus is filled with grace and truth because He has your back, you can rest assured.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:53.880]   You don't need to be anxious because when He says something, it happens.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.080]   We see that, right?
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:58.240]   There's some people who say, "Hey, I'll be there, I'll do that for you."
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.200]   And of course, they never come through, they won't do it for you.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.480]   But when God does it, He does it because you know the moment He says it, it happens.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.800]   Let there be light.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.000]   So God is good for His word.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.600]   He's a promise keeper.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.080]   He's a covenant keeper.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:21.440]   And He wants you to know that about Him, especially as you go through valleys, especially as you
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:27.760]   go through dark times, that He needs you to know that He has got your back.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.760]   That is even more important than us knowing that He knows what we're going through because
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.640]   we need to know who He is.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.280]   And He will allow storms to happen into your life.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.360]   He will allow these things to happen and He will continue.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:45.120]   And I don't think they're going to stop until He comes back.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.160]   But we as believers need to hold on to that, that Jesus, through His incarnation, revealed
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:55.520]   Himself to be filled with grace and truth, telling you that He has got your back.
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.720]   Psalm 23 has this just beautiful image.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:03.240]   "Lord is my shepherd, I lie beside still waters, and chilling and napping, I trust in Him."
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.080]   Verse 3, "And He leads me in paths of righteousness for His name's sake."
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   Don't really know what that means.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.680]   It just means He leads me on the right path.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.440]   It's so nice and it's all for Him.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.440]   That's verse 3.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.440]   What's verse 4?
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.360]   "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death."
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.160]   Wait, you just said that you're going to lead me down the right path and now you've led
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.600]   me down into the valley of the shadow of death.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:29.200]   "But I will not fear, for He is with me.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.440]   His righteousness staff, they comfort me."
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.880]   So Jesus allows us to go through storms.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.660]   Jesus allows us to go through the valleys of the shadow of death.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:41.400]   But He wants us to not only know what He knows about us, but that we need to know Him.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.800]   We need to cling on to Him.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:48.040]   That He is the one who's true and that He is the one who has our back.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.720]   And it's the same thing in the Hebrews verse.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.680]   Oh, I just did something.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.680]   Did I just do something?
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.680]   Huh?
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.680]   Wow.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   I think the Lord is telling me to finish up soon.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.680]   Okay.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.680]   Okay.
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   He's telling me that I need Him.
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.720]   Okay, I'm going to finish this very soon.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   Can we go back?
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:12.720]   Oh, no, no, stop, stop, stop.
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:13.720]   There.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.720]   Okay.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   Five, ten minutes, maybe, max.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.720]   Done.
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.720]   Okay.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:22.800]   So not only is He filled with grace and truth, this passage in Hebrews says, "Therefore,
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.960]   He had to make like His brothers in every way."
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.120]   So He knows who we are.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.560]   So He knows what we're going through.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.000]   He identifies, He feels, He sees, He sympathizes and empathizes.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.040]   So He might become a merciful and faithful high priest.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:40.200]   So not only is He filled with grace and truth, He's also merciful and faithful.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.320]   If grace is getting something that we don't deserve, mercy is the other side of that coin,
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.640]   which is holding back something that we do deserve.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.640]   Judgment, punishment.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.380]   He's showing us mercy.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:53.800]   We deserve that, but He's going to hold back.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:54.800]   He's going to show us mercy.
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   Got that?
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.600]   So grace is getting something that we don't deserve, all this favor.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.100]   Grace and mercy, two sides of the same coin.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.100]   What is that coin?
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.100]   Love.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:10.720]   And so through the incarnation, we get to see that Jesus is a merciful.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.320]   And again, faithful is the same as the word truth.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.320]   He's reliable.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.820]   He's good for it.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.320]   When He says it will happen, it will happen.
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.920]   When He says He's got your back, it will.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.680]   When He says He will be with you till the end of the age, He will be with you till the
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.240]   end of the age.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.760]   Sit tight because it's not going to be good.
[00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   Don't lose heart.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.080]   This world, you will have trouble.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.080]   Take heart.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.480]   But I will be with you and I've overcome the world.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.480]   He is good for it.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.140]   I don't know about you, but that helps me.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:42.460]   That helps me as I sit there wallowing in my own pity and everything.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:49.140]   I force my eyes back onto Jesus, seeing that He is the one that fulfills His promises,
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.380]   that this is not the end of the story, that cheesy quote, "Everything will be all right
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.940]   in the end, and if it's not all right, it's not the end."
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.340]   And I keep my eyes on that because He's good for it, because He's filled with grace and
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.340]   truth.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.340]   He's merciful and faithful.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.020]   But how do we know that?
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.260]   How do we know He's got our backs?
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.100]   How do we know that He is good for His word, other than of course that He spoke the universe
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.340]   into existence?
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:18.060]   We also know, because the final point which I'm going to squeeze in, I promised you two,
[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:23.380]   but really you're getting more than you paid for here, is not only does He identify with
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:27.220]   us, not only does He reveal Himself to us, we know that He can be relied on.
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.020]   We know that He can be trusted because He also suffered for us.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:34.740]   He suffered for us on our behalf so that we could be with Him.
[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:37.140]   And that is why we know He has our backs.
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:42.940]   That is why we know we can cling on to the very end, because He's the high priest.
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:47.340]   He's the merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God to make propitiation
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.180]   for the sins of the people, because He Himself has suffered when tempted, He's able to help
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.340]   those who are being tempted.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.260]   Just take you back a little bit to the Old Testament here.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:00.620]   The high priest in the Old Testament would be someone who stands between God and the
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:01.620]   people.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:06.580]   And basically knowing that people are messed up, that they always anger God because they're
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:12.380]   always doing stupid things, that the high priest's job was to offer regular sacrifices
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:19.260]   to appease the wrath of God, to basically reconcile, to be atoned for the sins.
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.020]   What does the word atonement mean?
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.300]   At one.
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:28.980]   It's reconciling so that two parties can be at one, reconciled together.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:31.820]   Does that make sense?
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.900]   And so that's what a high priest would do in the Old Testament, offer regular animal
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.400]   sacrifices so that God and His people can be at one, atoned.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.620]   But Jesus Himself now is the high priest in the New Testament.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.300]   He is merciful and faithful.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.780]   He knows everything you're going through because He's gone through it.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:49.180]   And He is now your high priest.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.540]   And instead of an animal sacrifice, He offers Himself.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:55.300]   And He suffered for us so that we could be with Him.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.580]   That is how we know He's got our backs.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.940]   Because He's been through the tunnel.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.980]   He's been through the tunnel and He's been forced to pick Himself or God.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.260]   He knows what it's like to have to pick Himself off the ground when He's sweating blood and
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:16.620]   look to God and still force Himself to say, "God, Your will be done, not mine."
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:22.260]   He knows, as the scripture says, Hebrews 4 says, "He's been tempted in every way."
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:28.620]   Now this isn't saying that Jesus has experienced every single temptation known to man.
[00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:33.300]   I don't know whether He's stood outside a KFC while He's been on a diet before where
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.380]   He's had to kind of restrain Himself from fried chicken.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:41.660]   He hasn't done, He hasn't faced every single sin, every single temptation.
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:44.860]   That's not what it's saying.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:50.660]   But what that means, what that phrase means is that it's representing, it's symbolising
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:57.100]   the unwavering firmness and faithfulness that Jesus had towards God.
[00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.360]   But what is sin?
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.360]   What is temptation?
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.500]   It's basically choosing anything but God, right?
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:09.780]   But Jesus went right to the very end and He got to choose Himself and save Himself or
[00:37:09.780 --> 00:37:12.300]   to obey the Father.
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:16.300]   And so when He has been tempted by everything, He has suffered and when He was tempted, that
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.500]   is what it was.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:24.540]   And in that moment, in that garden of Gethsemane, on that cross, He had a struggle, but then
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:27.380]   He chose God.
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.980]   With you and I in mind, He chose God.
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:36.980]   The last things He thought He'd say was, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.620]   do."
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:42.340]   That is why we know that He has got our backs.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:46.060]   That is why we know that whatever we're going through in our emotional health, whatever
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:51.140]   tunnel we're going through, however far the end of the tunnel looks, we can know that
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:58.340]   not only does He know, but His desire is for us to know Him and that He will be there at
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.220]   the very end.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.220]   That is it.
[00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:09.980]   Because of that, we get to draw near to the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:14.740]   That we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.220]   And He knows that we are in a time of need.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:22.860]   But whatever we're going through, we don't have a high priest who doesn't sympathise
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:25.260]   with our weaknesses.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:34.180]   How good are we at coming to Jesus, to His throne, with all our shame, with all our mistakes,
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:37.060]   with confidence?
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:42.940]   Because if we do, we will find the grace that we need and the mercy that we need.
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.860]   Why do we know that?
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:52.260]   Because He did what we couldn't do so that we could have what we could never have had.
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.100]   In Jesus, we gain everything.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.060]   We get to live life to the full.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:03.020]   We get to be healthy again.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:07.340]   And one day He will come back and He will transform our lowly body to be like His glorious
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.620]   body.
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:12.540]   But until then, there is a peace.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.540]   There is.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.620]   There's nothing we can do about it.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.620]   But let's cling on to the incarnation.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:23.300]   Let's cling on to what happened when the Word that was there at the beginning became flesh
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.580]   and dwelt among us.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:30.340]   What that shows us, what that affirms in us is what we're going through.
[00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.260]   And let us find that grace and mercy and help in our time of need.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:39.100]   Let us open ourselves up now as we worship in response.
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:44.540]   And let's declare, "Lord, I need you."
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:46.900]   Lord, I need you.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.900]   Let's pray.
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:49.900]   Lord, I need you.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.900]   Lord, I need you.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.900]   Lord, I need you.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.900]   Lord, I need you.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:57.900]   Lord, I need you.
[00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:59.900]   Lord, I need you.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.900]   Lord, I need you.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:12.700]   Jesus, we come before you now with confidence, well, with as much confidence as we can muster,
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.700]   to your throne of grace.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:31.700]   And we open up our hearts to you, where we know where we will be met with mercy.
[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:41.700]   We will find grace to help us in our time of need.
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:49.700]   Jesus, we thank you that you were the word that became flesh, that you dwelt among us,
[00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:54.700]   and that we get to see your glory filled with grace and truth.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:41:00.700]   We thank you that you know every single one of our challenges, that you know that we walk
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:06.700]   through a valley of the shadow of death, that we are in a storm even right now, even within
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.700]   ourselves.
[00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:13.700]   And yet you, Lord, are with us.
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:17.700]   You calm the storms.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:24.700]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort us, they bring comfort.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:34.700]   So I just want to spend a bit of time now just to pray for any of our brothers and sisters
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.700]   here.
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.700]   We've been struggling with emotional health.
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:51.700]   If that is you, I just invite you now just to open up your hands, just open up your heart,
[00:41:51.700 --> 00:42:07.700]   even just physically, just open up your palms and accept the invitation the Lord has when
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:16.700]   he says, "Come to me, all who are weary," recognizing that he knows, he knows what you're
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:21.700]   worried about.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:28.700]   He knows what the struggles are that you're facing.
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.700]   He knows that you don't know what tomorrow holds.
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:38.700]   But do you know that he holds tomorrow?
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:46.700]   Do you know that he still sits on his throne?
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:55.700]   Not any of the world leaders, Jesus sits on the throne.
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:00.700]   Do you know that?
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:13.700]   And that he is with you, that he is the light in your salvation, he is the stronghold of
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:21.700]   your life, that surely his goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life,
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:30.700]   even when you don't feel it.
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.700]   So would you turn your eyes to him?
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.700]   Would you look upon the goodness of the Lord?
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.700]   Would you wait for him?
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.700]   Would you be strong?
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:53.700]   Would you let your heart take courage and wait for him?
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:44:00.700]   And my God will supply every need of yours according to the riches of his glory in Christ
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:05.700]   Jesus, forever and ever.
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.700]   Amen.
