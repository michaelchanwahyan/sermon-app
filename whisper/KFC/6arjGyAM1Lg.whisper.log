[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.560]   Hope you guys are staying safe and you guys are doing well.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.440]   We're continuing our series called Mark My Word, Mark My Word.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.680]   And last week, Pastor John gave us an excellent introduction onto this book and really taught
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:29.660]   us about Mark himself and also how we should be prioritizing the voice of God over other
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.960]   people.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.920]   And so today, the word that we have chosen today is burst.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.240]   And so when you think of this word burst, I want you to type in the chat, what is the
[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.880]   first thing that comes to mind when you hear the word burst?
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.960]   What is the first thing?
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.600]   Type in the chat.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.000]   It's going to be an interactive bubbles.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.800]   Okay, you want to blow some bubbles, balloons, energy?
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.400]   Yeah, burst candies.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.400]   Oh, okay.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.760]   What is burst candies?
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.440]   Okay, anger.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.440]   Okay.
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.560]   Agnes has experienced some bursts of anger.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.560]   Okay.
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.520]   So these are some really good ones.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160]   Surprise is a good one.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.480]   Here is what comes to mind when I hear of burst.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.360]   You can see in the next slide, the first thing I think of is, well, do you know, have you
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.720]   guys watched Seinfeld?
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.800]   One of the best comedies of all time.
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.040]   It's Kramer, right?
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.560]   He just bursts through the door and just, he just sort of bangs into the door and burst
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.960]   it open at the same time.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960]   It's amazing.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.480]   One of the candies I really liked was Gushers.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.620]   They advertised it as when you ate it, the fruit juices within sort of burst it out.
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.360]   You see the sort of water, sort of the bursting of colors in their packaging.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240]   It sort of bursts out.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.280]   And then I don't know if you had a xiao long bao recently, but sometimes the xiao long
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.200]   bao, it just bursts, right?
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.400]   The greatest thing about the xiao long bao is that it keeps the moisture, the juicy,
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.040]   whatever pork dumpling juices inside, and then you eat it and it sort of bursts in your
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.320]   mouth.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.120]   And so we're talking about bursts today.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.880]   Jesus grew up and he sort of been quiet during his childhood.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.240]   And then it is during the 30th year of his life that he sort of bursts into scene.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.480]   He starts his ministry at the age of 30.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.960]   And so we're going to see some video clip from the One Series today on Jesus and how
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.200]   he burst onto the scene and started his ministry.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.040]   And so enjoy the video for the next couple of minutes.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.560]   After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.440]   "The time has come," he said.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.400]   "The kingdom of God has come near.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:10.480]   Repent and believe the good news."
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.300]   As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.760]   a net into the lake, where they were fishing.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:29.240]   "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people."
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.800]   At once they left their nets and followed him.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.480]   When he had gone a little farther, he saw James, son of Zebedee, and his brother John
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.640]   in a boat, preparing their nets.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.580]   Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.400]   hired men and followed him.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.000]   They went to Capernaum, and when the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.240]   to teach.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.000]   The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught them as one who had authority, not
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.420]   as the teachers of the Lord.
[00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.800]   Just then a man in their synagogue, who was possessed by an impure spirit, cried out,
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.920]   "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.760]   Have you come to destroy us?
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.880]   I know who you are, the Holy One of God."
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.760]   "Be quiet," said Jesus sternly.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.600]   "Come out of him."
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.000]   The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.440]   The people were all so amazed that they asked each other, "What is this?
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.600]   A new teaching?
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.640]   And with authority?
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.160]   He even gives orders to impure spirits, and they obey him."
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.320]   News about him spread quickly over the whole region of Galilee.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.280]   All right, that was an excellent clip, and I hope you've been enjoying the One series
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.840]   and following it as we come alongside Lent.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.720]   And so we're going to look at four aspects of how Jesus burst into the scene and he begun
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.280]   his ministry.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.320]   And the first thing we're going to see is he started to call on repentance.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.800]   And the next is calling, calling of the disciples.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:31.800]   The third is the authority he showed both in the synagogue and with the demon-possessed
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.800]   man.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.240]   And lastly, we're going to see how he burst into the scene and started healing people.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.000]   And so the first thing we saw earlier was that Mark said that Jesus went into Galilee
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.200]   and proclaimed the good news of the kingdom.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.920]   The time has come.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.240]   The kingdom of God is near.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.360]   And what he told the people was to repent and believe the good news.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.420]   Repent and believe the good news.
[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:05.100]   We see that Mark says here that Jesus' main mission was to do what?
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.840]   To proclaim the good news of God, right?
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.280]   Jesus came to bring a kingdom of love, right?
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.800]   Not subjugation.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.400]   He came to bring grace, not just be bound by the law.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:25.060]   He came in humility, not like a conquering king or a conquering Messiah.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.020]   He was for all the people, not just for the Jews.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.000]   And he was to be received voluntarily, not by force.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.960]   And so the people of Jerusalem and where they were, Galilee, were sort of surprised, right?
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.800]   They were like, "Oh, we were expecting a conquering Messiah to help us to overcome the Romans."
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.280]   But no, Jesus has come and he's calling people to repentance.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.240]   And he says here, "The time has come."
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.780]   The time has come, right?
[00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.600]   And what Jesus means is that there is an opportunity here.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.040]   There is an opportunity.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.980]   And the opportunity is for what?
[00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.480]   That the kingdom of heaven is near.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:15.000]   And he's not just speaking about heaven, that heaven is far away, but that heaven is actually
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   close at hand because Jesus is close at hand.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.160]   And Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life, and the way we can truly go to God.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:32.180]   And Jesus calls these people towards two important things.
[00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.320]   The first is repentance and then belief.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:41.380]   And now we've talked about repentance many times in our sermons before.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:48.400]   Repentance is I'm walking one way and then now I'm changing to go 180 degrees to walk
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.960]   to another.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.520]   Before I was walking in my own way, following my own desires, my own beliefs.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.700]   And now I'm changing 180 degrees to go God's way.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:05.720]   Another way to see it is going from one place to another, from one place to another.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:10.200]   So for example, maybe some of my friends from Toronto are asking me, as you can see in the
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.560]   next slide, "Come back to Toronto.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.040]   Come visit us in Toronto."
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.320]   And so in order for me to go to Toronto, what do I need to do?
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.360]   I need to physically leave Hong Kong, which is on the left side here.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.640]   Hong Kong is beautiful, as you can see.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:35.840]   I need to physically leave Hong Kong in order for me to go to Toronto.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   And that is what Jesus is calling these Jewish people to do.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.760]   He's like, "Come for the kingdom of heaven is near."
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.760]   You need to repent.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.440]   You need to leave your current situation, your current situation of selfishness, of
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.600]   sin, of your own beliefs and come to another, which is the kingdom of heaven, a place where
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.960]   it is a relationship with me and the Father.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:11.320]   And so the first thing that Jesus calls people to do is to go from one place to another.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:17.920]   And in order to go to the kingdom of heaven, they must leave their own situation, their
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.120]   own place to go towards God.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.800]   And the next thing that Jesus says is not just repent, but to believe.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:31.800]   And back then, possibly, Jesus is telling them to believe because they only believed
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.840]   in their mind, right?
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.720]   "Yes, I know that God is there.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.520]   Yes, I know that the law is true.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.160]   Yes, I know that the Messiah will come."
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.640]   But they did not truly believe these things in their hearts.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.520]   And many of us might be going through the same thing.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.920]   But yes, we grew up in the church, we know about Jesus, we know about God, we know about
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:02.160]   heaven, but do we truly believe Jesus in our own hearts?
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.840]   Do we truly have a relationship with Jesus?
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:12.040]   And so what Jesus is demanding from us here, as we see in the next slide, is a change of
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.040]   heart.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:23.200]   Jesus demands repentance, a change of heart, leaving our selfishness towards godliness,
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:32.040]   leaving our head knowledge to enter into a personal relationship with the Father.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.720]   And so Jesus bursts into the scene and talks about repentance and belief.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.280]   And then in the second video, that second part of the video, we saw, what we saw was
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:49.120]   Jesus coming alongside the disciples, the first disciples, Simon and Andrew.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.720]   And then also he found James and John, his brother, who are mending the nets.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.760]   And he told them to follow him, follow him, right?
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.640]   He would make them fishers of men, fishers of men.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.240]   So Jesus is calling them.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.500]   So here's the second discussion question.
[00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:17.920]   Have you ever, has God ever called you to do something or to change direction?
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:24.000]   You can type in the chat, has God ever called you to do something?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.840]   It might be to go to a new location, to a new job.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.680]   Has God called you to study seminary?
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.000]   I know Anthony is with us.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.160]   God has called you to leave your financial situation, to go into seminary.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.600]   I know God has sometimes called some of you to study certain things or to work in certain
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.880]   situations.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:55.440]   Type in the chat, has God ever called you to do something or a change of direction?
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:12:00.200]   Need a little bit more time to think about this one?
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.680]   To move to Hong Kong.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.240]   Okay, very good.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:09.680]   Yeah, George, you moved from your comforts of UK, your family and moved to Hong Kong.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.760]   Anthony, yeah, you shared in your baptism, you were called to Hong Kong.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.960]   Oh, sorry, no, this is a different Anthony.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   Sorry, this is Anthony Yau.
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.880]   Anthony was called from Boston to Hong Kong to KFC.
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.880]   Very good.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.720]   A career change by Michelle.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.720]   Very good.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.960]   I think that's Michelle.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.960]   Very good.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.400]   When I was 14 years old, I attended my dad's church and we had something called a summer
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.440]   camp and within the church summer camp, there was a dedication night.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:47.240]   There's three sort of hearts that you could just offer to the Lord.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.920]   The first was the dedication of becoming into a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:58.760]   The second heart was living for Christ every day, living in our work, in our school life,
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.260]   living for Christ.
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:06.480]   The third heart was, would you be willing to offer your life to serve the Lord full
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.480]   time?
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.160]   And I remember my dad was talking and pleading on behalf of the Lord.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.260]   God has given you everything.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.180]   What is your response?
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:19.300]   God is not saying, are you ready now?
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.800]   God is saying, are you willing?
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.620]   He will equip you.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:29.620]   And at the age of 14, I felt the Holy Spirit's calling.
[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.240]   I was moved to tears.
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.780]   I was very emotional.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:40.020]   I felt God had, Jesus had given up everything for me.
[00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.620]   My response is that I should give up everything for Him.
[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:51.560]   And so I walked into the center of the stage and I was like, yes, Lord, I'm willing to
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:58.500]   offer my life to serve you full time, wherever you call me, whether it's to be a missionary,
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.540]   whether it's to be a pastor.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.640]   And the rest is history, as they say.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.100]   And so we see here that Jesus burst onto the scene.
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.940]   He met these people who were fishermen, right?
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.600]   Who's been fishing lately?
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.900]   I don't think they can fit.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:20.140]   I don't think they enclosed the fishing, fishing, fishing.
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.740]   Lots of people are fishing nowadays.
[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:23.200]   I see that.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.340]   So what did Jesus do?
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:31.620]   Jesus chose ordinary people, fishermen, to do extraordinary things.
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:36.080]   These fishermen, they worked all day, all night.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.080]   It was hard work, hard labor.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.460]   You had to get your hands dirty and your hands were rough, right?
[00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:51.220]   You're pulling string, pulling rope, pulling up fish, mending the nets, pushing the boats.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.120]   It was tough work.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:15:02.600]   And yet Jesus chose these sort of uneducated, ordinary people to do extraordinary things.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.640]   It's interesting here.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:11.200]   Jesus said, "Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men."
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:18.960]   Jesus understood that there's a process of becoming, and Jesus would help them to become
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.880]   fishers of men.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.200]   Jesus equips those, he calls.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.360]   And Jesus is the ultimate fisher of men.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:36.520]   And it's great how Jesus connected with these fishermen and used the same language to connect
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.100]   with them.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.520]   And what did they do?
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.880]   They left at once, without delay, right?
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.640]   Imagine you're at work, you're doing finance.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.780]   Maybe Gabe is on call doing trading.
[00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.280]   Maybe Yan is doing marketing.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:00.000]   Maybe Kelly is in the future doing some cop thing.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.760]   And Jesus just calls you, "Are you willing to go?
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.760]   I need to make you become fishers of men.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.880]   Are you willing to go?
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.440]   Anthony, are you willing to go?
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.360]   Gabe, are you willing to leave your trade market stock place?
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.080]   Are you willing to go?"
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:20.220]   And we see the fishermen were willing to do that.
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.900]   It says they left at once without delay.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.780]   Maybe they just left their fish there.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.280]   Maybe they just left their boats there.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.440]   Jesus called them and they answered.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.440]   And so we see here, the second thing is Jesus demands priority.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.920]   Jesus demands priority.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:49.280]   When Jesus calls, Jesus demands our priority.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.520]   The first thing we saw was repentance, the calling for repentance.
[00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:57.520]   And Jesus demands a change of heart, calling us from one place to another.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.800]   And now Jesus calling us to become fishers of men.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.320]   He demands our priority.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:12.680]   The third thing we saw, the third scene we saw in the clip there was Jesus teaching at
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.680]   the synagogues.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:20.560]   Now, it wasn't uncommon during that time that sort of different teachers would sort of rotate
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.720]   and take turns to teach.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:28.240]   And so Jesus took a turn to teach at the synagogue.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:33.200]   And it says here that people were amazed at his teaching.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:40.620]   People were amazed at his teaching because he taught with one who had authority.
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:45.040]   And so I read some commentaries and some of them said, "Oh, back then rabbis didn't really
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:52.600]   preach as if these words were, they were really inspired by these words.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.240]   They sort of just quoted what other rabbis taught."
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:04.360]   And so the people were very amazed here that Jesus taught with one who was, who had authority.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.400]   And so obviously Jesus taught with authority because he is God, right?
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:16.360]   He knows the word of God and he is proclaiming the word of God.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:23.200]   And next we see the scene with the possessed man, the demon possessed man.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:28.280]   And so before we do that, let's go on to our next discussion question.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:37.160]   When was the first time you recognized the authority of someone or a governing system?
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:44.840]   So in your chat, when was the first time maybe you recognized, oh, your dad, you know, put
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.800]   his foot down and says, you can't do this.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.640]   Or maybe you went to school and then you got in trouble.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.320]   And so that was the first time you recognized that there was authority.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:03.120]   Is there, was there a first time that you recognized there was authority or a governing
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   system?
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.120]   Do you guys know?
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   What do you guys think?
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.280]   Type in the chat.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.640]   Any ideas?
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.640]   Any ideas?
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.280]   It's a hard question, right?
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.840]   Thinking about what was the first time I recognized authority or me.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.840]   Okay.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.840]   Parking ticket.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.840]   Okay.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.800]   You recognize, oh, this spot doesn't belong to me.
[00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:31.720]   I can't just park anywhere I want.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.800]   Mom and dad not letting me have candy.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:35.080]   That's a good one.
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.120]   I think it was me getting in trouble, right?
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.600]   At school, you know, for the first time.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:52.680]   When we recognize the authority or governing system of somebody, we sort of get shocked,
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.680]   right?
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:58.960]   There's sort of, yeah, teachers, when teachers tell us you, you know, have to do your homework
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.040]   or I'm going to talk to your parents.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.720]   At that time, you're like, oh, no, don't talk to my parents.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.640]   I don't want to be in trouble.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.760]   Right?
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.200]   That's sort of the first time.
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:14.240]   And so these people who are listening to Jesus at the synagogue, they were like, whoa, who
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.680]   is this guy?
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   Right?
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.560]   Maybe they saw Jesus before, right?
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.840]   Because Galilee is not that far from maybe his hometown.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:28.360]   They say, oh, I know Jesus before, but this is sort of the first time they see him speak
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   with authority.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.360]   Right?
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:34.080]   And we see other instances where Jesus went back to his hometown and they were like, who
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.480]   is this guy?
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.080]   Is this Jesus?
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.840]   Isn't this the man we grew up with?
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.680]   But now he's speaking with authority.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.440]   Wow.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.320]   And so when we recognize authority in our life, like that teacher, like that parking
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:54.520]   ticket, imagine these people in the synagogue for the first time listening to Jesus and
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:00.440]   he's preaching the word and the word of God hits them in their hearts.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.280]   And they're like, wow.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.280]   There's a grasp.
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.240]   The air is thin.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.240]   They take a breath.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.840]   And it's like, wow, who is this guy?
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.320]   Who is this guy?
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.880]   And then not only that, there's a demon possessed man, right?
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.800]   And Jesus speaks with authority and says, be quiet.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.000]   Come out of him.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.520]   Back then they may have had certain Jewish rituals, right?
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.480]   To take care of certain demon possessed people.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:38.000]   They may have locked them up or isolated them, but no, Jesus didn't need to do any of that.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.200]   He simply showed his authority.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.000]   He said, be quiet.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.660]   And the demons did exactly that.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.200]   He said, come out of him.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.480]   And the demons did exactly that.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.600]   And I remember a sermon I did earlier, right?
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.640]   That Jesus is greater than the spiritual realm.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.700]   Even demons obey him.
[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.880]   Even demons obey him.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:12.840]   He even gives orders to impure spirits and they obey him.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:17.280]   And so we see the authority of Jesus.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.040]   And lastly, we see the healing of Jesus.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.640]   The last passage we'll read is about the healing of Jesus.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:29.960]   And the first person he heals is he goes to the house of Simon and Andrew with James and
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.140]   John and Simon's mother-in-law was ill with a fever.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:41.400]   And immediately they told him about her and he came and took her by the hand and lifted
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:47.960]   her up and the fever left her and she began to serve them.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:57.480]   The first thing we see here is that Jesus meets personally with this woman who had fever.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.200]   Some commentaries say that when people had fever back then, they had sort of another
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.800]   ritual that they would sort of go through so that they could heal this fever.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:14.520]   But Jesus, showing his authority, he just took her by the hand and lifted her up and
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.280]   she was without the fever.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:23.920]   Once again, Jesus shows his authority over the physical realm, over the sicknesses of
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.720]   people.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:33.320]   And not only does Jesus heal personally in a personal context, Jesus goes on to heal
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.280]   in a public context.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:43.780]   He goes, "That evening, all who were sick and oppressed with demons, the whole city
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:50.160]   gathered together at the door," okay, "at the door of this house and he healed many
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.740]   who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons and he would not permit the
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:24:00.400]   demons to speak because they knew him."
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:09.820]   So not only does Jesus heal personally, but Jesus also healed publicly all sorts of diseases.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:16.480]   And so once again, we see here in the next slide that there's a healing in the public
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.380]   and in the private, all sorts of diseases.
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:27.220]   And Jesus shows control and authority in the physical realm.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:33.620]   And so through these four aspects, Jesus shows that he is superior, right?
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:38.220]   He bursts in the scene and he shows that he is superior over the law.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.220]   He is the one that has come to fill the law.
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.820]   "Repent and come for the kingdom of heaven is near."
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:48.580]   Jesus is superior over our hearts and our desires.
[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.500]   He is demanding that he be the priority.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.900]   Jesus shows that he is superior over the spiritual realm.
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.160]   He speaks to the demons to be quiet and they are quiet.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:03.500]   He calls them to come out and they come out.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.860]   Jesus shows that he is healing.
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:10.300]   He is superior over the physical realm.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.460]   Jesus is superior.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:20.100]   And so Jesus demands, as we see in the next slide, Jesus demands respect and obedience
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.500]   when he shows his authority, right?
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:30.080]   When we had that parking ticket, when we had that teacher that tells us to do our homework,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:37.240]   they demand respect and obedience or else there's consequences, right?
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:45.440]   And in healing, Jesus demands physical change, direct physical change.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:53.000]   And so not only did Jesus burst into the scene 2000 years ago and began his ministry and
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.040]   called people to repentance, calling people to become fishers of men, showing his authority
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:05.080]   over the spiritual realm, over his authority in the word of God, healing the hearts of
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.080]   people.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:13.080]   Jesus is also bursting into our hearts, into our lives.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:18.400]   Jesus demands a change of our hearts.
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.720]   Jesus is demanding a change of your heart.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:27.200]   Jesus is demanding a change of our priority.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.480]   He wants to become first in your life.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:38.720]   Jesus demands respect and obedience because he is authority.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:45.920]   He has the authority over the spiritual realm and he shows his authority in the word.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:50.000]   He demands our respect and our obedience.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.160]   And Jesus demands change.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:02.640]   He wants to heal us from our own sicknesses and the things that we can't change us.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:10.360]   That's why he sends the Holy Spirit to sanctify us, to change us when we cannot change ourselves.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:16.700]   And so here are some questions as we apply the word of God tonight.
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.840]   What is Jesus calling you to repent from?
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:26.040]   As we see in the next slide, what is Jesus calling you to repent from?
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.400]   To go to Toronto, I must leave Hong Kong.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:37.980]   In order to follow Jesus, is there something that I need to leave in order to go from one
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.120]   place to another?
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:50.180]   And I know that recently in our Christian leadership, there has been people that need
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:56.280]   to come from repentance, to go from one place to another.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:02.800]   And that has reflected on all of us to look into our own hearts.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:12.080]   It's so easy when we sin, it's a small thing, but it quickly becomes bigger and bigger
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:17.240]   to the point where we become comfortable with the lies we tell ourselves.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.800]   Oh, it's okay to watch this.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.680]   No, it's not hurting anybody.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:24.420]   Oh, it's okay to judge people here.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:29.040]   It's not hurting, as long as the other person doesn't hear it.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   Is Jesus calling us to go from one place to a godly place, to a place where we are selfish
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:47.000]   and sinful, to a godly place, the kingdom of heaven?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.920]   We each need to reflect on our own heart.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:54.620]   God is calling us to repentance.
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:29:00.720]   For those who have come for the first time, God is calling you to repentance, to change
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:06.120]   from your selfish desires, to walking your own way, to follow God's way.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.500]   And maybe you're here for the hundredth time.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:12.920]   God is convicting you and telling you, just like he told the Jewish people back then who
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:18.720]   knew of the word of God, repent for the kingdom of heaven is near.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.840]   Jesus is near now.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:29.280]   He's calling you to repentance, to a purified relationship with him.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:31.120]   None of us are perfect.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.700]   We all need to come before the Lord and repent.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.100]   And the next thing is, where is God calling you?
[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.300]   So my first calling was when I was 14.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:49.060]   The second calling I had was when I began university.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:54.520]   And I got in touch with this group who were starting to share the gospel on campus.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:30:00.040]   I remember going with one of the staff members and they started sharing the gospel on campus.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:01.520]   And they shared with this atheist.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.880]   And this atheist was like questioning everything about God.
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.680]   And he was so angry.
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:13.600]   And that night I felt such an urge, such a calling from God to help these people who
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.000]   didn't know God.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.520]   God gave me that passion.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.560]   God opened my eyes to these different people who didn't know him.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:26.240]   My third calling was when I was working in finance.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:28.080]   I was working in finance for two years.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.480]   I was, I just came out of university.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:36.480]   I was working for a small financial company that worked with all the major banks in Canada.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.960]   I was a 24 or 23 year old.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.840]   That was just a couple years ago.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:49.400]   So 23, 24 year old and you're walking around to all the major banks in Canada, talking
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:54.320]   with the CFOs, the bank managers, and the credit and risk department.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:31:00.400]   And I didn't know what I was doing half the time.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:07.680]   But you know, when I got into working, I realized that this really wasn't for me.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.880]   And that God continued to stir my heart, reminded me of his calling 14 years ago.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.440]   And I was at a crossroads.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:21.200]   Do I continue with my financial direction and go to study my CFA to become better in
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.560]   finance?
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.640]   Or do I go into ministry?
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:30.120]   And that time God closed the door for finance and opened this door to serve in a Christian
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.880]   organization to become a counselor at the university.
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:42.380]   And my fourth calling was with you guys, calling from Toronto to Hong Kong.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:52.800]   And I had to leave my family, my parents, my comfort, my sports team, the Toronto Raptors.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.320]   Fonny shaking his head.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.560]   Sports is very dear to me.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.080]   You know, John knows, right?
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:06.320]   You leave your hometown, your sports town, you come to Hong Kong where there's no sports.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.600]   And so I had to leave my family, my sports team, my friends.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:18.560]   And I've come here to help people in Hong Kong to know Jesus, to develop the next generation,
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:22.200]   to help the leaders of the next generation.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:28.720]   And it's been amazing to see how God has allowed us to work together as a team.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.760]   And so where is God calling you?
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.120]   Are you willing to place him as a priority?
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.120]   It takes sacrifice.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.120]   Yes, it does.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:43.640]   But in the end, it is worth it as we become fishers of men.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:49.940]   And do we recognize the authority of Jesus, just like these people who saw Jesus preach
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:56.480]   for the first time and were in awe as we read the word of God personally today?
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.720]   Are we in awe of the Lord every day as we look into his word?
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.960]   Wow, God, you are sovereign.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   God, you are in control.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:14.640]   As I go on the hikes and I go climbing and I see, wow, God, you know, every inch of this
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.200]   rock.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.680]   You know, every hole.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.900]   You know, every flat area of this rock.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.460]   You know, everything in nature.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:29.060]   And I'm in awe of his authority and superiority.
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.600]   Are we in awe of the Lord?
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:39.880]   And lastly, are you seeking to be healed and changed by Jesus?
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.220]   And as we are here in our physical bodies, yes, we are in sin.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.420]   You know, there is original sin.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:53.000]   And that is why the Holy Spirit has sent -- was sent so that he would sanctify us to become
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.400]   more like Jesus.
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:02.780]   Are we confessing our sins so that we become healed and become more like Jesus?
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:08.580]   Just recently, we were talking about mental health in our college program.
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:13.860]   And people were sharing how they were dealing with the different mental struggles, right?
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.740]   Questioning God, God, why did you do this?
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.420]   Why did you take away this person?
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.420]   And they were struggling to trust God.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.100]   And I encouraged them that, yes, these things happened.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.340]   But that God is still in control.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:35.900]   I was recently so struck by one of my former coworkers.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.340]   And we went on a mission trip together.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.060]   And he has four sons.
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.980]   And we went to Uganda together.
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:47.660]   And his son was, I think, five and then seven at that time.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.300]   And now his son was 11.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:57.860]   And I just saw on Facebook that his son was crossing the road to go to school.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:02.980]   And he got ran over by a truck.
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.580]   And I was so shocked because I was with him.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.900]   He was five and seven at this time.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.380]   And now he is with the Lord.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:21.340]   And I'm so touched to see my friend, who is the parents, to have to go through this.
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:26.260]   It's so tough to lose a child, 11-year-old child.
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:29.220]   And I was with him in two mission trips.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.500]   And I was still shocked.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:36.260]   And I was still taken aback by this and what had happened.
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:38.740]   He just died December 1st.
[00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:46.540]   But to see how these parents have come to the Lord and asked the Lord for healing, it
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:51.460]   has inspired me to do the same, to go to the Lord for healing.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:56.820]   And it inspires us that we also need to go to the Lord.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.220]   He heals not only publicly.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.940]   He heals personally.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.880]   God wants to heal you.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.900]   In his time and in his way.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.020]   And we need to trust that.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:19.460]   That God would heal you in his time and in his way.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:26.860]   And sometimes it might take the other side of eternity for us to be free, fully free
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:28.500]   and fully healed.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.700]   May the Lord bless you.
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:41.000]   May the Lord come into your life, burst into your life, so that you would recognize who
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.320]   he is, his authority.
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:47.240]   So that you would be healed.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.540]   So that you would make him the first priority of your life.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:37:00.280]   So that you would come and leave your direction to follow him.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:05.480]   We're going to sing a song and it's called I Surrender.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:11.240]   Let us surrender to the Lord as he comes into our lives.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:14.240]   Let him be first.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:19.440]   Let him be the authority of our life and let him heal us.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.560]   Lord I pray that you would bless everyone who is listening to this talk now.
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:30.240]   That Lord, you would help them to know you more.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.160]   To repent, to turn from their ways, to go from one place to another.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.720]   And that is to you.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.280]   A relationship with you.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.640]   Help them to surrender.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.840]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.360]   Amen.
