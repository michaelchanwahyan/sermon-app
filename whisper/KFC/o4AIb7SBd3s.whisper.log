[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.760]   - I tell you what, what a service to worship to him.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.880]   Amazing, I can't think of any place in the world
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.760]   I'd rather be tonight than to be here.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.840]   It was great to be in the presence of God.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.400]   Thank you so much.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.780]   But I wanna talk about the Corinthian church.
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.440]   The Corinthian church was a mess.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.040]   I spoke two weeks ago on the Apostle Paul's need
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.520]   to remind them of order in the church.
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.640]   The major issue was the use of spiritual gifts
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.840]   or should I say the misuse of spiritual gifts.
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.360]   Now Paul had quite a bit to say about this
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.840]   and I'm gonna attempt to cover it this evening.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.540]   My overriding verse and it applies to us tonight.
[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.560]   1 Corinthians 12 one.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.520]   Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers,
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.520]   that means brothers and sisters,
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.800]   I do not want you to be uninformed.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.680]   Other translations actually say
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.220]   I do not want you to be ignorant.
[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.060]   Now concerning spiritual gifts, KSCI,
[00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.020]   I do not want you to be uninformed or ignorant.
[00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.020]   Now the first thing I think I need to cover is this.
[00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.420]   What is a spiritual gift?
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.960]   Well, spiritual gifts are something
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.960]   that every believer is given when they receive salvation
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.400]   by faith through grace.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.080]   Just as the gift of salvation is by grace through faith,
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.540]   we can't earn it, so are the spiritual gifts.
[00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.680]   Our God is so generous.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.680]   He is constantly giving us things.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   The New Testament contains several lists of spiritual gifts
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.080]   but what you'll see in a moment
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.820]   is that most are in the Pauline epistles,
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.240]   the epistles written by Paul.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.120]   And while each list is unique, there is an overlap.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.200]   Have a look at the list on your screen.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.840]   Even this list is not exhaustive.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.880]   And spiritual gifts include natural gifts
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.280]   that are empowered by the Spirit.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.840]   And I'm gonna focus this evening
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   on the gifts that you see there in 1 Corinthians 12.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.760]   I wanna read that passage to you.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   I'm gonna start at verse four.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   Now there are varieties of gifts but the same Spirit.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:31.520]   And there are varieties of service but the same Lord.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.000]   And there are varieties of activities
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.180]   but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   To each, to each is given the manifestation
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.920]   of the Spirit for the common good.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.800]   For to one is given through the Spirit
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.520]   the utterance of wisdom and to another,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.320]   the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.400]   To another, faith by the same Spirit.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.600]   To another, gifts of healing by the same Spirit.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.480]   To another, the working of miracles.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.080]   To another, prophecy.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   To another, the ability to distinguish between spirits.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.240]   To another, various kinds of tongues.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.200]   And to another, the interpretation of tongues.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.720]   All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   Who apportions to each individually as He wills.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.920]   I wanna look at this passage pictorially
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.320]   and thanks to Bonnie here.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.200]   I've split this into three groups.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.680]   There are three gifts of revelation,
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.120]   namely wisdom, knowledge and discernment.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.120]   And each of these require us to say something.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.120]   There are three gifts of power, faith, miracles, healing,
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.160]   which require us to do something.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.040]   And thirdly, three gifts of inspiration,
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.400]   prophecy, tongues, interpretation of tongues,
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.080]   which require us to reveal something.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.040]   Now this is obviously not an exhaustive list.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.800]   In other lists, we've seen them already of the Spirit.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.920]   We see gifts of service, encouraging,
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.840]   contributing to the needs of others,
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.680]   leadership, showing mercy, evangelists, pastors,
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.920]   all kinds of gifts.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.840]   But the main point is that we, the church,
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.760]   the church, we need all of them.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:14.400]   And what Paul does, he uses the analogy of a body.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.360]   I love this.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.000]   He talks about the nose.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.600]   It says, I'm no more important than the eye.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   We need every different part of the body of Christ.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.320]   And some of these gifts more obviously demonstrate
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.040]   the unusual acts of God in this world.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.440]   For example, the gift of speaking in tongues or miracles.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:45.040]   But it also includes natural talents,
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.080]   which can be transformed by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.440]   We saw this earlier with our music group.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.200]   God is transforming their natural gifts
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.120]   into a spiritual gift.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.400]   The German theologian, JÃ¼rgen Moltmann,
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.360]   put it like this, I put it on the screen.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.360]   In principle, every human potentiality and capacity
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.920]   can become a gift of the Spirit through a person's call,
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:20.320]   if only, if only they are used in Christ.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.880]   The church.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.560]   The church is not meant to be a sort of one man show.
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.120]   Too often I've seen churches become like this.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.040]   The pastor does everything.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:43.360]   And some people are not doing anything.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.680]   Now we've got the World Cup at the moment.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.520]   I was very sad with that match last night,
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.960]   that England-USA, I have to say that.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.400]   But someone has likened the church
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.560]   to being like a kind of football match,
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.840]   in which you have 22,000 people
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.200]   desperately in need of exercise,
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.800]   watching 22 people desperately in need of a rest.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.240]   And the church can become like that,
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.080]   with the pastor doing everything.
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   One pastor received a letter.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.080]   Dear pastor, there are 566 people in our church.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.320]   100 are frail and elderly,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.840]   which leaves 466 to do all the work.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.160]   But 80 are young people at school or at college.
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.960]   That leaves 386 to do the work.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.800]   But 150 of those are tired business people.
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.920]   You recognise that?
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.960]   That leaves 236 to do all the work.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.080]   150 of these are busy with children,
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.280]   which leaves 86 to do all the work.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.960]   But 15 live too far away to come here regularly.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.880]   That leaves 71 to do all the work.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.640]   And 69 say they've already done their bit for the church.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.240]   And that leaves you and me.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.520]   But I'm exhausted, so good luck to you.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:29.680]   The church, the church, I'm looking at you now, guys.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.160]   The church is meant to be a place
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:38.160]   where every person's gift is exercised.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.880]   Because God has given gifts to all of his children.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.520]   But the major problem with the Corinthian church
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:55.520]   was actually in the misuse of the gift of tongues.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.680]   And I've seen this repeated in church history.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.840]   And tongues, rather than being a uniting thing,
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.080]   has actually been a potentially divisive issue.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.120]   In 2017, we did a teaching series at KFC.
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.080]   I was a lot younger then, look at that.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:25.640]   And we did a series called Tough Questions.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.640]   And I preached a sermon with a provocative title.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.880]   Do I have to speak in tongues to be a Christian?
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.520]   A provocative title.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.200]   The answer, however, was anything other than provocative.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.160]   The answer is no.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   Not all Christians speak in tongues.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.440]   It is not the mark of being a Christian.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.160]   Nor is it the mark of being filled with the Spirit.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.600]   You can be filled with the Spirit and not speak in tongues.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.120]   There's no such thing as a sort of first-class Christian,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.720]   a business-class Christian who speak in tongues,
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.640]   and a second-class and economy Christian who doesn't.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.040]   And it's not the most important gift.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.040]   St. Paul often puts it right at the bottom of his list.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.240]   So given the Corinthian dilemma,
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.240]   what exactly is the gift?
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.320]   Let me make it simple.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.960]   And let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 13.
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:36.520]   This is a passage which is often read at weddings.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   But I don't know whether people notice this opening verse.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.080]   1 Corinthians 13, verse one.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.320]   "If I speak in human or angelic tongues,
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.040]   "but have not love, I'm just a resounding gong
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.400]   "or a clanging cymbal."
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.920]   Paul says that there are about two types of tongues.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.240]   He says, firstly, all human,
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.120]   like speaking in tongues in a human language,
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.800]   and secondly, an angelic language.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.920]   Now more often, it's an angelic language,
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.160]   which presumably we wouldn't recognize.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.000]   So what exactly is it?
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.940]   Well, let's move forward.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:25.320]   1 Corinthians 14, verse two.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.160]   "For one who speaks in a tongue
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.940]   "speaks not to men,
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.280]   "but to God."
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.000]   And what do we call speaking to God?
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.840]   What is it?
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.160]   - Prayer. - Prayer, yeah.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.600]   And so it's a form of prayer.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.520]   It's a form of prayer
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.120]   that transcends the language limitation.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.320]   It can help us when we're praying for others.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.480]   It is not just a selfish thing,
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.960]   but sometimes praying for others is hard,
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.000]   particularly if we haven't seen them.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.820]   And God could give us this gift to pray.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:13.480]   I wanna take you back a few years.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:19.560]   There was a lovely Christian lady called Dora,
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.680]   and she had a very serious illness,
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.480]   and she was gonna die.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.600]   And I got a telephone call.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:34.760]   Can I go to Rutton G Hospital and pray for her?
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.760]   Because they're gonna be turning the machine off
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:39.600]   very shortly.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:46.560]   There's no words in English that I could use
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.600]   that would suffice.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.360]   I'm sorry, my canto definitely isn't up to pray.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.040]   And so as I'm in that taxi,
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.840]   waiting to go to Rutton G to pray for this lady
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.760]   whose machine would be turned off,
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   I had a language I could pray in
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.400]   which would help me do this
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.640]   without having to engage my brain.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:18.720]   But summarising 1 Corinthians 14,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.240]   what Paul was saying was this.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.920]   He was making a point.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.440]   Don't constantly be using this gift
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.480]   in every church service.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.840]   In other words, these people were so excited
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.960]   about the gift of tongues
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.320]   that instead of talking in a language they could understand,
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.560]   someone would get up and speak in tongues.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.440]   And Paul said this, I put it on the screen.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.760]   He said, "Look, this is hopeless.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:51.760]   "Better to speak in five intelligible words
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.520]   "than 10,000 words in a tongue."
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.680]   But he said, "Don't forbid it."
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.600]   Look at this.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   "So my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.560]   "and do not forbid speaking in tongues,
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:18.880]   "but all things should be done decently and in order."
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.360]   Remember I talked on that two weeks ago.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.760]   Decently and in order.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.400]   What he was saying is in public,
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.940]   there needs to be an interpretation.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.280]   That's not a translation, but someone needs to say,
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.760]   this is what I think that person
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.960]   was saying through that message.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.960]   But in private, he encourages the use.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:51.240]   In fact, he says, "I speak in tongues more than you all."
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.220]   Now the problem with the Corinthian church
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.720]   was that someone was getting up in church to preach
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.820]   and started to preach in tongues.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:09.560]   Now I've personally prayed privately in tongues daily,
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.840]   almost every day for the last 40 years.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.280]   I believe it's a gift potentially available
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.440]   to all Christians,
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.060]   whatever their denomination or background.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.980]   The Pope who's a Catholic,
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.040]   the Archbishop of Canterbury is an Anglican.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.440]   I understand both pray in tongues.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.960]   It is helpful when we don't know how to pray.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.000]   For example, someone with a serious or fatal illness
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.060]   or the example I gave you at Ruttengy.
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:44.840]   But if I get up here tonight
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:49.360]   and preach my heart out in tongues,
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.700]   it would be useless.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.440]   Laps up.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.980]   And I'd probably lose my job.
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:04.040]   But this was what was happening in Corinth
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:09.940]   and why Paul had to write at great length about the subject.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:15.660]   In these verses four through 11,
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.580]   Paul is simply showing that God works
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:22.580]   in many different ways.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.800]   And he works through his spirit.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:32.940]   We can also say that the spirit can manifest itself
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.900]   in many different ways.
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.420]   And that's why Paul lists so many here.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:40.380]   He lists wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, miracles,
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.780]   prophecy, determining the spirit's tongues,
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.140]   interpretation of tongues.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.740]   That's a pretty good list.
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:49.860]   But they're not just confined to these things.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.500]   There are people who have the gift of organisation,
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.280]   I'm not one of them.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.140]   People have a gift of management.
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.220]   There are people with musical talents.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.660]   There are people with gifts of literary talents.
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.700]   There are speaking talents.
[00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:08.500]   There are people who are able to serve.
[00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.340]   There are people who have compassion for others
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.340]   and they can make calls, write notes,
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.100]   spend time with the sick.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.940]   We can go on talking about ways that the spirit of God
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.380]   is manifested in various activities
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.480]   that people do to help one another.
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:31.660]   And it is not just in church services.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:35.180]   I think I need an amen for that one.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.500]   It's not just in doing the work of God.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:44.460]   It is in personal interactions with one another.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.260]   The gifts of the spirit are not limited.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:57.660]   Can we limit God on how he wants to give his spirit
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.100]   and empower a person to help?
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.400]   I don't think so.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.620]   That is the problem that Israel had.
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:13.580]   They tried to limit him and put him in a box.
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.860]   It does not work.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:26.340]   We'll take a closer look at verses seven through 11
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:31.300]   because there are a few things I need to point out here.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.300]   But I wanna give you a key verse first.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:40.300]   To each is given the manifestation of the spirit
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.940]   for the common good.
[00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:48.660]   Notice those words.
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:54.740]   Basically spiritual gifts are not for individual gain
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:55.920]   or for glory.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.540]   For they are for the profit of the whole congregation
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:03.900]   or the whole church,
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:06.160]   depending on God's will in the matter.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.660]   God has the right and discretion to use his powers
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.620]   in any way he wants.
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.420]   Perhaps someone at some point needs something
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.660]   or needs something said to them.
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:24.740]   God could then give that person his spirit
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.780]   and empower them to do that one thing.
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:29.980]   And it may never happen again.
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:36.820]   The gift is not for the profit of that particular giver,
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.340]   but for the person or persons who are receiving the help.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:44.860]   Of course, obviously it will bring glory to God himself.
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.540]   It will be for his profit.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:53.020]   And Paul before this time has already given us
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:58.020]   three indications that all the glory goes to God anyway.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:02.660]   At least twice he tells them that we should be working
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.740]   towards glorifying God in body and spirit.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.940]   He does this at the end of 1 Corinthians 1.
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.500]   And again, at the end of chapter six,
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.740]   he spends considerable time on his own example
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.820]   of preaching and living among them
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:21.240]   and why he did so in chapters four and nine.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:26.540]   Finally, in chapter 10, verse 31,
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:27.980]   I've put it on the screen.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:31.020]   He tells them that whatever you do,
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.580]   do it all to the glory of God.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.620]   My friends, that's the third time he mentions that.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:45.500]   Then at the beginning of chapter 11,
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:50.500]   he comes right out and tells them to imitate him
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:56.520]   as he imitates Christ.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:00.900]   He sets up these two major guidelines
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.580]   and they are the setting for the instructions
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.780]   in chapter 12 through 14.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.780]   He wanted them to understand two major points.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:14.180]   Firstly, everything we do is to the glory of God.
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.700]   I need to say that again.
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.580]   Everything we do is to give God the glory.
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.780]   And secondly, they were to fall back on Paul's example
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.140]   because Paul's example was a reflection
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.100]   of Jesus Christ's example working through him.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.180]   If we are gonna understand spiritual gifts,
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.580]   then we can rely on these two things,
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.580]   glorifying God in everything
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:49.420]   and following Christ's examples.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:55.660]   So then, what is there to feel proud about?
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.180]   This is what he's trying to tell them.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.380]   You are taking pride in something
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.980]   there is no reason to be proud of.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:11.740]   I've got a question to the church, the church.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.100]   Why do Christians wear spiritual gifts
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.020]   like medals on their chest?
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.800]   I've witnessed it time after time.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.500]   Verses eight to 10 are the various spiritual gifts
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.620]   that he mentions, wisdom, knowledge, faith, et cetera.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:33.300]   Paul may or may not have put these in somewhat
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.660]   of an order of value to the congregation.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:41.820]   And which ones does Paul put last?
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:43.540]   Maybe to bring home the point,
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.980]   he put last the speaking of tongues
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.820]   and the interpretation of tongues.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.740]   He is giving them an idea just where on the list
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.440]   this particular gifts belong, dead last.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.280]   Now I do not think, I do not read into this
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.920]   that Paul felt that they were not valuable.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:10.720]   But they were put last to make a point
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.200]   about how the Corinthians themselves
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.160]   were thinking about these gifts.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.040]   Nevertheless, it was still not something
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.360]   to get proud about and glory over.
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.320]   He tries to get them to understand
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.200]   that the things that they thought were really important
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.600]   were not as important as they thought they were.
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:35.560]   You could say that even though they are not unimportant,
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.320]   he makes the point of showing them
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:42.120]   to be of lesser importance.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.640]   Verse 11, I'm gonna put it on the screen,
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.800]   is a concluding statement.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.760]   He says, "All of these are the work of one
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.740]   "and the same Spirit."
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.720]   And he distributes them to each one
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   or portions them to each one just as he desires,
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.360]   as he determines.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.720]   And this summarises the main point.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.080]   His main point is this,
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.680]   all spiritual gifts are empowered by the same Holy Spirit
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:21.280]   and God the Father himself determines who gets what.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.040]   Let's read.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.740]   For just as the body is one and has many members
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.240]   and all the members of the body,
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.320]   though many are one body,
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.220]   so it is for Christ.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:42.840]   For in one Spirit, we were all baptised into one body,
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.680]   Jews and Greeks, slaves and free,
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.880]   and we're all made to drink of the one Spirit.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:53.840]   For the body does not consist of one member,
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.820]   but of many.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.320]   If the foot should say,
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.280]   "Because I'm not a hand, I don't belong to the body."
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.160]   That would not make it any lesser part of the body.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.760]   If the ear should say,
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.520]   "Because I'm not an eye, I don't belong to the body."
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.480]   That would not make it less any part of the body.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.720]   If the whole body were an eye,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.280]   where would be the sense of hearing?
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.820]   If the whole body were an ear,
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.440]   where would be the sense of smell?
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.760]   But as it is, God arranged the members in the body,
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.000]   every one of them, each one of them as He chose.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.140]   If all were a single member, where would the body be?
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:40.760]   As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:46.900]   The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you."
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.200]   Nor the head say to the feet, "I have no need of you."
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.320]   On the contrary, the parts of the body
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.720]   that seem to be weaker are indispensable.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.960]   And on those parts of the body that we think less honourable,
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.080]   we just bestow the greater honour.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:07.900]   And our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.240]   which makes our more presentable parts,
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.640]   which our more presentable parts do not require.
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.480]   But God has so composed the body,
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.840]   giving greater honour to the part that lacked it.
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.220]   So there may be no division in the body,
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.280]   but the members will have the same care for one another.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:30.720]   If one member suffers, all suffer together.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.980]   If one member is honoured, all rejoice together.
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.600]   Now you are the body of Christ
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.840]   and individually members of it.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.640]   And God has appointed in the church,
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.360]   first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers,
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.920]   then miracles, then gifts of healing,
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.520]   helping, administration and various kinds of tongues.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.320]   Are we all apostles? No.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.920]   Are we all prophets?
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.720]   Are we all teachers? Do we all work miracles?
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.560]   Do we all possess gifts of healing?
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.640]   Do all speak in tongues?
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.080]   Do all interpret?
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:12.960]   But earnestly desire the higher gifts
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.780]   and I will show you the most excellent way.
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.620]   I wanna come back to that last verse.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:26.460]   We wanna conclude that after reading this whole chapter,
[00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.340]   Paul had to change their entire way of thinking
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.060]   about such spiritual gifts.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.540]   They were coming at it from an extreme,
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:39.220]   carnal, individualistic perspective.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.460]   They were thinking, wow, God has given me this thing.
[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.180]   They were focused on themselves.
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.700]   They were focused on what they could get from this,
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.660]   how far they could climb the ladder, what's in it for me?
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.020]   How can I make myself look good in church?
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.740]   What will propel me to the head of the class?
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:03.220]   What is the one gift that God, that will make me shine?
[00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:08.220]   It's all I, I, I and me, me, me.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:12.580]   And Paul had the difficult problem
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:16.020]   of wrestling their attention off of themselves
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.260]   and trying to make them start thinking as a body,
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.180]   a unified body of Christ,
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.100]   a community separate from the world.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:27.660]   He acknowledges several times in the chapter
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.940]   that we retain our individuality.
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.380]   He talks about members being individuals.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.820]   There are many members in one body.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:41.220]   The body is composed of many members,
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:46.220]   but there is a delicate balance between one's individuality
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:51.260]   and one's place in the body of Christ.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:56.780]   We are part of the whole.
[00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.820]   What he's trying to do is to get them
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:05.420]   to shift their focus of care from inward to outward.
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.100]   All they cared about was themselves
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.300]   and what they could get.
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.500]   But by going at it from this direction,
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.540]   he is trying to get them to shift the importance
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.140]   of these gifts from how it will benefit them
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.660]   to how it will benefit everyone.
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:27.380]   And that's what I mean by shifting the focus
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:30.100]   of care from inward to outward.
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.940]   Let's look at how the chapter finished.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:37.540]   I love this, 31.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:53.740]   What follows this?
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.060]   Paul moves on to the chapter about love.
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.220]   1 Corinthians 13.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:05.220]   Now, the original manuscripts that made up the Bible
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:09.060]   did not have chapter and verse divisions.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.740]   These were added much later.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:18.980]   Therefore, we conclude that the overriding issue
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.180]   with spiritual gifts is that they are to be used in love.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:30.860]   That was not the story of the Corinthian church.
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:37.780]   But please, please, please, may it be the case at KFCI.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:48.740]   Our gifts, far from bringing personal glory,
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:55.580]   are to be used to bring glory to God and to help others.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:32:02.540]   Would you stand with me as the band comes back?
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.980]   (audience members clapping)
[00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:14.180]   We're gonna do ministry tonight in two different ways.
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:17.980]   In a moment, I'm gonna pray for each one of us.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.820]   But if you'd like personal prayer,
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.140]   if you have questions about spiritual gifts
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:26.380]   or would like to receive a spiritual gift,
[00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:27.940]   please come to the well afterwards
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.260]   and we'll pray for you.
[00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.460]   We'll pray for you one on one, two on two.
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:36.460]   However, as I prayed about this evening,
[00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:43.020]   I felt the Lord gave me two words.
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:46.900]   That's a spiritual gift, by the way.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:56.340]   He said, "Receive and go."
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.420]   And I believe this is so important.
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.740]   So often at church, when we talk about spiritual gifts,
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.740]   we say, "Hold your hand out, we're gonna pray for you."
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.420]   It's all about what we receive.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.860]   And that's important.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:13.860]   God is saying, "I want you to receive what I have for you."
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:19.020]   But the important thing about this today
[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.420]   is that God wants to put something in you
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:26.900]   that is not for you, it's for other people.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.220]   And I believe that this church,
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.660]   and we'll be seeing this so much more
[00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:36.020]   over the next six months, we've been praying about this,
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.780]   we're gonna have so much of focus on going.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.380]   It's not gonna be what happens in here,
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.980]   it's gonna be about going.
[00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.100]   So we receive the gifts and then we're going.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:53.540]   I got another picture really,
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.260]   and it's like this Christmas tree
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.540]   that's present here.
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.820]   It's got your name on.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.940]   God has got one of these with your name on.
[00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.740]   And you know what so many people do?
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:17.140]   We admire the packaging.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.460]   We leave it down there.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:25.460]   We don't even open up the gift that He has for us.
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.460]   I believe God has got something for each one of you tonight.
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.580]   And God is saying, "Will you open up the gift
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.140]   "that I've got for you?"
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.540]   Now maybe this is an area that's stretching you a little bit.
[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.780]   I hope it is.
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.020]   But what we're gonna do now
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:47.380]   is gonna ask God to come to us by His Spirit.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:53.540]   And God to send, bear in mind it's God that sends the gifts.
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.540]   It's not us or anybody else.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:35:00.100]   God will do it as He determines to each one.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:04.780]   And the reason why He wants to do this,
[00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.180]   He wants this church
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.620]   to go.
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:15.300]   To go to the people of Hong Kong.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.060]   We have people here today,
[00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:21.820]   actually, lovely to have Kelly from China
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:23.220]   and Latika from India.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:25.660]   We've got half the world's population here tonight.
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.900]   Really, seriously,
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.300]   to go.
[00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.660]   And I'm gonna invite you now
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.580]   just to hold your hands out in front of you.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:49.420]   Lord, we take you at Your Word.
[00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:52.660]   We're a church who believes in Your Word.
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.700]   We're a church that believes in Your Word.

[00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.980]   We're a church that believes in Your Word.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.580]   We're a church that believes in Your Word.
[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.380]   We're a church that believes in Your Word.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:41.180]   We're a church that believes in Your Word.
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.980]   We're a church that believes in Your Word.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.780]   We're a church that believes in Your Word.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:50.980]   We just spent some time just waiting.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:54.980]   And when we're ready, Paul will lead us.
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:59.580]   As we sing, Spirit of the Living God,
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:04.380]   would you fall afresh on me?
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:08.180]   Spirit of the Living God, would you fall afresh on our church,
[00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:12.780]   on our city, on our nation?
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:21.380]   [music]
[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:31.380]   Lord, I'm fed up with reading books about past revivals in Your church.
[00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:40.380]   May we be ready, Lord, to be the people who will take the gospel,
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:46.580]   take the gospel to the ends of the earth.
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:55.580]   Even though it may cost us our lives, our very lives.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:06.780]   Lord, what we have in our hands, what we have here today is so valuable.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.980]   I pray for that mother on the streets in India.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:20.380]   She's got so many children. She doesn't know what to do.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:27.780]   I pray for the businessman in China who is just so struggling at the moment with his mental health.
[00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.580]   He doesn't know whether he's going to be locked down next week or what,
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:34.980]   or whether he'll be able to do business again.
[00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:40.580]   He needs someone to come alongside him.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:45.380]   We pray for the young people of Hong Kong,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:50.980]   where they say, "I have no hope."
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:55.380]   Jesus, be their hope.
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:04.180]   And use us, send us, Lord.
[00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.980]   We cannot do this, Lord.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.780]   Empower us by Your Spirit.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.380]   We need You.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:18.380]   We need You, Lord.
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:29.380]   [Music]
