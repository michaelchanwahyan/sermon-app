1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Wow, that was such a heavy video clip to watch.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,540
 Good evening, everyone.

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,320
 My name is Michelle and I'm one of the pastors here.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,960
 It's great to be here to celebrate and to remember what Jesus has done for us.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,160
 But I come also with a heavy heart because we've just watched a video of Jesus who is

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,280
 suffering on the cross and who died for us.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,520
 And so today we come together really to remember what he has done for us.

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:49,880
 And today we'll be looking at the Gospel of Mark, the end of it, from chapters 14 to 16.

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:56,000
 So if you would like to follow along, you may open up your Bibles to those chapters.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,560
 And we're just coming together to see what it is that the author of the Gospel of Mark

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,760
 wants to tell us, because we have four different Gospels and each one will tell it slightly

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,920
 different because there is a message that the author wants to tell us.

13
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,720
 And so today we'll be seeing that there are a lot of people who will be trembling in these

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:29,080
 stories and they're trembling because they don't really understand and know that Jesus

15
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,280
 is the Son of God.

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,620
 But if we today, if we do know, we don't need to tremble.

17
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:44,000
 So now let us begin with a prayer.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,560
 Dear heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your word, the Bible that you have left

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,280
 to us, so we know about you and we know how much you love us.

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,840
 And we thank you that we have the opportunity to read your words and we thank you that you

21
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,140
 have given your spirit so that we may understand it.

22
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,920
 And today we all come before you praying that your spirit would be amongst us and you speak

23
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,680
 to us today.

24
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,920
 Thank you so much.

25
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,120
 In Jesus Christ's name we pray, amen.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,200
 Now so just before this scene that we've seen, Jesus was at the Garden of Gethsemane and

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,080
 he was praying because he's about to go onto the cross to do the mission that he came to

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:45,480
 do because as Son of God, he came to flesh and he's gonna take away the sins of the world.

29
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,400
 And so what we find is that one of his disciples, Judas, who betrayed him, is now coming with

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,680
 the servants of the high priests, the elders, and the religious leaders.

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,440
 And they're not coming with nothing.

32
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,400
 They came with swords and clubs ready to arrest Jesus.

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,120
 And this is what he said.

34
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,400
 Let's look at it together on the slide.

35
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:20,240
 Every day I was with you teaching in the temple courts and you did not arrest me, but the

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,400
 scriptures must be fulfilled.

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,360
 Then everyone deserted him and fled.

38
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,160
 A young man wearing nothing but a linen garment was following Jesus.

39
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,920
 When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garments behind.

40
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,920
 Now after this, we know that Jesus was brought to trial in front of the high priests and

41
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,120
 the Sanhedrin, which is a group of people who would judge on behalf of the Jews.

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,680
 And they could not find anything that's faulty of him.

43
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:03,240
 And the only thing that they seem to find is that he is the son, he is the king of Jews.

44
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,840
 But little did they know that's exactly who he is.

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,800
 And so what we find is that people are shouting afterwards and they want to crucify him.

46
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,720
 They want to kill him because they were out of jealousy.

47
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,680
 They want to get rid of Jesus.

48
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:33,520
 And so we see that during this arrest and the trial of Jesus and his disciples, they

49
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,400
 were trembling.

50
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:42,520
 They were fleeing for their lives at this moment because the Jesus that they knew and

51
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,200
 thought would be the Messiah is now arrested.

52
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:53,520
 And he's no longer that powerful God or Jesus that they knew from before.

53
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,920
 And so they were scared and they started to flee.

54
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,320
 And then Jesus began to be taken up.

55
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,440
 And he was just like a lamb who was about to go and be slaughtered.

56
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,240
 Now what was it in their mind at that time?

57
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,160
 They thought before the scene that Jesus would be the king and he would save them.

58
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,720
 And remember just a few chapters ago, he was riding on a donkey, humbly entering into Jerusalem.

59
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,640
 And just last week, we had our Palm Saturday where Pastor Johnny shared with us about how

60
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,520
 they were all cheering as he came into Jerusalem.

61
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,680
 And he said, "Hosanna, blessed is the one who came in the name of the Lord."

62
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,960
 And so they were prepared that he would be king.

63
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,360
 And also the other Jews thought as well as the disciples did that Jesus would be king.

64
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,480
 But how would he be king?

65
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:02,520
 They had their own ideas, which is that he would come mightily possibly beating down

66
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:11,280
 or resisting the Roman rule and to have their nations set to be independent.

67
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,880
 And that was the kind of Messiah and the king of Jews that they had in mind.

68
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,520
 And also because remember the three years that they had walked with Jesus?

69
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,600
 What did Jesus do?

70
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,560
 He walked on water.

71
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,880
 What else did he do?

72
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,760
 He fed the 5,000 and the 4,000 with just a few loaves of bread and a few fish.

73
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,680
 He were able to castle demons.

74
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,200
 He was able to heal the sick.

75
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:48,400
 He was able to talk to the authorities with authorities that they never knew of.

76
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,120
 And so all along up to this point, you see, Jesus was more or less the Messiah that they

77
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,000
 were thinking about.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
 One that would deliver them.

79
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,840
 But at this very moment when he was captured, this was no more.

80
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,960
 And in their hearts, this was a great discrepancy from what they thought their king of Jews

81
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
 would be.

82
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,440
 And so they fled.

83
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,960
 Did you see the young man in this verse?

84
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,000
 The young man actually fled naked.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,640
 That was how scared they were.

86
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,240
 Because you know why they're scared?

87
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,480
 They need to be on their own now.

88
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,120
 Before Jesus was in front of them and he would protect them and they were not afraid.

89
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,160
 But now every man for himself.

90
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,240
 They were running away.

91
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,800
 They were scared.

92
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,720
 And what's more?

93
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,640
 It's that this went against everything that they were hoping for.

94
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,800
 Remember when the disciples first became his disciples?

95
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,000
 I mean, I could imagine, although the Bible didn't say it, that they were imagining that

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,040
 sin from the moment they followed Jesus, it will be smooth sailing for them.

97
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,320
 Because they were with the king or the next leader.

98
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,760
 They did not think they would be running for their lives.

99
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
 No.

100
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:30,640
 That's probably the last thing they thought of when they thought of following a king.

101
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,360
 And so aren't we just like the disciples?

102
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,960
 When we first believed in God, didn't we want to be aligned with higher power?

103
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
 What did that mean?

104
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:47,640
 Well, if you're with higher power, he's able to do things for you.

105
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,720
 He's able to protect you when someone's attacking you.

106
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,960
 And thank God we don't have many of that physically done, but maybe at your workplace.

107
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,440
 Or he would be protecting you when something bad happened.

108
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,880
 And if you're suffering, he would deliver you.

109
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,160
 Isn't that why we too believed in Jesus at first?

110
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,640
 I mean, who here, you can raise your hand if that's you, believed in Jesus because you

111
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,520
 wanted to be fleeing away, running for your lives.

112
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,960
 And more suffering entering into your lives.

113
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
 Anyone?

114
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,920
 Okay, that's what I thought.

115
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,000
 You guys are quite logical people here.

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,960
 And no, why is it?

117
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,800
 Well, this brings us to the first point.

118
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,920
 In order so that we won't be trembling in any situation is that we need to know that

119
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,760
 God loves you beyond your expectations.

120
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,320
 Now let's face it, you and I both have some sort of expectations for God.

121
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,600
 Okay, they might be slightly different or vastly different, but you have your own thoughts

122
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,760
 about what God would look like, what he would do for you, right?

123
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,360
 And that is actually our own expectation of what God would be like.

124
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,080
 And sometimes, you know, God's right on the dot, so we're joyful.

125
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,720
 God did exactly, you know, as I prayed.

126
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,480
 And then there are other times where it's so far off, we're wondering, "Jesus, did you

127
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,200
 get arrested again?"

128
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,400
 And sometimes we get so disappointed and scared to the point because we need to be facing

129
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:38,400
 our own situations by ourselves that we might desert him like the disciples.

130
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:46,960
 And in here, it actually recorded that Peter denied Jesus three times during the trial.

131
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:56,000
 And sometimes when Jesus seems to be arrested in our situation, we begin to doubt.

132
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,840
 We begin to question, "Is this the God that I thought he was?

133
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,440
 Is this the God?

134
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,360
 Is this really God at all?"

135
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:17,260
 But the truth is, and I want all of us to remember that truth, is that God loves you

136
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,120
 beyond your imagination, beyond what you think he would be.

137
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,680
 Just because he's not acting the way that you expected, that does not mean he does not

138
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
 love you.

139
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,840
 It does not mean that he is not God.

140
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,600
 I remember the earlier passage when we read it.

141
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:44,720
 It said that when Jesus was being arrested, he said, "So that the Scriptures must be fulfilled."

142
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,240
 Now what Scripture was he referring to?

143
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,160
 It's Isaiah 53, verse 7 to 12.

144
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,120
 And I'm just going to read part of it.

145
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:06,800
 "He was led like a lamb to the slaughterer, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent.

146
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,660
 So he did not open his mouth.

147
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,560
 For the transgression of my people, he was punished.

148
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:21,000
 The Lord makes his life an offering for sin."

149
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,600
 You see, while the disciples thought that Jesus was being arrested, he was simply, not

150
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:40,000
 simply, he was actually fulfilling the Scriptures, the will of the Lord.

151
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,200
 Now what is it that I want to say?

152
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,880
 Just because you think God should act like this, he should do that, and when he doesn't,

153
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,760
 it doesn't mean that he doesn't have something better in mind.

154
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,240
 And in this case, he had the best thing in mind, because while the disciples were only

155
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,200
 worrying about the King of Jews and trying to get their nations back together, Jesus

156
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:16,040
 was thinking about something greater, something that's eternal, that he would be a sin offering

157
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:25,680
 once and for all, so that one day when we're in judgment, that we would no longer need

158
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:35,960
 to be looked at as sinful, but that all our sins would be pardoned.

159
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:42,120
 And sometimes I think we don't really, really, really understand it, and that includes myself

160
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,480
 as well.

161
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,440
 I don't think we can really comprehend.

162
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,440
 I often think that we're like a three-year-old, and we're trying to pray for a teddy bear,

163
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,680
 "Oh, Father, I really want a teddy bear."

164
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,280
 And when God doesn't give us the teddy bear, we seem to kick and scream and say, "God,

165
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
 you don't love me.

166
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,040
 I just wanted the teddy bear.

167
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,560
 I wanted nothing else, and you're withholding this from me."

168
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,600
 And whatever the situation you're facing, it's really real, and that's what's on your

169
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,400
 heart.

170
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:24,240
 But I also feel that God just want to say, "My son, my daughter, there's a reason I'm

171
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,080
 not giving the teddy bear to you.

172
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,960
 You might not understand, but you know what?

173
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,680
 I have a bank account loaded with money, okay?

174
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,800
 And you can buy as many teddy bears as you want."

175
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,080
 Now I'm using that analogy not to say that Jesus is going to pour out money to you.

176
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
 That's not the message.

177
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,920
 Please don't get it wrong, and he might, but that's not what I'm saying.

178
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:57,160
 What I'm saying is that our understanding and our focus is so narrow and small that

179
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:04,120
 we kick and scream when he has got this abundance for us, when he, here it says, that he has

180
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,740
 wiped out all our sins.

181
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:13,400
 And sometimes I think we cannot really comprehend that because the teddy bear is so real, and

182
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,720
 it's so important to us.

183
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,160
 But when we grow up, we do understand what that million dollars mean, right?

184
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,840
 So one day, I always think when we're faced in judgment, we're like, "Oh my God, thank

185
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,280
 you, thank you."

186
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:36,400
 But at this moment, though, just wanted us to all hold onto the truth that God loves

187
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,480
 us, loves you beyond your expectations.

188
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,360
 And don't let your expectations box in.

189
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,920
 God, just because he doesn't act the way you expect, that means he doesn't love you, that

190
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,480
 means he's not God.

191
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,440
 Seems pretty illogical if you think about it.

192
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,000
 But that's how we feel a lot of the times.

193
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,440
 And so when we tremble now at situations where it seems like God is not answering our prayers

194
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:19,600
 or not yet answering, we can hold onto this truth that he loves us beyond our expectation,

195
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,600
 and he will show us what's next.

196
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:35,240
 So don't let your expectations of who he is block you from seeing how much he loves you.

197
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:44,240
 Now as we look at Mark 15, Mark chapter 15, we know that he was brought before Pilate,

198
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,980
 who was the Roman governor with authority to give sentence death.

199
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,720
 Now even though he couldn't find any crime that he had committed, he didn't find any

200
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,920
 crime that Jesus did, but because of the pressure and how the crowd was pressuring him, that

201
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:12,480
 eventually he did allow a sentence death for Jesus.

202
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,900
 And only because he called himself the King of Jews, and he was beaten and he was mocked,

203
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:25,240
 he was spat on, he was at his greatest hour of distress.

204
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,720
 Now Mark didn't seem to record any of his disciples at this scene, but let's read a

205
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,400
 bit in verse 33.

206
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,320
 This is chapter 15, verse 33, which was what we saw earlier in the film.

207
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,680
 At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.

208
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:55,160
 And at three in the afternoon, Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Aloi, aloi, lama sabbatani,"

209
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,080
 which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

210
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,520
 And with a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.

211
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,320
 The curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.

212
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,700
 And when the centurion who stood there in front of Jesus saw how he died, he said, "Surely

213
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,880
 this man was the son of God."

214
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,640
 Now some women were watching from distance.

215
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,600
 Some of them were Mary Madeline, Mary the mother of James the Younger, and of Joseph

216
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,820
 and Salome.

217
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:39,120
 Many other women who came up, who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.

218
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,520
 Now there was darkness at noon.

219
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:50,120
 It lasted for three hours, and at three, Jesus cried out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken

220
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
 me?"

221
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,080
 Now this is actually a reference to Psalm 22, verse one, where there was a righteous

222
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,520
 man crying out, and he was suffering so much.

223
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:09,440
 And actually in that Psalm, at the end, he said that his God would vindicate him.

224
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,360
 So at the time when he was calling out, it wasn't just out of agony, but also referring

225
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,960
 that he knows that God would vindicate him as well.

226
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:29,560
 And so he breathed his last breath, and then he died on the cross.

227
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,880
 Now something interesting was revealed here.

228
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,760
 Now the curtain was torn into two, from top to bottom.

229
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,040
 Now what curtain is this?

230
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,080
 We can have a look at the temple.

231
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,040
 As we see, the temple actually has, this is the floor plan of it, and there is a curtain

232
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,640
 that separates the Holy of Holies, which is the holiest place in the temple, aside from

233
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,560
 other places where they would be worshiping God.

234
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:03,560
 It's so holy that only the high priest gets to go in once a year, and the other priests

235
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,800
 would be outside doing their daily offerings outside.

236
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:14,580
 And so at three in the afternoon, that's the time when other priests would be outside doing

237
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,580
 other offerings.

238
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:24,400
 They would be able to witness the supernatural torn tear of this curtain.

239
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,400
 Now why is this important?

240
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,480
 Why did Mark put it in?

241
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,440
 Because he wanted to tell us that Jesus who died on the cross, he's just not any regular

242
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,880
 man.

243
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,660
 He was the one who was able to bear all of our sins.

244
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,880
 Because he was able to bear all of our sins before it required a priest who would represent

245
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,640
 the people to make an offering to God.

246
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:54,560
 But if this curtain has been torn, it means that they no longer need to, through someone

247
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,320
 else, go to the Lord, go to God, but instead, because their sins were taken care of, that

248
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:08,600
 they have direct access, that we have direct access to God.

249
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,800
 Now you might think, why is it important for us?

250
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,160
 Because we don't, right now when we pray, we can go directly to God.

251
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:27,040
 But what we notice here is that all of this has happened, okay?

252
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:35,120
 This momentous moment, this moment where God is making history.

253
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,800
 I want to ask, where are the disciples?

254
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
 Where are they?

255
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,040
 Well, they fled.

256
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,360
 Of course, in other accounts, we find that there are some disciples who are there, but

257
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,440
 in this account, there are none.

258
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,640
 There are only the names of some women, okay?

259
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,080
 Now you're asking, why is this important for us to note?

260
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,960
 Well, think about this.

261
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,240
 Jesus predicted his death to his disciples.

262
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,560
 Do you know how many times?

263
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,600
 Three times.

264
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,920
 But he only disclosed it to his disciples, which meant that they had insider information.

265
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,220
 They were the only ones who knew about this.

266
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,800
 But you know what?

267
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:35,120
 They were not able to recognize that Jesus, who is dying on the cross right now, who was

268
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,000
 dying on the cross then, was the son of God.

269
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,760
 And neither were the women who had been with Jesus for all this time, who had ministered

270
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,400
 to him and who he ministered to.

271
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,160
 They also were not able to recognize that he is the son of God.

272
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,520
 Now why is that?

273
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,840
 Jesus had been with them three years.

274
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,320
 And yet the most ironic thing happens.

275
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,880
 A centurion out of nowhere, now what is a centurion?

276
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:15,440
 A centurion is a Roman governor official who looked after about 100 soldiers.

277
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,280
 Out of nowhere, with no context, no teaching from Jesus, don't even have a Jewish background,

278
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,480
 knows nothing about God.

279
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:37,120
 And he, seeing how Jesus died, said, "Surely this is the son of God."

280
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,400
 How can that be?

281
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,120
 Well this gets to our second point, which is God reveals himself to whosoever will.

282
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:59,080
 Now in the beginning, he only revealed himself to Jesus' disciples, the 12 of them.

283
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,760
 Now when he was trialed, he revealed himself to more because he told them that, "Yes, I

284
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,960
 am the king of Jews."

285
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:16,440
 But now he is extending it to this centurion who's a Gentile, meaning not a Jewish, not

286
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:25,560
 within the nations where Jesus came from, that he is the son of God.

287
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,720
 So don't you see?

288
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,600
 Isn't that the same with us sometimes?

289
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:40,240
 When we think we know the Bible so well, we know who Jesus is, and actually we begin to

290
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,200
 box him in what we perceive him to be.

291
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,800
 Because at that time when the disciples saw that Jesus was being crucified, this was so

292
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:58,120
 far off from their understanding of Jesus, that they could not recognize him.

293
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:05,840
 They could not recognize that this, Jesus being crucified, was the son of God.

294
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,040
 Now I'm not asking you to don't read the Bible.

295
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:16,480
 What I'm saying is there are truths that only in the Bible we would find, but would we sometimes

296
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:28,720
 misinterpret it, and would we sometimes be boxing God into our way of how he would act?

297
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,240
 Because think about it.

298
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,100
 The centurion had no background, no understanding.

299
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:42,480
 He simply saw what it was, and he was enlightened by God, that Jesus, who was crucified, is

300
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,660
 the son of God.

301
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:52,380
 Now so we can easily miss the works of God if we're too quick to what?

302
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:58,420
 Jump to conclusions without knowledge and understanding of the Bible.

303
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:06,200
 How we interpret it requires God to constantly help us.

304
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,820
 Now I think if we put it in a little bit of a practical example, it would be Jesus, who's

305
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,640
 coming now, not like what they thought.

306
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,900
 What is he coming now?

307
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:23,380
 He isn't that king that would ride on a white horse and start using his amazing powers to

308
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,420
 zap the enemies.

309
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:37,180
 That's not how he came, but he came as the servant king to serve and not to be served.

310
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:44,500
 And so our understanding of him sometimes would box him in.

311
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:51,540
 And so to help us a little with like a life example, well think about it.

312
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,180
 I mean would we sometimes know where to serve?

313
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:00,100
 So what we do is we sign up for all the things that are the serving opportunities that the

314
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,500
 church has, and we're like very passionate when we go out there.

315
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,600
 And then when your husband or your mother or your wife asks you, "Can you pass me that

316
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,020
 glass of water over there?"

317
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,020
 You're like, "Ah, no."

318
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,180
 You can get it yourself.

319
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:20,060
 Because serving meant to go out, you know?

320
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:27,300
 But no, when we misinterpret it or when we box him in, yeah, it only limits to outside.

321
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,900
 But it's inside as well.

322
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:40,140
 And also, what about how Jesus extended this revelation that he is the son of God to a

323
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,180
 centurion, which is someone outside their group, right?

324
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:52,940
 Would we sometimes then be like this, where we see someone who's dressed nicely, that

325
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,300
 person looks rich, and we're thinking, "Oh, these are all nice people.

326
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,180
 I'm going to tell them the good news."

327
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,180
 But you know what?

328
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,660
 That person, nah, like it's just an evil person.

329
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:10,020
 And we begin to limit what God might want to do.

330
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:17,800
 So what I want to say is God does things beyond our imagination, and we need to be careful

331
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,460
 not to jump to conclusions.

332
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,980
 Because if God wanted to come on a cross and die for us, I don't think there's anything

333
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,740
 outside of his imagination.

334
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,500
 And we can't really keep up sometimes.

335
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:38,100
 So just be open-minded as well about what God's doing.

336
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,060
 Don't be too quick to judge if that's how God's doing things.

337
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,460
 I mean, that might include just ordinary things.

338
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,700
 We might look at another church and how they do things, and we might say, "Oh, that's not

339
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
 how to do it.

340
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,180
 God doesn't want it to be done this way.

341
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,420
 Those hymns, they're outdated.

342
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,780
 Oh, these contemporary music, oh, they're too loud."

343
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,540
 Or we might start to think, "Oh, this raising hand, oh, this is too much.

344
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,620
 You know, oh, this is too little."

345
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,900
 And we might start to think, "Oh, this is how to do small groups.

346
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,220
 No, we should have a big fellowship."

347
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,100
 And we find ourselves just thinking about all these things.

348
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,500
 And we might be thinking, "These etiquettes are good."

349
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,260
 And other people think etiquettes, they're out of date.

350
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:30,060
 Speaking in tongues, you know, that's definitely have ended.

351
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,060
 No, it's still happening here.

352
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,260
 And healing, you know, that has stopped.

353
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,860
 Don't have any healing prayers.

354
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,940
 No, it's happening.

355
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,660
 And so, you know what?

356
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:47,420
 When we're thinking about all that things in our head, what you find is that we might

357
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:53,740
 have a newcomer who comes into our service, and then at the end of it, while we're still

358
00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:02,380
 trying to judge what God's trying to do, that newcomer may say, "Ah, I felt the presence

359
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,740
 of God."

360
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:13,660
 So what I want to say is that don't let our understanding of God, don't let our knowledge

361
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,140
 or our interpretation of it limit what God's doing.

362
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,420
 I don't know what He's doing, but let's try to keep up with Him.

363
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,820
 Apparently, He's very creative, as we can see, and He's God.

364
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:32,660
 And He's gonna do things outside our imagination.

365
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:43,040
 So now, I really want a moment for us to just think about, rather or not, we ourselves have

366
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,440
 boxed God in.

367
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,220
 And today is an Easter Saturday.

368
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:56,300
 I just wanted us to reflect, has there been moments where we said, "If you were God, you

369
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,460
 would do this."

370
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:06,060
 And has there been moments where, "Since you didn't do this, I don't think you are God."

371
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:12,260
 And I just want us to reflect, maybe even today as you walked in, you know, you just

372
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,260
 thought, "Oh, this is gonna be another service.

373
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,980
 I'm just gonna hear and I'm gonna go."

374
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:29,900
 But what if, what if God at this time is convicting you to believe in Him, or convicting you again

375
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:37,700
 that in your doubts, "I, He is still loving you."

376
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,980
 Now in a moment, Pastor John will be leading us in communion.

377
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:51,140
 And I just wanted us to kind of think about how we, as we expect, and we have expectations

378
00:31:51,140 --> 00:32:03,220
 of who Jesus is, and how that has really affected us in believing simply, maybe like the centurion,

379
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:09,220
 "Surely this is the Son of God."

380
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,580
 And so in a moment, I'll be praying a prayer for all of us.

381
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:21,940
 And I would invite you at that time, if God has convicted you in any way today, rather

382
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:29,260
 it be that you see for the first time that Jesus who was crucified was actually the Son

383
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,060
 of God.

384
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:39,180
 Or maybe you had walked away for some time because you think that Jesus had disappointed

385
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:48,300
 you, but today His Spirit is reminding you that He loves you, and you're convicted by

386
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
 that.

387
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:57,540
 I want you to respond later by simply in your heart telling Jesus that you believe in Him,

388
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,780
 that He is the Son of God.

389
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:07,340
 So if there's any way, and I'm even limiting God when I name out those scenarios.

390
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:17,460
 So whatever it is, in whatever way, if Jesus is convicting you right now, that as we pray

391
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:25,100
 together and as you truly believe that Jesus who has died on the cross has taken away your

392
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:32,860
 sins and that He is the Son of God and He loves you and you're willing to give Him all

393
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,020
 your sins and follow Him.

394
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:41,500
 And when we pray and ask you to respond, simply respond in your heart and pray to Him because

395
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,060
 He's listening.

396
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,540
 He can hear you.

397
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:47,820
 Let us pray together now.

398
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:53,900
 Oh, dear Heavenly Father.

399
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:59,500
 How many times have we boxed you in?

400
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:08,300
 How many times have we misunderstood you and thought that you're not God or that you don't

401
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,820
 love us?

402
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:19,580
 And how many times, Father, do we still be slow to understand like the disciples when

403
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:27,340
 you've told us again and again about what to happen and we still don't get it?

404
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,940
 Father, we pray for your spirit to work.

405
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:43,380
 The centurion was able to receive this knowledge that the disciples couldn't in three years.

406
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:47,100
 And maybe there are many of us here today.

407
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,580
 We just can't comprehend it.

408
00:34:49,580 --> 00:35:00,580
 But, Father, we pray that your spirit now would convict them, convict us that Jesus

409
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:07,620
 is the Son of God, came to die for our sins and He loves us.

410
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:16,140
 He loves us so much that He's willing to walk onto the cross willingly like a lamb that's

411
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,340
 about to be slaughtered.

412
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:27,940
 And so now I invite you, if your heart is convicted of this truth, that you just tell

413
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:34,420
 Him, "Lord, I believe that you're the Son of God.

414
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,480
 I want to give you my life."

415
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,980
 Even if you're a Christian who has walked away, you can still say the same prayer.

416
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:54,540
 Or even if you have been a Christian following God, but you had expectations and you wanted

417
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,940
 to repent of that, you can do that too.

418
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,940
 Just going to take a moment here where it's just you and God.

419
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,300
