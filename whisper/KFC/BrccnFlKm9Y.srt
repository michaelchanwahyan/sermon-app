1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
 I want to ask you a question.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,000
 What gets you up in the morning?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,720
 When a job interviewer asks you that question, what gets you up in the morning?

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,120
 You might be thinking to yourself, coffee.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:31,800
 But that, according to experts, is the wrong answer.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:41,060
 Interviewers who ask this question are looking to see what fuels your everyday life.

7
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,560
 We all have something that motivates us.

8
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:55,560
 And they are looking for you to help them understand what it is for you exactly.

9
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,480
 Researchers tell us the five best answers are, "What gets me up in the morning is the

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,680
 opportunity to learn something new."

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,600
 Or "What gets me up in the morning is the ability to make mistakes."

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:22,320
 Or "What gets me up in the morning is the ability to work with a team."

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,440
 What gets me up in the morning is the opportunity to compete.

14
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,920
 I love friendly competition.

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,240
 And lastly, what gets me up in the morning is the notion that every day is a brand new

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,960
 day to grow.

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,320
 Now if you're about to go for a job interview, take your phone out, do a screenshot.

18
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,600
 These are the right answers.

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:59,800
 But what gets me up in the morning is to be part of building the kingdom of God.

20
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,880
 Now that might sound a little bit weird or specific, but that one statement contains

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:18,400
 all the things that are dear to me, specifically the unity of God's church.

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,920
 I've been in this role here at KFCI for almost six years now.

23
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,720
 It's gone quickly, eh?

24
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:37,000
 And when people ask me why I took this position, my answer is simple, bridge building.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,960
 In my 35 years in Hong Kong, I have witnessed so much division in the body of Christ.

26
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,960
 Denomination against denomination.

27
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,720
 Edges between Protestants and Catholics.

28
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,600
 Charismatics and evangelicals.

29
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,440
 International and local churches.

30
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:14,040
 Christians are wasting more energy fighting each other than fighting the real enemy.

31
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:21,760
 I've seen church splits and some people who seem to change church more often than they

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,040
 change their toothpaste.

33
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,360
 And to be honest, you can hear it in my tone of voice.

34
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,400
 It makes me sick.

35
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,960
 Which is why I prefer to build bridges and tear down walls rather than the other way

36
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,520
 round.

37
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:53,880
 I just wish people would see through the lens of the kingdom.

38
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,160
 There is one kingdom and there is one King.

39
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:07,640
 My job, my calling, my passion is kingdom building.

40
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:14,560
 Now you might say, surely, isn't it as a pastor to build the church?

41
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,280
 And you'd have a point.

42
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,680
 The church was precious to Jesus and it's precious to me.

43
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:32,440
 The church is precious to me and that's why we're having this series.

44
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,400
 But in that, I am guided by the words of Jesus.

45
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,360
 Matthew 6, 33, I'll put it on the screen, you know it.

46
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:50,960
 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be

47
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,920
 added to you.

48
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:01,800
 This is slap bang in the middle of the sermon of the mount as Jesus encourages His followers

49
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,760
 not to worry about the things of this world.

50
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,200
 Verse 31, asks some important questions.

51
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,720
 So do not worry saying, what should we eat?

52
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,160
 I bet some of you are thinking already, what am I going to eat for dinner tonight?

53
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
 I know.

54
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,960
 What should we eat?

55
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,200
 What should we drink?

56
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,080
 What should we wear?

57
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:34,200
 What Jesus was saying is do not equate your life to the level of the Hang Seng Index or

58
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:40,320
 the latest pair of sneakers, Johnny.

59
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,400
 Or the good looking guy or girl you've got your eyes on.

60
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,000
 We are to be kingdom seekers.

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,680
 That means submitting to the King, doing the will of the King and making Christ the King

62
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,200
 your first priority.

63
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,880
 But look at this.

64
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:11,880
 Jesus told Peter after Peter had declared that Jesus was the Messiah in Matthew 16.

65
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:21,200
 Jesus said this, "I will build my church."

66
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,760
 I will build my church.

67
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:31,360
 We've spent six weeks together on church together, looking at the early church and what it means

68
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,840
 to be a church together.

69
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:45,320
 We've looked at being steeped in the word of God, in prayer, in hospitality and community.

70
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,920
 And we have demonstrated them too.

71
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:55,280
 Who could forget James's amazing recital of the book of Philippians?

72
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,880
 The yummy dinner.

73
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,240
 And Johnny going around not with a glass of sake, but the whole bottle, you know.

74
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,720
 The moving group prayer that we had that week.

75
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:17,100
 And the need for a Paul, a Timothy and a Barnabas.

76
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:26,840
 We found the church that Jesus built still to be alive and ready to move forward in these

77
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,860
 challenging times.

78
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,440
 Let's face it, they are.

79
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,240
 Soon after Jesus died and rose from the dead, He did exactly that.

80
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:44,760
 He built His church and He has been building it since.

81
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:52,040
 And yet the danger of so many of us, and dare I say, especially us pastors, is for us to

82
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,880
 fall into the trap of believing it's our church.

83
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
 I know this.

84
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,680
 Look, when I ask people, I say, "What church do you attend?"

85
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,400
 They sometimes answer, "Oh, so-and-so's church."

86
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,040
 So-and-so being the name of the pastor.

87
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:15,000
 And I say, "So-and-so doesn't have a church."

88
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,040
 And we've been looking these past six weeks at what it means to be Christ's church.

89
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,880
 The one He birthed on the day of Pentecost.

90
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:34,360
 And what I need to do tonight is really look at these five words closely.

91
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,480
 I will build my church.

92
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,840
 In fact, just to wake you up, let's say it all together, shall we?

93
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
 One, two, three.

94
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,120
 I will build my church.

95
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
 Ten out of ten.

96
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
 Well done.

97
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,720
 Now, the first word, "I."

98
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,920
 Maybe you could miss it.

99
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,060
 It marks Christ's lordship.

100
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,160
 The first word in this statement is "I."

101
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,840
 This marks the unique position of Christ as Lord.

102
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:16,280
 Nobody else is in a position to say what follows this "I."

103
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:23,320
 Jesus is the only rightful founder and head of the church.

104
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:32,600
 Not you or me or someone else, no matter how eminent they are.

105
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:40,120
 It's the same "I" as in "I am the way, the truth, and the life."

106
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,880
 Who else can say that?

107
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,720
 The second word, "will."

108
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,600
 It marks Christ's authority.

109
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,440
 When Jesus says, "will," He expresses His authority.

110
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,140
 He says this in Matthew 28, 18.

111
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,120
 It's at the end of the Great Commission, isn't it?

112
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:07,600
 That Jesus came to them and said, "All authority on heaven and on earth has been given to me."

113
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,760
 His will is supreme, except for the will of His Father.

114
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,160
 Again, I'm speaking somewhat harshly, yet I hope appropriately.

115
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:30,760
 It's surprising how many believers in Christ proceed according to what pleases them.

116
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:37,880
 We're building a consumer culture into the church without bothering to ask if it pleases

117
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,360
 Christ and seeking their master's authority.

118
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,880
 Whatever is not according to His will is contrary to it.

119
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,660
 The third word, "build," marks Christ's work.

120
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,840
 When Jesus says, "build," He expresses His work.

121
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,720
 In the book of John, He says this, "My food is to do the will of the one who sent me to

122
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
 finish His work."

123
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:13,720
 He then goes on to say, "My Father is at work until now, so I am at work."

124
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:26,160
 My friends, promoting a dogma, a doctrine, a denomination is not the work of Jesus Christ.

125
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:36,140
 Only in helping to build the church Christ died for are we doing Christ's work.

126
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:42,240
 The fourth word, "my," indicates Christ's possession.

127
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,640
 The church's one foundation is Jesus Christ.

128
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,960
 I want to read it to you from Corinthians.

129
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:56,680
 No man can lay a foundation other than the one who has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.

130
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,640
 The church is His bride whom He loves.

131
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,640
 She belongs to no other.

132
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:12,920
 Ephesians 5, we have this at weddings sometimes, "Christ loved the church and gave Himself

133
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,200
 up for her."

134
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,520
 And lastly, number five, "church," marks Christ's call.

135
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:29,040
 When Jesus says, "church," He expresses His call to the world.

136
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,780
 Jesus calls everyone to His one true church.

137
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:38,840
 The called out people, the Bible calls them the Ekklesia.

138
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,840
 2 Timothy 1 says, "God has saved us and called us with a holy calling."

139
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:52,240
 That's the only way that we are being made into a true church.

140
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,880
 KFCI.

141
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:03,080
 In every word of that statement, I will build my church.

142
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:11,840
 We are brought to the realisation that Christ's church is what we should be restoring and

143
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,920
 establishing in the world.

144
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:22,000
 It is Christ's church that we have been discussing for six weeks, and it is Christ's church that

145
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,960
 is to be prayer-centred, Word-rooted, hospitality-driven, and community-based.

146
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,240
 Because when these things are present, there is a result.

147
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,380
 And what a result it is.

148
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:44,640
 The result is we grow.

149
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,680
 We read, didn't we hear, verse 44, "The church was unified, the church was magnified, and

150
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,120
 then the church multiplied."

151
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:03,400
 It had a powerful testimony amongst the unsaved Jews, not only because of the miracles done

152
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,960
 by the apostles, which are in verse 43, but also by the way the members of the fellowship

153
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,560
 loved each other and served the Lord.

154
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,880
 I tell you ladies, if I'd walked into the YMCA this morning when you were having sisterhood

155
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,480
 and I was a lady from outside the church and I could see the way that you were relating

156
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,360
 to each other and loved each other, as a lady I would say, "What's going on?"

157
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,480
 I want part of that.

158
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,600
 If you were taking your dog for a walk down Repulse Bay Beach this morning and you happened

159
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,080
 to witness the baptism, you'd say, "What's going on?"

160
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:51,120
 But really the love that we show for each other is the most important thing.

161
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,960
 That's why we've been talking about community.

162
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
 That's why we've been talking about hospitality.

163
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:03,200
 That's why Agnes came and gave us that testimony about inviting friends around her table.

164
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:13,520
 The risen Lord continued to work with them and people continued to be saved.

165
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,520
 I mean, what a church.

166
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:23,080
 The Christians you meet in the book of Acts were not content to meet once a week for services

167
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,200
 as usual.

168
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,040
 They met daily, they cared daily, they won souls daily, they searched the scriptures

169
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,760
 daily and increased in number daily.

170
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,720
 And it was not a five minute wonder.

171
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,020
 It was not the flavour of the month.

172
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:49,160
 Even if we dive forward into Paul's missionary journeys before he received what we call his

173
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,480
 Macedonian call to go to Europe.

174
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,720
 We read this in Acts 16, 5.

175
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:05,080
 So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.

176
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:12,160
 Their Christian faith was a day to day reality, not a once a week routine.

177
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,400
 Why?

178
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,920
 Because the risen Christ was a living reality to them and his resurrection power was at

179
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,320
 work in their lives through his spirit.

180
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,120
 Let me explore this a little bit more as I finish Acts 2.

181
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:37,600
 A chapter, if you remember when we started off, when the day of Pentecost came, they

182
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,400
 were all together in one place.

183
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,240
 Do you remember that?

184
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,160
 The final verses say this.

185
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:52,000
 Everyone was filled with awe at the many wonders and signs performed by the apostles, praising

186
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,040
 God and enjoying the favour of all the people.

187
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:04,000
 And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved.

188
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,480
 I want to highlight three outcomes in these verses.

189
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,920
 First is we read everyone was filled with awe.

190
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:21,880
 I was actually going to use the word fear because the word for awe in verse 33 is a

191
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:29,640
 Greek word, it's phobos, which can mean fear, terror or reverence.

192
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,960
 We get our English word phobia from it.

193
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,680
 But fear definitely has a double meaning.

194
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,360
 I think so much of Hong Kong at the moment is gripped in fear.

195
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,600
 For example, we are encouraged to fear God.

196
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,080
 Fearing the Lord means to be in reverent awe of his holiness, to give him complete reverence

197
00:17:53,080 --> 00:18:01,960
 and to honour him as the God of great glory, majesty and purity.

198
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:13,240
 Now note this, the early church took seriously the command to lay hands on the sick.

199
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,400
 And we read that they saw many signs and wonders.

200
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:28,560
 The modern church would do well to do the same, remembering that we don't heal anyone.

201
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,560
 I've never healed anyone.

202
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:39,540
 We pray God heals if he chooses to.

203
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:44,800
 If we pray for 99 people and nobody gets healed, what do we do?

204
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,480
 We pray for number 100.

205
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:59,800
 But the reality is the more we pray, the more miracles and healings we see.

206
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:06,560
 And that was certainly the case for the axe church, which is why Luke said everyone was

207
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:15,240
 filled with awe, which leads to my second F, which is favour.

208
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:23,840
 Verse 47 said that they enjoy favour, which actually is the same word as the word used

209
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,360
 for grace.

210
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:33,640
 People were amazed and favourable towards them.

211
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,880
 This should be the result of our witness, that people praise God and have favour towards

212
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,760
 the church.

213
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:53,480
 I remember leading a mission team in Bacolod in the Philippines in the 90s with ICM.

214
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,240
 We came to the house of a middle-aged man called Ignacio.

215
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,760
 Sandra remember this very well.

216
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,160
 She was blind due to a terrible motorcycle accident.

217
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,960
 The motorcycle exploded and it had burnt most of his skin.

218
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,600
 I wouldn't show you a picture because it was horrible.

219
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:27,100
 Our team prayed for him and by the grace of God, his eyesight was partially restored.

220
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,480
 He started to see things that he hadn't seen since his tragic accident.

221
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,200
 And after that, his eyesight continued to improve and he now lives and ministers in

222
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,320
 a mountain area in a colder climate.

223
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:54,840
 The thing was, it wasn't even me that prayed, but two or three members of our youth group.

224
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:04,520
 But the result mirrored Acts 2 and left everyone praising God and adding so much favour to

225
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,880
 ICM and their wonderful work in the slums in the Philippines.

226
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,080
 This brings out an important lesson.

227
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:25,600
 We are not to seek man's praises, but always point to the almighty God.

228
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:35,300
 But as we do so, the church should be looked upon with favour.

229
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:41,680
 But the best result of all and the best F of all is faith.

230
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:50,480
 Every day, more and more people were coming to faith in Christ and joining the church

231
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,880
 family.

232
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:59,040
 The result of this church family studying the scriptures together, doing life together,

233
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,040
 sharing meals and communion together, praying together.

234
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:10,860
 Is there something so unique, distinct and wonderful about them that others can't help

235
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,500
 come to faith in Christ?

236
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,720
 We heard this in the testimonies this morning at the baptisms.

237
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,360
 They could not help come to faith in Christ because of what they saw.

238
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,340
 Now it's not that they don't evangelise and witness.

239
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,940
 They do.

240
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,680
 But how they live positively influences their witness.

241
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,880
 I listened to one pastor this week.

242
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,240
 His name is Skip Heidzik, believe it or not.

243
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,120
 He said, "Our withness aids our witness."

244
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,720
 I'll say it again.

245
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,960
 Our withness aids our witness.

246
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,160
 My earnest prayer for KFCI is this.

247
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:09,460
 That we would become, that we would be known as a kingdom church.

248
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:15,560
 And in that connection, I want to just share some of the things which are on our heart,

249
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,860
 which will be happening in the next few months.

250
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,700
 I hope you'll get excited about this.

251
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,080
 The first thing is family, church is family.

252
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,320
 And I'm pleased to announce that from September, we're going to have a family gathering every

253
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,480
 day hosted by James and Christine and the family, Joe and Alex and others.

254
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,080
 Because it's very difficult on a Saturday afternoon.

255
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,120
 Have you noticed we don't have kids here, right?

256
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:52,160
 So what we're going to be doing in September is we're going to be starting a family expression.

257
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,540
 We don't know where that's going to go.

258
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,940
 We hope it may become eventually a service or something like that.

259
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,600
 But at the moment, it's a pop-up shop, right?

260
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:08,520
 We're going to start in September hosting a family gathering on Sundays for people with

261
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,400
 family, because families are important.

262
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,560
 When we started this church, it was nearly all young people, but the young people are

263
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,160
 getting older, they're getting married and they're having families and we're changing,

264
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
 right?

265
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
 And it's good.

266
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,360
 We want to be able to cope with the emerging market that's within us.

267
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,620
 So I am, I tell you what, I am so excited about this.

268
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,620
 You would not believe it.

269
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:36,760
 I know I get excited about a lot, but I'm so excited about this.

270
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,080
 If you'd like to know a lot more, go and speak to Bonnie or contact James and Christine,

271
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,100
 go to the welcome counter.

272
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,520
 But we are going to be doing this as a church and it's part of who we are.

273
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,720
 You say, "Oh, what happens about James preaching on a Saturday?"

274
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,360
 Well, James is going to be preaching at least every six weeks on a Saturday as well.

275
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,840
 So we're not going to be losing James, okay?

276
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,320
 He's going to be doing this as well.

277
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,580
 I don't know how he fits it all in 24 hours, but that's another thing.

278
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,640
 The next thing is this is going to really excite you.

279
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:12,240
 It's what I call 5G, raising up the next generation of preachers.

280
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,440
 You know, I'm getting old, right?

281
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,280
 And I'm not going to be here forever, but actually we've got people in this congregation

282
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,120
 who are not pastors, who actually we're going to give an opportunity to preach the Word

283
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,200
 of God.

284
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,960
 And we did it last year and the next slide will show you what we're going to do.

285
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,160
 This is really going to excite you.

286
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,720
 Next week, Bonnie will be preaching.

287
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,200
 She's going to have more people here than I am.

288
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
 I know that, right?

289
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,440
 I mean, the place is going to be packed, right?

290
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,060
 I know that.

291
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,800
 But Bonnie is going to draw these six weeks together and preach a sermon that she's done

292
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,120
 for her master's course.

293
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,480
 She's studying master's in theology at the moment.

294
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
 And she's got to...

295
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,240
 Look, I've got one advantage over you.

296
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
 I've seen it.

297
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,540
 This is going to be a great sermon.

298
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,680
 So please, next week, come out in force.

299
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:10,080
 Bonnie is going to be preaching on the 25th of June, next Saturday, at White Church.

300
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,720
 I'm excited.

301
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,860
 And then a couple of weeks after, I'm going to talk a little bit about faith and work

302
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,860
 in a moment.

303
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,620
 But Anthony has been working with me as an intern this year.

304
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,580
 He's finishing off his master's in Dallas this year.

305
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,660
 And his speciality is faith in the workplace and linking them up.

306
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,600
 And Antony and I are going to do a two-part series.

307
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,120
 So I'll do the first part and Antony will do the second part.

308
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,380
 So Antony will be preaching here on July the 9th.

309
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,720
 I just really want to encourage you, anyone who wants to know about what it is to be a

310
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,540
 Christian at work is there.

311
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,060
 And then after that, we're going to be doing a series in Ecclesiastes.

312
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,860
 It's a 12-week series.

313
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:56,380
 And I'm pleased to say that we've got Gabe, who's going to be talking.

314
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,740
 He's got the best chapter in Ecclesiastes 3.

315
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
 Go home and read it.

316
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,060
 It's amazing.

317
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
 And then Paul's going to be preaching.

318
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,800
 Now, Gabe and Paul both preached last year.

319
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,360
 They both knocked it out the park.

320
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,860
 Now why are we doing this?

321
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,120
 Because to us, raising up the next generation is important.

322
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,620
 It's more important for us than to have the pastor up here every week or to have a guest

323
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,100
 speaker every other week.

324
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,920
 We really want to do this.

325
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,940
 So please get behind this.

326
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,540
 We've got four of our people at the moment.

327
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,100
 If you think you should be G5, come and see me.

328
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,900
 And we'll keep doing it.

329
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,880
 The next one relates to our talk with Anthony.

330
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,840
 You know, for six weeks now, we've said numbers are being added daily.

331
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,680
 And no one's really said, "Well, where do I go daily?"

332
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,720
 It's not here.

333
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
 It's to your workplace.

334
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,800
 And Anthony and I have a real heart.

335
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,760
 There are people in this church like David Wong and others who have a real heart for

336
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,120
 faith and the workplace.

337
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,960
 So we'll be doing a two-week series after this series, actually looking at faith in

338
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,960
 the workplace.

339
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
 And I think you'll be very, very encouraged to that.

340
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,680
 And we're going to pray for all of you in your jobs.

341
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:15,080
 You know, we really want to encourage you as workplace ministers.

342
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,400
 Next thing is church with a mission.

343
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,280
 And obviously, we want to continue doing local mission trips.

344
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:27,760
 This year has been mainly local mission trips, you know, with feeding the poor and the masks

345
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,080
 and the rat tests and things like that.

346
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
 We want to continue doing that.

347
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,000
 I don't know how Philippines got up there, but we'll start an overseas mission trip as

348
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,680
 soon as we possibly can.

349
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,280
 And Johnny's just waiting to go.

350
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,520
 His leg's tapping already to go.

351
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,520
 That's why he's in the picture.

352
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,520
 Alpha course in the...

353
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:49,520
 I was just going to say, if any of you saw that baptism today and said, "How do I get

354
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
 baptized?"

355
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
 Go on the next alpha course.

356
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,260
 That's the way to start, right?

357
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,800
 So we're doing that in the autumn.

358
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:02,560
 And one thing, if I can mention, Julia has committed herself to KFCI.

359
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,200
 Julia is also a missionary and minister.

360
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,720
 She has a real heart for domestic helpers.

361
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:14,880
 And she said to me and Sandra, she said, "I want to come to KFCI on Saturdays because

362
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,920
 I want to keep my Sundays free for going out and ministering to the Filipino helpers."

363
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,600
 So it registered with us.

364
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,800
 Michelle's got behind it.

365
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,920
 So we're actually going to be looking at how we can reach out to this side of society that

366
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,200
 a lot of Hong Kong society ignores.

367
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,240
 So really watch this space.

368
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,240
 If you've got a heart for a minister, go and see Julia afterwards.

369
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,400
 She said, "Wave your hand, Julia," at the back afterwards.

370
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,400
 And we'll do this.

371
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,400
 But these are...

372
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,440
 I just want to get you excited about what we're doing.

373
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,680
 We're building a kingdom.

374
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:56,400
 But I want to ask you to be part of this.

375
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,720
 You know, I want to challenge you.

376
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,480
 I want to challenge you to be a kingdom builder.

377
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:17,880
 The beauty about the church in Acts, there's no superstar preacher or pastor or evangelist

378
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:26,240
 or there's no Joseph Prince or Brian Houston or anyone in the book of Acts.

379
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:39,440
 Time after time in the book of Acts, we use the word "they" or "all" or "every one of them."

380
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:46,760
 Church is not a place for passengers or observers.

381
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,400
 I'll say that again.

382
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,920
 I believe this intently.

383
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,760
 This church is not a church for passengers or observers.

384
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,200
 You can come once and have a look, but no, seriously.

385
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:11,080
 I want every one of you, every one of you to join me in building the kingdom.

386
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:19,280
 And I want you to do it right here and right now.

387
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,820
 Let's stop playing church.

388
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,840
 Let's get serious and build the kingdom.

389
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,160
 And I'm going to invite Michelle to come forward because she's going to do a little exercise

390
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,880
 with you that I think you'll enjoy very, very much.

391
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,800
 So all over to you, Michelle.

392
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:44,800
