[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.080]   So I have the privilege of standing in for him on this Christmas Eve.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.800]   John, Sandra, we miss you.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.800]   We hope you're well.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.840]   We hope you're wrapped up nice and warm.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.840]   In England it's pretty cold here to be honest as well, right?
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.520]   Maybe even inside this church more than outside, but because of the air con.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.960]   Does anyone remember the name of the first candle that Pastor Johnny talked about?
[00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960]   Hope.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960]   Wow.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.960]   Wow.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.160]   That's a really good, hope.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.920]   Well done, well done.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.920]   The hope of the world.
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.320]   You hear this word quite a lot, right?
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.800]   And I feel as though we've been struggling with this word all these few years, at least
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800]   since I've been in Hong Kong.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.520]   We've just been like, "Oh, this has been such a hopeless situation.
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.040]   Things have just been so hard.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.040]   It's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.040]   And then suddenly now things are starting to kind of ease up a little bit.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.560]   Suddenly there seems to be a little hope.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.280]   So then I was thinking, "Well, wait, actually, why is that changing?
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.280]   Why am I feeling more...
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.280]   Who's feeling more hopeful now than they did maybe one year ago?"
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.920]   A few of us, right?
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.920]   And I feel it too.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920]   I mean, you see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.000]   Macau's opening up.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   That's pretty fun.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.760]   And then you're like, "Wait a minute.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.880]   Why am I more hopeful today than I was last year?
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.880]   What is it...
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.080]   Wait, what is my hope actually based on?
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.880]   Is it based on the restrictions that are decided in the city?
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.900]   Is it my hope actually based on the economy?
[00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.120]   Is it based on how things are going in my life?"
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.120]   That's sometimes how we base where our hope is, right?
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.120]   And the word we use...
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.740]   When we think about hope, I think we actually mis-sell what the word is actually really
[00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.740]   standing for.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.080]   I say, "Look, I really hoped that England would win the World Cup."
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.080]   Wow.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.080]   That's a strong laugh, Charles.
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.080]   That's a strong laugh.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.080]   I really hoped that the weather would get a little bit warmer.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.080]   I really hoped that the markets would go back up.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.080]   I really hoped that the rents would keep going down.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.080]   I really hoped that all these things...
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.080]   And I realized actually the way I use hope often is actually akin to how I say, "I wish."
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.080]   I wish England would win the World Cup.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.080]   And yes, it was wishful thinking.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.080]   But how do you use the word hope?
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.080]   When was the last time you said, "I hope"?
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.080]   "Oh, I just hope that I get to see this person.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.080]   I just hope that I get to see this person."
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.080]   And I think that's a really good way to use it.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   I think that's a really good way to use it.
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.080]   I think that's a really good way to use it.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.080]   I think that's a really good way to use it.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:32.080]   I think that's a really good way to use it.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.200]   What we're saying is, "I wish."
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.080]   I want.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.680]   When we look at the word hope, especially in the Bible, it has a much, much stronger
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.640]   connotation.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.920]   Jesus is not just the wish of the world.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.600]   He is the hope of the world.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.880]   So therefore, we need to understand what that word actually means, this word hope.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.080]   We see in Hebrews 11 where it says, "Faith is the assurance of things hoped for."
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.840]   So what we're seeing is that the word hope is actually closer to the word faith than
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.760]   it is to the word wish.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.980]   I may wish that the weather still is nice tomorrow, but hope is a different thing altogether.
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:17.200]   When I say I have hope in something, it represents something much more steadfast, much more assured.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.520]   That's what really hope is.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.920]   And what we're going to do today is have a look a little bit about what that actually
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.920]   means, what the word hope means in the Bible, because it's not based on external circumstances.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.920]   I can tell you that now.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   That is the final answer.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.600]   It's not based on external circumstances.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.840]   It's not based on the markets.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840]   It's not based on the weather.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.680]   It's not based on which football team wins.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.560]   It is based on something completely different.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.220]   It's based on something that you cannot see.
[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.320]   Because everything that we kind of try to become hopeful with is based on the things
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.320]   that we can see, right?
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.680]   Things that are happening in this world.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.080]   But actually, the hope that is the biblical hope, the hope that transcends time, comes
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.600]   from things that we cannot see.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.800]   And I'm going to do a short little message today.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.720]   And the first passage we're going to look at is Romans chapter 8.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.960]   So if you have your phones or your Bibles, I encourage you just to get them out.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.920]   They're not going to be on the screen because it's just going to be a short little one.
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.540]   But Romans chapter 8, this majestic chapter in the Bible.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.560]   Many scholars, many theologians love this chapter.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.720]   It's their favourite one.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.520]   It's packed with truth that can apply into every aspect of our lives.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.400]   And Romans chapter 8, verse 24 says this, "For in this hope we were saved."
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.680]   For in this hope we were saved.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.720]   And this kicks off three very short points regarding what actually hope is.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.140]   One, the hope in this hope, this is the hope that saves.
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.280]   Number two, this is the hope that waits.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.160]   And number three, this is the hope that lives.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.000]   Saves, waits, lives.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.440]   I'm going to unpack briefly each one.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.040]   Romans chapter 8, verse 24 says, "For in this hope we were saved.
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.680]   Now hope that is seen is not hope.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.100]   For who hopes for what he sees?"
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.800]   So this hope that we're talking about is one that can actually save us.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.520]   This isn't just wishful thinking just to have our lives to be more comfortable to the way
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.840]   that we want them to be.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.680]   But this is the hope that actually saves us.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.520]   The apostle Paul talks about this in Ephesians chapter 2.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.840]   He says, "You had no hope.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.560]   You were separated from Christ.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.800]   You were alienated.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.880]   You were strangers.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.880]   You had no hope.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.040]   And without God in the world, you were dead."
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.080]   But now you're alive because you've been saved.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.960]   And Romans 8, if you just rewind and scan up a little bit or scroll up a little bit,
[00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.200]   you'll see that from verse 18, what he's talking about is he's saying, "Look, the sufferings
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.840]   that I'm going through at the present time are not worth comparing to the glory that
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   is revealed.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.400]   Creation itself is longing, groaning, eagerly waiting for the revealing of the glory of
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   God."
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.760]   What we're saying here, this is the hope that saves.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.720]   What we're saying is that we are all waiting.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.080]   We all have this hope that one day we will all be saved.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.640]   One day creation itself will be redeemed.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.000]   The whole of creation.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   You me.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.040]   Jesus says in Revelation 21, "When I come back, I'm going to make all things new.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.440]   I'll wipe away every tear.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.840]   There will be no more pain."
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.800]   That's the hope that we're looking for.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.440]   And that is the hope that is saving us.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.200]   And it starts with us recognizing this Christmas that actually we need saving.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.960]   The whole point of Christmas is that we need saving.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.680]   That's why Jesus had to come.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.880]   So it's the hope that saves.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.520]   It is the hope that saves.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.720]   We hear this term quite a lot.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.720]   It's the hope that kills you.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   Right?
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.720]   You hear that.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.280]   There's people telling you, "Stop hoping for things."
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.620]   But what they're saying is actually it's the wish that kills you.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.720]   When you keep wishing for these things, it's not going to happen because life is all about
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   disappointment.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.680]   Life is all about handling those disappointments.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.860]   So that's when they say it's the hope that kills you.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:56.080]   But if you have a hope in something that is actually way more than what this world has,
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.160]   then it's a hope that saves.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.460]   It's a hope that is assured.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.200]   It's the faith that you need.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.800]   So number one, it is a hope that saves you.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.160]   Number two, it is a hope that waits.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.260]   If you carry on, chapter 8, verse 25 says this, "But if we hope for what we do not see,
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.900]   we wait for it with patience."
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.200]   We wait for it with patience.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.500]   This is the hope that waits.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.500]   I'm an impatient person.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.700]   I was just confessing the other week to a group of people that I do life with, and I
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.020]   was saying, "What's your worst fruit of the Spirit?
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.460]   If you look at all the fruits of the Spirit, which is the one that you really suck at?"
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.200]   And I said patience was my one.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.460]   That's the one that really gets me.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:39.540]   And if you look at 1 Corinthians 13 and the list of what love is, love is patient and
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.220]   I can't remember the rest because I can't get past the first one.
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.780]   I'm terrible with patience because I want things now.
[00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.780]   I want things yesterday.
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.220]   And we're in a culture that really does feed that.
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.860]   We had to renew my son's passport recently.
[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.860]   I had to send it back to the UK, and they said, "It will be done very soon.
[00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.700]   It will be done in 10 weeks."
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.380]   I'm like, "This must be going by ship.
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.820]   They must be literally paddling towards the UK."
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.140]   I'm just like, "I want it now."
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.140]   Why?
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.140]   I don't know.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.140]   I just want it now.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.660]   I want to be able to watch it right now.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.660]   I want to be able to do it right now.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.380]   I want to be able to eat it right now.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.820]   And in Hong Kong, that's the worst.
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.380]   And that feeds all my impatience.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:22.060]   But true hope, true hope is one that is willing to wait.
[00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:26.300]   Because you know that it's coming, but it's not yet.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.260]   But because you know it's coming, then you're filled with this kind of faith.
[00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:33.900]   You see, the reason why we're impatient is actually because we lack trust.
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.900]   The reason why we're impatient is because, you know, we're like, "God, actually, we don't
[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.380]   believe that you know your timing.
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.940]   God, we think that you actually might be late."
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.940]   Can you see?
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:51.060]   When we're impatient for God, when we say, "God, when is that life goal going to be achieved?
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.140]   When is this going to happen?
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.140]   When is that going to happen?
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.140]   When is that?"
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.140]   What are we saying?
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.940]   We're saying, "Actually, God, I don't trust you."
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:03.420]   So patience is actually a key element to trusting in God, in faith, in hope.
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.420]   It is a hope that waits.
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.060]   So we instead are not filled with patience, not filled with hope and faith.
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:13.300]   We're filled with impatience and anxiety.
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:14.300]   And I've told this before.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.860]   I'm the kind of person that likes to read the Wikipedia plot of a movie before I actually
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.420]   watch the movie, because I find myself getting so anxious when I'm watching these films and
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.220]   these TV shows, watching these characters go downhill, and watching these people break
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.220]   up, watching these people die.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.020]   And I'm just like, "Oh, I just need to know the end already."
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.020]   I'm that person.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.580]   Or maybe last week when I was watching the World Cup final, right?
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.380]   I mean, what a crazy game.
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.300]   For the first 79 minutes, it was all calm, and one team was dominating, and they were
[00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.060]   ready to go home.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.220]   And then suddenly, the 80th minute, within 90 seconds, it's 2-2.
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:54.460]   And then you have 30-something minutes, 40 minutes of craziness and penalty shootouts.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.460]   Everyone who watches penalty shootouts, whether you know the teams or not, you're like, "Oh
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.260]   my goodness, what's going to happen?"
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.540]   Don't we have that?
[00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.340]   Imagine if you went to watch that game now.
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.380]   Would you be filled with the same anxiety?
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.380]   No.
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:13.620]   You'd be like, "Oh, 78th minute, but something's going to happen.
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.740]   But it's going to be okay.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.740]   Penalty shootout.
[00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.740]   Oh, it's okay.
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.900]   I know who wins."
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.420]   That's the same kind of hope we have, because as we look at this book here, we know the
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.060]   beginning and the end.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.260]   And then we should be filled with that same calmness.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.620]   It's like, "Things aren't going well right now.
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.020]   I know they're not going well.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.540]   This Bible tells me that there will be many problems.
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.660]   If I flick to John 16, 33, it says, 'In this world you will have trouble.'
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.860]   But take heart, I have overcome the world, and I will come again."
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.300]   The power of Christmas isn't that Jesus came.
[00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:51.380]   It's that Jesus is going to come again, because this person that came 2,020 years ago is going
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.380]   to come again.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.460]   And that's the end of the story.
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.820]   And because we know the end of the story, we're filled with calmness.
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:59.500]   We're filled with patience.
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.540]   We can wait.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.900]   We can wait for something that we cannot see.
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.460]   We can wait for it with patience, because we know it's coming, because we know it's
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.460]   the end.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.460]   Why?
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.740]   Because there was once a man that came to earth and said that he would die, and then
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.620]   he would rise again.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.540]   And then it actually happened.
[00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:21.780]   And this man, Jesus, says he's going to come again.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.440]   So we have hope.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.440]   And so we can wait.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.660]   And so we can be filled with peace and have no anxiety, because we can wait.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.460]   And we can also tolerate.
[00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:36.460]   As we go through this story, as we go through extra time, as we go through penalties and
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:40.660]   the highs and lows of life, we can tolerate a lot because we see the end goal.
[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.100]   We know that we will win at the very end.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.660]   Right?
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.180]   So if you are an Argentina fan watching that game, you're like, "I'm cool.
[00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.180]   I'm relaxed.
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.180]   Oh my goodness, it's 2-2.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.180]   They're scoring again.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.180]   We could lose."
[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.180]   No, we can't.
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.180]   Oh, I remember, because I've watched it.
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.640]   I know the ending of this.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.380]   This is exactly what is going to happen.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.380]   And you can tolerate a lot of the highs and lows because you know what's at the right
[00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:03.380]   at the very end.
[00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:09.420]   And there's this passage in 1 Thessalonians 4.13 that says, "We don't even grieve as those
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.980]   who have no hope."
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.820]   So what it says is, you can tolerate all these highs and lows, even the very lows, even the
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.020]   lows of losing a loved one.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:23.100]   You can still grieve, but you won't grieve in the same way.
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.100]   Why?
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.900]   Because you have hope.
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:31.260]   Am I convincing you that this kind of hope is very different to the kind of hope that
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.580]   we talk about?
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:42.260]   This hope means that you can stare at death face to face, and you can grieve loss, but
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.700]   you still have an unshakable hope because you know that this is not the end.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.780]   Everything is not right right now.
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.780]   Everything will be all right in the end.
[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.940]   And if it's not all right now, then it's not the end yet.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:55.740]   That is a hope that we have.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.020]   One, a hope that saves.
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.700]   Two, a hope that waits.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.580]   And finally, why do we have this?
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.420]   Because we have a hope that lives.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:09.540]   As I said, Christmas is not because 2022 years ago a baby was born.
[00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.540]   That's not why we celebrate Christmas.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:15.980]   That's not why we have these whole huge celebrations across the city and all these crazy displays
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.100]   in shopping malls.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:21.460]   We celebrate Christmas and have all these things, not because a baby was born 2022 years
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:28.500]   ago, it's because that baby is still, that baby, now God, Jesus, is still alive now.
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.140]   Because this hope is one that lives.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:34.820]   One Peter 1.3 says this, "Cause the living hope."
[00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:35.940]   Why?
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.460]   Because Jesus was born, he died, and then he resurrected again, and he remains with
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.840]   us today.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.700]   We have a hope that lives.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.700]   That's a big deal.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.220]   And we sing about this all the time.
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:53.540]   We hear about it in church all the time, but never let ourselves take that for granted,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.100]   that we actually have a hope that lives.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.020]   He is truly the living hope.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:02.100]   And that is the power of Christmas.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.620]   That we don't worship this cute little baby that once existed 2000 years ago.
[00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:10.820]   No, we worship this because this baby turned into a man, a sinless man, and died for the
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.260]   sins of many, and then rose again.
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.300]   That's why we worship Christmas.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.980]   That's why we celebrate Christmas, because we have a hope that lives.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:26.100]   More importantly, we have a hope that lives in you.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:32.300]   That same power that defeated the grave now lives in you.
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.620]   Through his spirit, Jesus Christ lives in you.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.700]   And I'll give you one more passage today.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.500]   In Colossians 1.27, Paul says this, "There is a mystery."
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.500]   And what's the mystery?
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.540]   "That Christ is in you, the hope of glory."
[00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.580]   Have we heard that before?
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.620]   Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.580]   And I've always wondered, what does that actually mean?
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.820]   If we just briefly go back to Romans 8, you'll see that actually those who belong to Christ
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:00.300]   have his spirit within us.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.780]   You right now have his spirit within you.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.380]   Galatians 2 says, "It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me."
[00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.660]   Do you believe that?
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:15.500]   If you're a follower of Christ, if you believe in Christ, then basically you have his spirit
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.380]   within you.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.020]   And that spirit, he is living.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.580]   He is your living hope.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.260]   Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.260]   What does that mean?
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:32.140]   It means Christ is within you and he brings with him the hope of all the glorious things
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.380]   to come.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.380]   Everything that is to come.
[00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:40.740]   And that's why scripture says, "Don't lose heart, for your outer selves are wasting away,
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.900]   but your inner selves are being renewed day by day."
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:50.220]   What you're going through right now are light and momentary afflictions compared to this
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.740]   eternal weight of glory that awaits you.
[00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.420]   All the trouble that you've had here, all the hopelessness that you've had here, is
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:58.860]   nothing compared to the glory that is coming.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.220]   It is a hope that saves.
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.020]   It is a hope that we wait for.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.300]   And it is a hope that lives.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:11.100]   So let's use the word hope in the way that it's supposed to be used.
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.780]   Have you heard of another one, "We hope for the best"?
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.580]   That is the weakest kind of thing, right?
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.580]   You know, I'm just gonna...
[00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.580]   Students, I'm just not gonna study and I'm just gonna do the exam and I'm just gonna
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.140]   hope for the best.
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.580]   It's a very helpless one, isn't it?
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.340]   But if you're a believer, you can actually turn that one to have something that's much
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.140]   more significant, much more impactful, and much more meaningful.
[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.420]   When you say, "I hope for the best," what you're saying is, "I have faith in what is
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:45.940]   to come will be better than anything here.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.900]   I hope for the best."
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.900]   Another sentence, another quote, "Because the best is yet to come."
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:51.980]   We always see that, right?
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.420]   Sometimes people use that as their email signatures, "The best is yet to come."
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.800]   Because we truly believe the best is yet to come.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.180]   So we as believers, we have this hope.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.540]   It's because we hope for the best, because we know Jesus is coming again.
[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.200]   That is why the best is yet to come.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.260]   That is why we have this hope.
[00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:11.820]   That's what this Christmas is about.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.700]   That's what Advent, coming towards Christmas, is about.
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.380]   Advent, the coming of Jesus.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.180]   Advent starts in the dark and ends in the light.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:26.100]   As he lit each one of those candles, it started dark and it ends light because we believe
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:32.380]   that Christ, the light of the world, the hope of the world, entered into the hopelessness,
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:35.160]   entered into the darkness.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.900]   So we can have faith.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.900]   We can have hope.
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:43.060]   And we can wait, because we know the end is going to be good.
[00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:49.780]   Brothers and sisters, may this Christmas season, may you be filled with a hope that is unshakable.
[00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.360]   May it be much more than just wishful thinking.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:18:02.540]   May it be rooted and grounded in what Jesus did for you and what he says he will do again.
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:07.740]   Let's pray.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.220]   Jesus we thank you.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:17.140]   Thank you that you are the hope of the world and not a weak, wishful, helpless kind of
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:25.700]   hope, but one that is far beyond anything that we can ever wish for.
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.700]   We pray, Lord, that you would instill in us, instill in our hearts a renewed sense of this
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.340]   hope that isn't based on external circumstances, whether borders open up or not, whether COVID
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:40.220]   goes or not, whether markets go up or down or not, whether wars stop or not.
[00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:46.180]   We have a hope, not in anything in this world.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:55.100]   We have a hope, a faith in what is to come.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:59.300]   And may that hope impact every part of our lives.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:08.780]   May that hope lift our spirits, lift our eyes, give us the strength to navigate all the challenges,
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:20.500]   to tolerate all the losses, the grief, the sadness, the heartbreak.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:27.700]   Because of this hope, we can hang on, because we know you are coming for us.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:32.940]   Thank you, Lord, for this Christmas, that you remind us that we get to celebrate your
[00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:39.820]   coming and we also get to look forward to, we get to hope for, we get to have faith in
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.340]   your coming again.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:48.100]   Because of that, we are filled with joy, regardless of anything that we see.
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:48.820]   In your name we pray.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:51.400]   (gentle music)
