00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
(字幕製作:貝爾)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,500
好啦 咁今日呢

00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
就終於可以實體咁樣望住大家嚟港島啦

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
記唔記得我上一次呢 即係兩個禮拜前呢

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,500
係喺咁細喺果度喎原來我發現

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,500
原來我喺果度講嘢

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
即係呢 你個頭都好似唔係好睇到呀

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,500
咁呀 唉 可惜

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,500
咁呀 今日終於呢 能夠返到嚟啦

10
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
即係原來呢 能夠實體返到嚟呢

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
都唔係必然㗎喎 係咪呀

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
幾靈

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,500
能夠實體返到嚟 再次返到嚟個感覺係好唔同㗎

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
咁呀 要珍惜下 要珍惜

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
咁呀今日呢 點解可以著到咁樣呢

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,000
就係 係啦 當然我尊重呢個場合啦

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
亦都係呢 因為我之後呢 要即 即刻呢

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
要去到大人嘅嗰邊呢 就去教浸禮班

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
即係Baptism Class 㗎咁樣

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,500
所以呢 今日就會有啲繁忙啦 咁樣

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
But anyway 今日呢 我哋去睇

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
繼續去睇今日嘅經文啦

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
去睇呢一季嘅一句主題

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,500
你知唔知到呢 我哋原來係有一季嘅主題㗎

25
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
即係唔係月題啦 一個叫咩呀 季題呀

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,500
一季嘅主題

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
係啦 呢一季嘅主題叫做Servant Heart

28
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
咁呢其實我哋由九月啦

29
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
係咪好似由九月開始呢 睇到而家㗎啦咁樣

30
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,500
咁呢就Servant Heart 就係講緊一個服侍一個僕人的心

31
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Ok 咁呀

32
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,500
大家今日呢 我就見到大家嘅Gel度好有好型嘅髮型㗎咋喎

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
係因為大家頭凹凹

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
我哋見到大家嘅髮型呀今日

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
咁呀 係啦 咁呢就Servant Heart

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,500
咁呢Pastor Johnny呢上個禮拜呢同我哋分享咗一個Message

37
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
有冇人記得

38
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
係啦 知道我問呢啲呢就死㗎啦

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
即係一個禮拜太耐啦係咪呀

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,500
咁呢就同我哋分享咗一個馬太福音嘅訊息

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
咁當中佢提醒我哋就唔好去同人增敬

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
唔好去比較

43
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
咁呢 記唔記得呀 嗰個阿媽

44
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
其實就係阿葛同約翰呢個Brothers

45
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
呢個阿媽呢就代佢嘅仔呢

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
就去同耶穌講

47
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
喂耶穌 耶穌

48
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
你可唔可以俾我呢兩個仔呢

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
喺你得著

50
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
即係得國嘅時候呀

51
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
即係你得著皇位呀

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
得著你嘅Kingdom嘅時候呀

53
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
唔係German 唔係Germany

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
就成為你嘅左右手

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,500
成為呢個嘅坐喺你嘅Kingdom嘅旁邊咁樣

56
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
嘩 即係諗諗下呢都幾似今日嘅父母

57
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,500
父母可能走去班主任嗰度同佢講

58
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
有冇人嘅屋企人係咁樣

59
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
同班主任講

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
喂 你可唔可以俾我仔呢坐前啲呀

61
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
佢唔係好睇到呀

62
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,500
或者俾我呢個嘅女呢去做班長啦

63
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
做科長啦等等

64
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
即係呢上次講嘅就係呢個故事啦

65
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
不過呢上次呢個故事就提醒我哋啲乜嘢呀

66
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
就係上帝嘅國度唔係咁熟悉嘅

67
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
唔係咁睇嘅

68
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
即係話我哋唔可以去用平時嘅worldly嘅眼光去睇上帝

69
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,500
我哋有一個字好好嘅就叫做Counter-Cultural

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,500
咁呀上個禮拜呢Pastor Johnny同我哋分享

71
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
唔係用熟悉嘅眼光

72
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
你要想成為大咩

73
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,500
你會想成為勁咩

74
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,500
你就成為所有人嘅僕人啦

75
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Ok 所以呢個Counter-Cultural嘅觀念呢係好重要嘅

76
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
基本上呢佢係cover成個耶穌嘅教導

77
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
佢生涯嘅教導

78
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
咁今日呢我哋會繼續去睇佢嘅教導啦

79
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,500
耶穌嘅教導啦

80
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
當中呢我哋特別要思想嘅係

81
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Ok 除咗唔好比較

82
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
除咗我哋要謙卑

83
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,500
除咗我哋要係咪so far我哋睇咗好多唔同嘅觀念

84
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Ok 除咗呢啲文化

85
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
抗衡呢啲文化啦咁樣啦

86
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,500
咁究竟佢仲想我哋教會呢個屬靈嘅群體呢

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Ok 呢個Church Community

88
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
佢想我哋要Nurture

89
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
要培養一個點樣嘅品格

90
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
要培養一個點樣嘅特質呢咁樣

91
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
咁樣我哋一齊去讀啦好嗎

92
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,500
一齊去讀馬達福音25章呢兩字嘅經文啫

93
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
好嗎 讀中文先啦好冇

94
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
一齊讀喎

95
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Ok 係啦

96
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
仲有人唔係望住個screen嘅

97
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
好啦預備好啦

98
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
要最大聲嘅Ok 好似頭先Chloe講

99
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
要大聲啲唱大聲啲講

100
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
預備起

101
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,500
天國又好比一個人要出外遠行

102
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,500
就叫了僕人來

103
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:40,500
好啦 今日盡量走嚟後面搵下大家先

104
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
真係咁專心

105
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
一定係睇緊經文係咪

106
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
睇緊手機嘅經文

107
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
好 有邊個睇過呢段parable

00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500

113
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
唔搵你哋啦 嗌出嚟

114
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
佢想講咩呢個呢個嘅parable

115
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
睇下大家記唔記得先

116
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
非常好呀 咁就比唔同嘅人有唔同嘅恩賜

117
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,500
仲有冇呀 仲有冇咩學習或者教導呀

118
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500

仲有冇其他

125
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,500

Ok 即係比你五千

131
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
你就要賺五千

132
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
比你二千就賺二千

133
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
好啦 要忠心

134
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
好易明呀 大家都知道啦

135
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
好啦 咁講完啦

136
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
咁今日唔使聽啦

137
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
呢個訊息就完啦

138
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
走啦 Bye Bye

139
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
係咪呀

140
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
咁呀

141
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Ok 咁呀其實唔係嘅

142
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
除咗頭先以上嘅嘢呢

143
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,500
我哋以往呢聽嘅應用就係好好啦

144
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
係咪 要忠心啦

145
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
要忠心呀係啦

146
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
咁呢就唔好懶啦

147
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Ok 要用你嘅gift and talent

148
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
咁但係今日呢我哋其實再想去行前多步

149
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
我哋再睇深入啲

150
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
特別呢我哋要去諗下

151
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,500
其實嗰一個攞一千嗰個僕人呢

152
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
究竟佢做咗啲乜先

153
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,500
或者佢做錯咗啲乜先

154
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
點解 同埋佢點解要咁樣做

155
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,500
我哋再諗一諗用你嘅aspect

156
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
用你嘅角度我哋去諗多啲好唔好呀

157
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
好啦 嚟囉喎

158
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
咁故事就咁講啦 大家都知啦

159
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
有一個人要離開佢嘅屋企嗰一段時間

160
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,500
因此佢就將佢嘅property啦

161
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
將佢嘅產業呢交畀三個僕人

162
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
好啦 單單呢一句

163
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
如果我哋細心啲咁諗呢

164
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,500
我哋會發現at least有兩個疑問

165
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,500
第一呢個主人係咩人嚟嘅呢

166
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
第二點解佢離開屋企

167
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,500
佢會將一個嘅全副身家交畀佢嘅servants呀

168
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
有冇人諗過呢個問題呀

169
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
係咪呀 佢離開屋企

170
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
要將所有嘅身家交畀佢嘅僕人

171
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
大家諗下 比賽係我

172
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
我呢就出trip啦

173
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
咁我就去咗新加坡

174
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
咁我新加坡呢

175
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
我係會唔會將我嘅身家

176
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
全副身家交畀大家

177
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
冇啦係咪呀

178
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
係咪呀 以為係咪呀 噏頭

179
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
應該啦係咪呀

180
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
更何況我冇乜身家嘛

181
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
咁呢個人有嘛 係咪呀

182
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
咁好啦 係唔會架正常

183
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
點解會出trip我哋會交低個身家呢咁樣

184
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,500
原來呢 喺路加福音ok

185
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
我哋叫佢做一個平衡嘅經文

186
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
路加福音19章呢佢咁樣講

187
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
有一段經文呢

188
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,500
即係講緊路加係同樣記載咗呢個比喻啦

189
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
就係有一個嘅貴族ok

190
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
要往遠方去

191
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
就為要取得王位然後回來

192
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
嗰度呢 呢度呢話畀我哋聽啲乜嘢呀

193
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
佢係一個嘅貴族

194
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
一個嘅nobleman 係咪呀

195
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
即係一個嘅有錢人啦 係咪呀

196
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
咁佢先有錢去分畀其他人㗎嘛

197
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,500
分畀佢哋嘅僕人㗎嘛

198
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
咁呀 係啦 好啦

199
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,500
咁但係第二個問題

200
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,500
就係點解佢出trip佢都要交低啲咋錢畀人呢

201
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,500
ok 點解佢出trip佢要交低咁多嘅錢去畀佢哋呢

202
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
好啦 雖然呢經文呢度冇講

203
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
不過呢原來呢同當時嘅culture

204
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
同當時嘅文化呢有啲關係㗎

205
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
原來呢喺以前嘅時候呢

206
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
佢哋即係你要去出trip呢

207
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
係靠乜嘢㗎

208
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
駱駝啦或者有錢啲嘅駱駝啦

209
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
可能靠隻腳啦係咪呀

210
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,500
甚至耶穌嘅時候呢係行路㗎咋嘛係咪

211
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,500
咁去到跨過啲省呀啲城鎮呀城市呢

212
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
其實係都幾危險㗎

213
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
唔知呢大家記唔記得呢個故事係咩呀

214
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,500
好 大家估下先呢個故事係咩呀

215
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,500
哦 撒瑪利亞人

216
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
係啦 Samaritan

217
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,500
好啦 咁呢呢個人呢

218
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
經文話呢佢係由Jerusalem耶路撒冷

219
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
要去耶利哥呢個地方

220
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
咁呢喺路途上就畀人

221
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
打到半死啦

222
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
咁所以呢其實喺路途上

223
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
當佢出trip呢

224
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
以前呢係好容易遇上呢啲危險呀

225
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,500
咁所以呢基於安全嘅問題啦

226
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
原因啦咁以前呢嘅主人呀或者有錢人都好啦

227
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,500
即係佢出trip呢都係會交低嗰啲嘅property畀人㗎喎

228
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
ok呢個係文化上嘅一樣嘢啦

229
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
咁以至佢哋可以繼續去到take care啦

230
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
繼續打理啦咁樣

231
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
咁所以呢其實耶穌呢

232
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
講緊嘅係按住當時發生緊嘅嘢

233
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
咁按住佢嘅culture去講啦咁樣

234
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
咁所以我哋唔明係正常嘅

235
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
咁佢哋一講就會明㗎啦

236
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,500
咁所以經文喺第15節就話啦

237
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
佢按住個人嘅才幹

238
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
ok畀咗

239
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
ok畀咗一千畀咗五千

240
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
二千一千然後出外遠行啦

241
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
咁樣

242
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,500
好啦但係當我哋再睇呢段嘅呢一節經文

243
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,500
ok我哋嘗試去代入第三個僕人好唔話

244
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
第三個僕人即係攞一千嗰個啦

245
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
因為我頭先話我哋會focus去諗下佢呀嘛係咪

246
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,500
好啦若果你係攞一千嗰個

247
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,500
或許你好快又有一個嘅gut feeling

248
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,500
一個嘅感覺

249
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
就係點解嗰兩個攞得多啲嘅呢

250
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
ok點解佢哋可以攞五千攞二千

251
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
點解我攞一千㗎

252
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,500
當你睇到數字呢就好似我哋學校睇分數一樣

253
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
我哋都會有嗰種嘅感覺出嚟

254
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
覺得唔公平呀

255
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
呢種比較呢成日又彈出嚟啦係咪呀

256
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,500
你話按住個人嘅才幹按住恩賜咁樣啦

257
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
咁點解你憑啲乜嘢覺得我少啲先

258
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
係咪呀會唔會咁諗呀

259
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
有啲人係會咁諗㗎喎

260
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,500
即係佢攞得一千雖然聽落去其實好少呀對今日我哋嚟講係咪呀

261
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,500
但係佢仍然會同人比較點解佢有咁多先

262
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,500
大家都係攞大獎頭嗰三名點解你攞咁多先咁樣

263
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
記得呢我哋喺上去過去嗰兩個禮拜啦

264
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
即係或者我喺上次係zoom講到嘅時候呢

265
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
講過呢唔好比較呢個主題係咪呀

266
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,500
大家都好認識啦好熟悉

267
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
原來熟神嘅人呢係唔好比較

268
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
上帝嘅魚女唔好比較

269
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,500
記得呢我話嗰個翻咗12個鐘工作ok

270
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
12打份工12個鐘同你打工打一個鐘

271
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
攞嘅錢係一樣㗎係咪呀

272
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
全部都係一個銀幣

273
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
咁呀即係我上次想表達啲乜嘢呀

274
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,500
就係話上帝有絕對嘅主權呀

275
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,500
上帝要畀ok畀一個翻咗一個鐘嘅人都係咁嘅價錢

276
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,500
係咪呀係佢嘅一個嘅決定係咪呀

277
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
上帝有權去咁樣決定㗎

278
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
我哋只需要做返我哋嘅職責係咪呀

279
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:39,500
我哋只需要去做返我哋今日所擁有嘅嗰個role嗰個職責

280
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,500
同樣喺今日呢個嘅才幹嘅比喻

281
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,500
我想講嘅第一點就係我哋仍然要放低呢個比較

282
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
點解又要講呢樣嘢呀

283
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,500
因為嗰種嘅比較實在太容易彈出嚟啦

284
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,500
嗰種嘅妒忌嗰種嘅同人compare嗰種嘅感覺

285
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
實在太容易啦對我哋華人嚟講啦尤其係ok

286
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,500
我哋好容易會事無啦

287
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,500
好似頭先Chloe講得好好我哋向其他人就妒忌啦

288
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
向有啲人我哋畀下去就自卑

289
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
點解會係咁樣

290
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,500
點解人哋有五千蚊人哋有兩千蚊點解得一千

291
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
呢種嘅真勁不斷喺我哋嘅心裏面會走出嚟

292
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,500
所以其實我哋再次去睇嘅時候其實都係好㗎

293
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
咁相反我哋要相信啲乜嘢呀

294
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
上帝係真係了解你㗎

295
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,500
上帝今日真係了解你同我㗎

296
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:36,500
所以佢知道點樣按住佢嘅恩賜按住我哋嘅才幹去分配ok

297
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,500
按住我哋嘅恩賜按住我哋嘅才幹去分配talent

298
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,500
分配嗰啲gift each according to one's ability

299
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
因為佢知道我哋能夠承受到幾多呀

300
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,500
講真啦我畀多啲你你係咪manage到呀

301
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,500
呢一刻你係咪manage到管理到呢啲嘢呢

302
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
其實我哋都要問自己

303
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,500
所以今日如果你覺得你自己點解你所擁有嘅咁少

304
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,500
點解你覺得你畀別人畀下去點解人哋唱歌咁好聽

305
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
我以前都因為我好鍾意音樂我成日都係咁同人比較

306
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
好真實㗎喎

307
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,500
我好看重呢樣嘢我就會同人比較

308
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
我盡左力都係渣個人

309
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,500
呢種感覺就係好真實囉

310
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,500
點解人哋有咁多恩賜我哋有咁少

311
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,500
但我想講我哋今日唔好去介懷呢啲嘅事情

312
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
相反我哋要知道啲乜嘢呀

313
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,500
上帝愛我哋上帝真係愛你認識我哋

314
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,500
佢好樂意將呢啲嘅恩賜所謂屬天嘅呢啲嘅blessing

315
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,500
property呢啲嘅財幹去賜畀我哋

316
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
呢個就係第一點

317
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
而喺陣間我哋更加會睇見一樣嘢

318
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
就係其實我哋擁有幾多我哋攞幾多攞幾少

319
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
其實都唔係重點嚟㗎

320
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,500
因為天賦眼中嗰樣嘢唔係咁重要㗎

321
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
所以我哋唔需要比較

322
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
話時話啦

323
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
你知唔知到嗰一千蚊

324
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
你而家係攞一千蚊嗰個

325
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
你知唔知一千個銀紙係幾多呀

326
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,500
其實呢一啲都唔少㗎喎

327
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
一千嗰個一啲都唔少

328
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
我唔知大家有冇發現呢

329
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
經文裏面呢佢其實呢

330
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
有唔同嘅翻譯㗎

331
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
中文同英文係好唔同㗎喎

332
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
英文嘅翻譯係咩呀

333
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
我哋話一千英文係講咩呀

334
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
talents同埋幾多呀

335
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
唔係five

336
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
one ok

337
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
一千係一ok

338
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
嘩冇錯一千倍嘅一一嘅咁樣

339
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
喂你唔好睇少呢個一呀

340
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
呢個一呢talents佢正正呢

341
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
個原文呢即係嗰個原本嘅language

342
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
就係呢個叫他連得啦

343
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
就係talents啦咁樣翻譯出嚟

344
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
咁你原來呢佢價值

345
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
佢係係講緊一個嘅

346
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,500
即係weight嗰個money嘅重量

347
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
ok佢唔係一個幣值

348
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
即係唔係一個嘅現金

349
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
一個錢咁樣佢係講緊個重量

350
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
原來一個他連得呢

351
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500

香港大學即係唔係

369
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
香港大學香港嘅大學畢業生

370
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
有冇呀有冇啲咩

371
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
大概幾多呀

372
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
我當二萬啦ok

373
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
都幾好喇係咪呀係咪呀你唔知呀

374
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
當二萬啦ok

375
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
咁一個他連得呢講緊十六年嘅

376
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
人工即係話二萬

377
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
乘十二乘十六ok

378
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
二萬乘十二乘十六

379
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,500
十二個月再乘十六年

380
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
冇錯啦

381
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
就係三萬

382
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
三百八十四萬ok

383
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
三百八十四萬三百幾萬

384
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
差唔多四百萬啦

385
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
一個好誇張嘅數字

386
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
所以你以為你攞得少呀你攞緊三百幾萬

387
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,500
我想講嘅係你係唔需要去比較

388
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
當你望下你自己

389
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
你唔好望人哋呀人哋可能多啲

390
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
但係你望下自己所擁有嘅時候

391
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
你會發現

392
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
其實呢個主人呢都已經好generous

393
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
你能夠成為

394
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
攞到咁樣嘅

395
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
entrust去攞住咁樣嘅錢呢

396
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,500
三百幾萬呀如果今日咁講

397
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
係一啲都唔少

398
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
係咪呀

399
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
所以上帝好樂意畀佢嘅恩賜同埋

400
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
財幹畀佢嘅兒女

401
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
個問題係我哋點樣去

402
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
托管呀係你點樣去回應

403
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
係咪呀

404
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
返返去頭先其實大家都知道個中心

405
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
但係我哋點樣托管

406
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
我哋真係要去諗

407
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
好快啦

408
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
第二點就係上帝

409
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
所要求嘅兒女就係要中心

410
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
咁呢個係唔難明白同埋

411
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
頭先大家都知道啦咁所以我好快

412
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
咁去飛過去先

413
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
第十六節咁樣講佢話

414
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
五千嘅嗰個嘅僕人

415
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
即刻去做買賣另外賺咗五千

416
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
嗰個攞二千嘅

417
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
又照樣去賺咗二千

418
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
不過嗰個一千嘅呢

419
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
就去掘開個地

420
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
將佢埋床

421
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
即係話開頭呢兩個僕人

422
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
佢一聽到主人嘅吩咐就點呀

423
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
即刻走啦即刻去做啦

424
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
get ready或者佢用佢嘅方式去到

425
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
今日嘅講法呢就係投資啦

426
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
ok 咁幫主人賺錢啦

427
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
咁大家要知道啦

428
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
頭先我話攞住嗰五千

429
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
即係five talents同埋嗰個

430
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
二千兩個talents呢

431
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
其實用返頭先嘅concept係攞住緊

432
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
八十年嘅人工同埋

433
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
三十幾年嘅人工

434
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
頭先嗰個係十六啦係咪

435
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
八十幾年人工同埋三十幾年

436
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
成世唔使休呀ok

437
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
咁但係佢仍然去好勤力

438
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
好認真去看待主人嘅吩咐

439
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
佢好快就賺咗個

440
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500

441
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500

點解可以guarantee賺咁多呢

473
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,500

477
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
佢一定跑得好快

478
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500

看待主人嘅吩咐啦咁樣

482
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500

有咩唔同呀

491
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
除咗顏色之外

492
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
個字眼上有咩唔同

493
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:51,500
見到嘅舉手

494
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,500

即係話啲乜嘢呀

501
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
上帝對佢

502
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
忠心嘅表現嘅回應呢

503
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
係冇同嗰個嘅錢呢

504
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
嗰個嘅amount係冇關呀

505
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
即係你本身你擁有幾多

506
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
恩賜擁有幾多錢

507
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
你賺咗幾多錢其實呢

508
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
都係冇乜

509
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
關係嘅嗰個唔係重點

510
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
嚟嘅個重點係

511
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
上帝要我哋做一個

512
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
忠心嘅僕人做一個忠心嘅

513
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
管家一個steward咁樣

514
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
所以今日呢我哋

515
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,500
睇到上帝當今日上帝

516
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
畀咗一啲嘢我哋嘅時候

517
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
我哋要點樣去take care呢

518
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
你今日你點樣去看待

519
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
上帝所畀你嘅恩賜啦

520
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
財幹啦

521
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
時間啦金錢啦

522
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
等等呢雖然我哋

523
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
好似好熟悉呀對呢個passage

524
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
但係究竟我哋有冇

525
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
好好嘅去到看待呢

526
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
唔單止頭先呢啲

527
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
仲有健康呢

528
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
你嘅身體你係咪一個

529
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
好健康嘅嘅christian呢

530
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
好得意嘅

531
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
我哋christian唔單止講spiritual

532
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
嘅方面我哋嘅身體

533
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
係咪健康呢

534
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
呢一切都係需要我哋去託管

535
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
因為呢啲所有都係

536
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
上帝and trust畀你嘅嘢

537
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
你同我嘅嘢

538
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
因此我哋就好易明嘅

539
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
因此例如頭先咩頭先

540
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Nathan講啦影相啦

541
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
係咪呀worship啦

542
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Chloe咁樣啦仲有咩

543
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
打機算唔算呀

544
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
我唔知啦

545
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
打機就應該就唔係嘅

546
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
因為講因此就係要建立

547
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
教會呀建立其他人建立你

548
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
自己啦可能佢

549
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
打機都建立你自己嘅service

550
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
搬凳啦你做

551
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
ambassador做服事

552
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
我記得上年呢我哋有

553
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
喺團契呢我哋做過呢樣嘢

554
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
有冇人聽過呢樣嘢

555
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
團契有學過嘅舉手

556
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
團契有學過嘅舉手

557
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,500
我哋兩邊團契

558
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Sympathy同埋Barnabas

559
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
嘅fellowship我哋都有學

560
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
用唔同嘅方面我哋去認識

561
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
自己上帝and trust畀我哋

562
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
原來唔單止淨係得

563
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,500
spiritual gift除咗呢啲嘅

564
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
因此呢啲才幹呢我哋仲

565
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
有上帝畀我哋一個嘅好

566
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
特別嘅心智啦上帝

567
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
畀我哋有好特別嘅能力啦

568
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
我哋人唔同嘅啦上帝畀我哋

569
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
一個好特別嘅性格啦你有冇

570
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
去了解下你自己個性格咩

571
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
mbti呀而家有好

572
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,500
多呢啲嘅係咪其實我哋去

573
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
認識自己係冇錯嘅即係

574
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
你唔係拜自己嘛你唔係要自戀

575
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
你要認識自己

576
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,500
experience上帝嘅畀你嘅

577
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
經歷無論高無論低

578
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
嘅經歷

579
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
其實都係佢容許嘅

580
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
上帝畀我經歷過乜嘢呀

581
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
失業啦經歷過拍拖

582
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
有高處有低處

583
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
甚至有人經歷過分手

584
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
咁但係係一個

585
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
遺憾啦係咪但係佢仍然呢畀你

586
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
個經歷可能佢可以祝福到其他嘅人

587
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
呀咁樣

588
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
所以今日點樣上帝用

589
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
上帝畀我哋嘅嗰啲嘅生命嘅

590
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
嗰啲嘅事情我哋點樣去

591
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
take care呢其實我哋有責任嘅

592
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
當中

593
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
如果大家想認識呢個呢

594
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
你可以問下頭先舉手返團契

595
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
嘅弟兄姊妹啦所以上帝

596
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
要求佢嘅兒女嘅絕對

597
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
係好忠心咁擺上

598
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
不過忠心係

599
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
真係要學嘅忠心係咪

600
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
話我哋付

601
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
全力100% 200%

602
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
唔瞓覺或者我哋要

603
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
去到盡呢

604
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
去到盡嘅意思即係我要冇

605
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
條命我都要去到做好佢呢

606
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
咁樣我哋喺團契

607
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,500
或者我哋分組嘅時間我想你去討論下

608
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,500
咩叫做忠心咩叫做

609
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
be faithful

610
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
但絕對代表嘅係我哋要

611
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
去專心去認認真真

612
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
聽天父畀我哋嘅吩咐

613
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
你有冇認認真真去take care

614
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
嗰本聖經呢

615
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
上帝嘅吩咐吖嘛

616
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
嗰本聖經你點樣take care呢

617
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
上帝畀咗你㗎啦

618
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,500
屋企有幾本呀係咪呀

619
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,500
手機裏面有一個app至少

620
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,500
有一個囉佢點樣take care

621
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,500
呢樣嘢呢呢個都係我哋今日要學

622
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,500
忠心唔等於

623
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
我哋好似呢兩個僕人咁

624
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
我哋一定會賺到成

625
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
100% 200%

626
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
亦都唔代表我哋唔會

627
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
lose 唔會蝕錢呀

628
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
都係會蝕錢嘅

629
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,500
不過忠心代表住我哋

630
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
會認認真真看待上帝嘅吩咐

631
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,500
好最後啦咁講埋呢度就完啦

632
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
第三樣嘢

633
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
真正嘅忠心

634
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
嚟自對上帝有真正

635
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
真實嘅認識

636
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
點解咁講呢咁樣

637
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,500
我哋大家去到讀幾節

638
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,500
好我哋讀

639
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
24至到25節

640
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,500
讀英文啦好嗎

641
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
24 25節預備起

642
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,500
came and said

643
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:35,500
(英文)

644
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
ok

645
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
讀到24得啦

646
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,500
所以呢個嘅僕人點樣去看待耶穌嘅吩咐

647
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,500
佢攞住嗰一個talent

648
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,500
即係勁多錢啦三百幾萬

649
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
佢攞住嗰三百幾萬

650
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
佢就收埋喺地底啦

651
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
佢就收埋喺地底

652
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,500
個原因係啲乜嘢呢

653
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
我哋嘗試墮入去

654
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,500
可能頭先嘅比較

655
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,500
可能同其他人嘅比較覺得自卑

656
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,500
定係喺24節佢咁講

657
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,500
佢話我知道你呢個主人係一個嚴厲嘅人

658
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
係一個hard man或者好harsh咁樣啦

659
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
即係好苛刻啦

660
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,500
冇種嘅地方要收割冇播嘅地方要殺種要收獲

661
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,500
即係講緊佢係好不近人情

662
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,500
佢好苛刻到一個點

663
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,500
所以佢咬底佢驚

664
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
就收埋啲錢喺地下

665
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
就收埋啲錢喺地下

666
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,500
但係其實佢講緊呢樣嘢其實係咪一個事實呢

667
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,500
係咪真係咁harsh好hard嘅hard man呢

668
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
佢講緊嘅係咪一個

669
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
即係reflect緊佢真實嘅嘢呢

670
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,500
對佢嚟講可能係喎

671
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
可能對佢嚟講絕對係啦係咪

672
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,500
所以佢有咁嘅reaction

673
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
但係我相信佢對另外嗰兩個僕人呢

674
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,500
就唔係咁樣睇啦

675
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,500
而且如果佢真係覺得呢個僕人呢個主人係咁harsh嘅時候

676
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,500
佢應該要點做呀

677
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,500
呢度話應該點做呀26,27節

678
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:10,500
呢個主人話如果你真係ok你真係知道或者覺得呀你係咁我係咁harsh嘅時候

679
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
你就更加應該點呀

680
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
醒醒定定啦係咪呀

681
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,500
更加嘅小心謹慎去進行佢嘅吩咐啦

682
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,500
就好似我哋對住一個好harsh嘅老師

683
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,500
我哋都會小心少少啦係咪呀

684
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
表面上吓即係唔會亂咁嚟啦

685
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,500
但可惜呢個僕人唔係咁樣做

686
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
佢乜都冇做到

687
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:39,500
連耶穌都同佢講你要將你應該就將呢啲錢畀嗰啲兌換銀錢嘅人

688
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,500
即係話以前管理錢莊呀即係所謂以前嘅銀行嘅人啦

689
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
你都要收少少利息呀

690
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
佢乜都冇做

691
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
畀自己懶畀自己一個藉口

692
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:54,500
所以我哋喺呢個僕人裏面喺最後呢個僕人裏面呢我哋睇到一樣嘢

693
00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:01,500
就係原來呢個僕人會因住佢對呢個主人一個錯誤嘅認識

694
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
一個錯誤嘅睇法

695
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
就會帶嚟一份嘅fear

696
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,500
一個錯誤嘅睇法帶嚟一個嘅感覺呢個fear嘅感覺

697
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
以至佢帶嚟一個唔好嘅行為

698
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
係咪呀

699
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,500
一個錯嘅諗法會影響你嘅行為影響你嘅感覺囉

700
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
你嘅感覺亦都會影響你今日會做緊嘅嘢

701
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
呢個都係好真實㗎喎

702
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:29,500
佢覺得呢個主人harsh所以佢驚所以佢索性唔撈

703
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,500
就好似今日嘅術語我躺平呀

704
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
我點做你都係話我㗎啦

705
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
我點做都係做得唔好㗎啦

706
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
咁我仲要做嚟做乜啫

707
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,500
我諗做父母嘅就可能會好明白

708
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:47,500
今日我哋對天父對呢個做你愛你嘅天父

709
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,500
有冇一個好錯即係錯咗嘅理解呢

710
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,500
係咪一個distorted嘅一個諗法一個perception呢

711
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,500
我哋會唔會覺得上帝話你好霸道呀

712
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,500
你好你都咩都唔做得嘅喺教會

713
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,500
或者喺做基督徒咩都唔做得呀

714
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
咁多規矩係咪呀

715
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,500
做少少做錯少少嘢你又鬧我

716
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
我哋會覺得係咁

717
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
我以前都覺得係咁

718
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,500
覺得係因為驚啦所以我先去serve啦

719
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,500
我要做一個乖嘅仔啦

720
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
即係乖啦係因為我驚啦

721
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
我驚畀人鬧

722
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,500
今日我哋有冇咁樣嘅感覺

723
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,500
有冇咁樣嘅狀況呢

724
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
又或者可能你係另一個極端

725
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,500
就覺得上帝你doesn't care

726
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,500
你唔會care我發生咩事㗎

727
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,500
當我哋慢慢長大嘅時候呢

728
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
我哋會發現呢樣嘢

729
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,500
我哋原來呢我哋有呢啲嘅感覺

730
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,500
呢啲所謂distorted嘅呢啲嘅perception呢

731
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
係嚟自我哋嘅成長

732
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,500
嚟自我哋叫做原生家庭呀

733
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,500
意思就係我哋父母點樣去管教我哋

734
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
點樣upgrade我哋

735
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,500
我哋就會將呢樣嘢投射咗落去上帝嗰度

736
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,500
或者project咗落去上帝嗰度

737
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,500
當然未必父母嘅可能有爺爺奶奶或者其他人啦

738
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
所以呢求神去幫助我哋

739
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
第三樣所講嘅嘢就係

740
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:13,500
我哋要學習要去從實對上帝有一個真正嘅認識

741
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,500
可能你要同其他人去分享啦

742
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,500
或者我覺得你覺得上帝好無理呀

743
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,500
或者好唔明白佢點解會咁做嘢

744
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,500
你要講出嚟或者你同你嘅mentor講

745
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,500
以致我哋可以糾正返正確嘅觀念

746
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,500
當然你睇聖經亦都會可以幫助你啦

747
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,500
我哋呢種嘅錯誤嘅觀念呢

748
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,500
會影響我哋對神嘅忠心

749
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,500
可能呢樣嘢呢可能聽落去有啲心呀

750
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,500
特別對未好完全未serve緊嘅人

751
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,500
但呢個係好真實嘅

752
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,500
所以盼望今日呢個message裏面呢

753
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
我哋學多一點

754
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,500
就係讓你嘅服事呢點樣能夠去忠心呢

755
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,500
就係好好真正去認識呢位上帝

756
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
愛你嘅上帝

757
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,500
以致你嘅服事唔係帶住一份恐懼

758
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,500
唔係帶住一份guilt去到侍奉

759
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
好唔好呀

760
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,500
我哋好快去做一個summary啦

761
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
今日我哋所睇嘅有三樣嘢

762
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,500
第一我哋知道上帝係樂意去到點呀

763
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
去entrust佢嘅property

764
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,500
去entrust呢啲嘅gift同埋talent

765
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,500
畀佢嘅兒女啦

766
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,500
所以我哋唔需要比較

767
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,500
我哋唔需要望住人哋有幾多錢

768
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
唔需要望住人哋有點咁叻

769
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
第二上帝所要求佢仔女

770
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,500
要求我哋就係好好嘅忠心去做好佢

771
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
呢個忠心呢其實好困難

772
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,500
因為講緊嘅係唔單止係你嘅今日嘅學業

773
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
亦都講緊好多其他嘅恩賜

774
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
點樣用你嘅時間

775
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
點樣去take care你嘅健康等等

776
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
係咪呀

777
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,500
而最後一樣嘢比較深嘅就係

778
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,500
我哋要處理好我哋嘅內在

779
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
我哋點樣去睇上帝

780
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,500
其實都會影響我哋會唔會對佢忠心

781
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,500
我哋點樣睇你呢位跟隨咗咁耐嘅上帝

782
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
會影響你會唔會決定去服事佢

783
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,500
認唔認同呀

784
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,500
如果你認同嘅時候我哋都一齊低頭祈禱

785
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:23,500
同時我都請敬拜隊慢慢出嚟預備

786
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:31,500
我哋有段安靜嘅時間

787
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,500
我哋去諗返今日上帝

788
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
從呢一個咁熟悉

789
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,500
咁熟悉嘅一段passage

790
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
去教導我哋啲乜嘢呢

791
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,500
有邊一點你覺得係最深刻嘅呢

792
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,500
係呀過去可能你好好想呀

793
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,500
好想去服事呀

794
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,500
好想去有嗰啲嘅恩賜

795
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
你見到人哋做得咁好

796
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
你好想去求神去畀啲恩賜你

797
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,500
但係有時候當你去做咗嘅時候

798
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,500
你又會覺得點解人哋做得好啲

799
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
你又做得差啲

800
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,500
點解我咁盡力都係做得唔好

801
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:22,500
究竟上帝係呢一刻係點樣睇緊你呢

802
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,500
當上帝面對面望住你嘅時候

803
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,500
佢係點樣睇緊你呢

804
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:37,500
我唔知你係對上一次你咁樣去望住上帝

805
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,500
你去到同佢傾計

806
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,500
同佢有交流係幾時嘅事

807
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:50,500
但我想你今日你再一次好認真嘅去望住

808
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:56,500
去同呢位上帝去溝通去講嘢

809
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:05,500
係呀上帝叫我哋要忠心

810
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
可能會帶畀你有壓力

811
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,500
因為呢種忠心係嚟自於

812
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,500
我哋同佢有正確嘅一個關係

813
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,500
佢唔係要逼我哋要去服事

814
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,500
唔係要逼我哋去到做得好

815
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
唔係咁樣

816
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,500
做基督徒唔應該有咁大嘅壓力

817
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,500
上帝喺裏面係

818
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
佢已經去過畀我哋有真正嘅自由

819
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,500
但係點解我哋今日活唔到

820
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,500
你向神去祈禱

821
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
好呀

822
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:56,500
親愛的上帝我哋同心嚟到你面前

823
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
再一次多謝你畀我哋今日一個唔同

824
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,500
好特別嘅message

825
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
一個熟悉嘅經文

826
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,500
一個新嘅體會

827
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
上帝我哋

828
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
係呀今日你畀咗好多嘅恩賜我哋

829
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,500
我哋有好多嘢我哋可以想做

830
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,500
但係神佬真係求主你先去

831
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,500
去交正我哋對你同你嗰個關係

832
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,500
對你有正確嘅理解

833
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
我哋唔係為咗要榮耀我哋自己

834
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
我哋要show off我哋去侍奉

835
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
我哋唔係為咗別人嘅眼光

836
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,500
去到去到服事去愛人

837
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,500
更加唔係為咗別人父母或者其他人嘅期望

838
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
去做任何嘅事

839
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,500
上帝求你去幫助我哋每一個explorer

840
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,500
能夠對你有再一次有嶄新嘅認識

841
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,500
對你有更加真實嘅理解

842
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
以致我哋嘅生命

843
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,500
我哋能夠真正嘅去到忠心

844
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,500
真正嘅能夠去到take care

845
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,500
愛我哋嘅自己

846
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
愛其他人

847
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
亦都去愛你

848
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
願你隨聽我哋嘅禱告

849
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,500
祝福我哋之後來嘅時間

850
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
奉主命求

851
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
Amen

852
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
將時間交給其他人
