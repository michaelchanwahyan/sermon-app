1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 You

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,160
 Last week I stood here

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,560
 introducing Susanna

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,960
 when I stood here I was

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,960
 69 years of old

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,120
 just

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,760
 Today

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,640
 I'm 70

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,240
 And

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,240
 had six days

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,240
 Something

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,480
 Has changed. I

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,680
 am now in my eighth decade a

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:48,200
 Septuagenarian for those who like long words to put this in the context the same as Donald Trump

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,040
 By the way, I loved the dinner and

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:01,200
 There is nothing better in my humble opinion than a church eating together. Do you agree?

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,960
 and

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,320
 following last week's excellent talk by Susanna I

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,280
 want to talk today about

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,040
 change

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
 And I've called this week's sermon

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
 serving

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,040
 changes me

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,640
 But before I go further let me put this into perspective

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,400
 Serving will not save you

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,600
 I'm gonna repeat that again

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:40,600
 Serving will not save you how we are saved is by faith in God's Son Jesus Christ

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:48,160
 and by accepting the free gift of salvation that could be paid for only by his precious blood

29
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,320
 No amount of good works

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,880
 No amount of good works

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,400
 no amount of good behavior or

32
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,520
 No amount of service

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,640
 Can save us from our sins?

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,160
 But read my lips

35
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:17,120
 We've each been saved in order in order to serve those around us do you get that?

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,880
 Christ called each of his disciples to follow him and he charged them with

37
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,920
 Doing things that he himself could have done in the blink of an eye

38
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,480
 and

39
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,400
 In the same way he will task us you and me

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,040
 With things to fulfill our purpose here on earth

41
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,600
 Remember our theme for this series

42
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,000
 saved people serve people

43
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,400
 And I want to make a very simple point today

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:59,800
 Serving is the quickest way to see change in our lives. I'll say it again

45
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,960
 Serving is the quickest way to

46
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:12,240
 See change in our lives. I want to ask you a rather obvious question

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,600
 Do you want to be more like Jesus?

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
 I've put the answer on the screen

49
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,760
 If you want to be more like Jesus

50
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,320
 Focus more on serving others than being served

51
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:37,720
 We'll be looking later at Matthew 20 28, you know it the Son of Man that's Jesus

52
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,160
 Came not to be served but to serve

53
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,280
 Philippians 2 7 but Jesus emptied himself

54
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,240
 by taking the very nature of a servant

55
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,240
 The best way we can make a difference in our workplaces

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,880
 to improve our marriages those who are married and

57
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,880
 Discover our spiritual gifts is to serve those around us

58
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,400
 Serving is the quickest way

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,760
 to see change in our lives and

60
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,040
 Tonight I'm going to be making four points. Yeah, I know

61
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,560
 Sermon should be three points, but I'm greedy right four points

62
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,560
 First one is this

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,080
 serving increases my faith and

64
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,840
 To make my point I'm gonna do it dwell delve into a well-known

65
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,840
 Story the account of Jesus's first miracle that we know as turning water into wine

66
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,160
 Those of you were here on time tonight actually saying it right Jesus tells the story. Let me read it to you

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,400
 on the third day

68
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,560
 There was a wedding at Cana in Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there

69
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,560
 Jesus also was invited to the wedding with his disciples

70
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,960
 When the wine ran out the mother of Jesus said to him they have no wine

71
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,680
 Jesus said to mom woman

72
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,720
 What does it have to do with me?

73
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,800
 My hour has not yet come

74
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,400
 His mother said to the servants do

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,200
 Whatever he tells you

76
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,920
 Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish rites of purification

77
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,000
 each holding 20 to 30 gallons Jesus

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,560
 said to the servants fill the jars with water and

79
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,920
 they filled them up to the brim and

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,640
 He said to them

81
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
 now draw some out and

82
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,680
 Take it to the master of the feast

83
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:59,160
 So they took it when the master of the feast tasted the water now become wine and did not know where it came from

84
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,480
 But the servants who had drawn the water knew the master of the feast called the bridegroom and said

85
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:14,440
 Isn't everyone serves the good wine first and when people have drunk freely then they serve the poor wine

86
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,080
 but you

87
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,880
 Have kept the good wine until now

88
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,280
 this the first of his signs Jesus did at Cana in Galilee and

89
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,360
 manifested his glory and

90
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,480
 his disciples

91
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
 believed in him I

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,560
 Want to direct your attention to the use of the word?

93
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,600
 Servants it's in verse 5 and verse 9 and as an aside here G

94
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,920
 John uses the Greek word the ocanus from which we get our term deacons

95
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:57,760
 The servants are referred to in several more verses by the words either they them or you

96
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:05,680
 The point is it is these unnamed servants that I want to focus on

97
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,360
 Though Jesus could have filled the water pots merely by his word

98
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,080
 He preferred to use the servants

99
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,720
 That was such a blessing

100
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,120
 Because

101
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,320
 He still does that today

102
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,240
 and

103
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,000
 He wants to use you

104
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,120
 Let's look at it more closely

105
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:43,000
 Note there was firstly the want expressed verse 3 they have no one

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,560
 That was followed by the way explained fill the jars with water

107
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,160
 Then came the will exercise they filled them up to the brim and

108
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,240
 This was followed by the wonder experience

109
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,360
 The water was made wine

110
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,040
 What we've just witnessed here here is a miracle

111
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,160
 with a message I

112
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,520
 Put a quote on the screen

113
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,280
 Evangelist and prolific author dr. G Campbell Morgan once said this every parable that Jesus spoke

114
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,240
 was a message was a miracle of instruction and

115
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
 Every miracle

116
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,680
 Jesus performed

117
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,480
 Was a parable of instruction. I'll say that again

118
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:39,440
 every parable Jesus spoke was a miracle of instruction and

119
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
 every miracle Jesus performed

120
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,920
 Was a parable of instruction

121
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,480
 Here we have a miracle

122
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,440
 That is filled

123
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,000
 with insight into Christian service

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,680
 It started with

125
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,760
 anxiety

126
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
 Which led to activity?

127
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,280
 Which leads to adequacy I

128
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:14,040
 Don't about you I was so moved by much of Susanna's talk last week

129
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,560
 Those slides man

130
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,680
 The Hong Kong rich poor gap

131
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,040
 Those who were living in caged dwellings and I think for me, especially the story of that child

132
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,920
 That was found dead at home after the mother's suicide attempts

133
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,280
 To be honest it troubled me

134
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,600
 It made me want to do something

135
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,680
 To see the deep needs met

136
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,760
 And what I want to do now is look at those three aspects

137
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,880
 Firstly the anxieties that troubled these servants

138
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,880
 Now in Palestine a wedding rather like in Hong Kong was a big thing

139
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,280
 In fact, the biggest thing going on in those days was a wedding

140
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,160
 The servants were troubled

141
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,280
 Because the wine has run out

142
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
 Because the wine has run out

143
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,320
 We find out of wine what

144
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:28,160
 We found out of wine what there is no more wine

145
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:36,000
 Nothing could be more devastating at an Eastern wedding than this

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,440
 The servants were troubled about the resources that were inadequate

147
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,160
 The servants were struggling with what they were to do

148
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,960
 For the F&B to fail was unacceptable as well as inexcusable. I

149
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,200
 Don't know if more people came than was expected

150
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,880
 Perhaps they're like Hong Kong people. They don't bother to RSVP. You know what I mean?

151
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,120
 But the wine ran out

152
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:13,360
 What were these servants going to do this was a crisis situation for these servants

153
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,200
 Everyone was looking to the servants to give them the wine

154
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,800
 But the resources ran out

155
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:30,320
 The servants were troubled about the reprimand that was inevitable

156
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:38,320
 Now a bit of background here in Bible times wedding feasts could last up to a week and

157
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,160
 It was considered a crime

158
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:47,840
 For a host for a host to allow the the feast to run out of food or wine in

159
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,720
 Fact actually one was liable to be sued in a court of law

160
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,760
 Wow

161
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:03,960
 It could be costly both financially and socially to run out of food or wine

162
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,760
 No doubt the servants felt like quitting. I

163
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,160
 mean

164
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,360
 How would you feel they'd given all they had?

165
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,400
 And there was nothing more for them to give

166
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:26,640
 However, I love this verse 5 Mary speaks out in verse 5 some of the best advice known to man

167
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,440
 Mary pointed the men to Jesus

168
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:38,800
 Mary makes an announcement to the servants and it revolved around the authority of God Mary directed the servants

169
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,760
 Consciously to observe his orders without disputing or asking questions. This is what she said

170
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,360
 Do whatever he tells you

171
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:58,320
 Do whatever he tells you that could be our motto should be our motto for life, right?

172
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:06,240
 The second aspect is the activities which tested these servants

173
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:14,160
 Now draw out some wine and take it to the master of the feast. They were not given an easy task

174
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,680
 They didn't just take the water water pots to the taps because there weren't any

175
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,520
 There were no taps

176
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,000
 there must have been a spring or a well somewhere and

177
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,040
 They had to carry water to fill those water pots

178
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,680
 The six stone water jars that were used for ritual cleansing

179
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,720
 The weight of the water alone

180
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:51,200
 Was between 160 and 240 pounds in each jar

181
00:13:51,200 --> 00:14:00,520
 That's well over a thousand pounds in total up to a hundred and sixty

182
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,080
 gallons of water by the way

183
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,840
 That was how much wine there was going to be

184
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,760
 It is worth our attention

185
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,800
 to note

186
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
 that Jesus

187
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,720
 employed the use of the servants I

188
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,080
 Mean Jesus could have filled these pots by merely speaking the word

189
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:30,280
 However, God loves to give us his servants an opportunity to labor with him

190
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,800
 God chose to use the servants to share in the work

191
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,280
 He who is a

192
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,800
 supernatural God

193
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
 chooses to use

194
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,080
 natural men to accomplish his work I

195
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,960
 Want you to consider two things?

196
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:57,640
 Firstly consider the apparent uselessness of Jesus's request

197
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,360
 They needed wine

198
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
 They needed wine not water

199
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,320
 These guys were said why do we need water?

200
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,480
 What Jesus had told them to do made no sense

201
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:21,920
 If Jesus had told them to go to the equivalent of Park and shop to go and buy some wine

202
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
 It would have made perfect sense

203
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,920
 However

204
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,960
 That would have been walking by sight

205
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,560
 and

206
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,960
 Jesus wanted them to walk by faith

207
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:41,440
 What they were told to do made no sense at all

208
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,600
 What does filling pots with water have to do with the need of wine

209
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,280
 They yell no gout well, you know, it's what what's going on here

210
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,480
 They were going to have to trust the Lord with this one

211
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,960
 The assignment of the servants revealed the secret of God's activity

212
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,920
 He was going to work through them

213
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:21,320
 Secondly consider the absolute thoroughness of the servants report response

214
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:26,560
 We read they fill them up to the brim

215
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,480
 Whenever we get a command from God

216
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:36,840
 It is always our wisdom to carry it out zealously

217
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,680
 I heard a story of a customer in a restaurant

218
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,320
 Who once asked the waitress?

219
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,320
 Suspiciously after seeing the menu

220
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,080
 She said why do you call this?

221
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:52,480
 Enthusiastic stew

222
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,280
 The waitress explained the cook put everything he has into it

223
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,880
 That's exactly what these servants did

224
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,840
 The wisest thing that we can do

225
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,200
 Is to obedient be obedient to the Word of God

226
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,080
 to the work of God and

227
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,600
 to the will of God

228
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,360
 The command was draw out now

229
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,080
 Draw out now

230
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,240
 Wow, that was amazing. Remember two weeks ago

231
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:30,080
 Interesting and reminded me of the passage of Jesus and the woman at the well in John 4

232
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,720
 and the third aspect is the

233
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,280
 Adequacy, which thrilled their soul. They were not going to run out again

234
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:47,600
 160 gallons is equivalent to around 800 of our bottles, right? It's a lot of wine

235
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
 The thing is

236
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,760
 When we've done all that we can do it doesn't mean that God is not able to do something

237
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:05,800
 When we've done all we can do it doesn't mean that he has done all he can do

238
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,040
 The servants had exhausted their ability

239
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,440
 But they had not

240
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,560
 But they had not

241
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,560
 expended his ability

242
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:26,760
 In the servants accomplishment we see the secret of the ability of God

243
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:35,680
 We know from the words of the ruler of the feast that the wine that they served at the beginning of the feast was the

244
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
 Best they had on hand

245
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,520
 But it was far inferior

246
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,960
 To what Jesus provided later indeed the ruler of the feast

247
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,120
 Praised the bigram for what seemed to be wise planning. You saved the best wine to last

248
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,880
 And I thought about this

249
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,720
 Jesus always leaves people better off

250
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,120
 Than they were before he found them

251
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:09,440
 Jesus always leaves people better off than they were before he found them

252
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,440
 The governor was amazed at the unnatural keeping of the best wine to last

253
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,440
 But what puzzled the ruler of the feast

254
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,880
 Was actually no secret to the servants

255
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,480
 Think about the world the world offers you a lot

256
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,920
 But what the world does is this the world offers you the best at first

257
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,160
 And then once you're hooked into the things of the world things get worse

258
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,880
 But I believe the best is yet ahead for the child of God

259
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,800
 Grace always operates contrary to nature always leaving better things ahead for us

260
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,640
 Christ was the one to work the miracle

261
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,800
 Yet the servants were the ones who seemed to be doing everything

262
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:15,840
 They filled the water pots. They drew out the wine. They delivered it to the governor of the feast

263
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,640
 Christ pronounced no magical formula. He didn't even command the water to become wine

264
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,960
 What was witnessed by the spectators?

265
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,760
 was servants

266
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,160
 Though the means used were human the result was seen to be divine

267
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,280
 God's ability

268
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,520
 accomplished ministry through these servant servants

269
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:47,360
 The servants were used of God in bringing him glory

270
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,560
 The Lord performed the miracles

271
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,320
 But he used willing vessels to accomplish it

272
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:05,000
 The servants were only God's tools in bringing the miracle of the wine into the lives of people who were gathered

273
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,120
 The servants faith was elevated

274
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,200
 the master of the feast

275
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,880
 Didn't even see the miracle the guests at the wedding

276
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,320
 Didn't see the miracle

277
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,800
 But the servants did I thought this is just like real life

278
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,880
 We're sitting in here on a Saturday evening

279
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,760
 We haven't seen that Johnny's been

280
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:39,120
 With the young people in Titus this afternoon. We haven't seen that young man who who committed his life to Jesus

281
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,360
 I've heard outreach or at Titus

282
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,640
 When he's up there in China ministering to students we don't see it, but she's doing it

283
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,400
 Ken invited Claude who was in Beijing to alpha online

284
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,480
 Real life example, there's much ministry that God desires to do

285
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,680
 But what he desires is willing and available servants

286
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,200
 Johnny's and Winnie's and Ken's who are willing to have their faith stretched

287
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,840
 It leads me to point to

288
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,280
 You're hoping I get there eventually serving helps me discover what I'm made for

289
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:26,520
 Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works

290
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,720
 Which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them?

291
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,080
 Can I remind you we are not saved by works?

292
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:44,560
 But it is given to us so that we can be his workmanship his handiwork

293
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:53,340
 His masterpiece, I love that word masterpiece. I think of the Mona Lisa created by the master da Vinci

294
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
 I

295
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:02,300
 Want to go back to 1995 one of the reasons I'm standing here tonight 1995 I

296
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,500
 Was a businessman we running an Alpha course

297
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,700
 In Hong Kong in those days. It's always live talks

298
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:16,260
 Someone says we would you give one of the talks I can remember the talk. How does God guide us? I

299
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,380
 Was very nervous, but

300
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,700
 Yeah, I did the talk then

301
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:30,700
 Well, hey, I can still do this and next alpha course. I did two talks and next half after I did the weekend

302
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,860
 These little things that we do

303
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,500
 Can lead to something that God is creating in us

304
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,860
 his workmanship

305
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,860
 his handiwork

306
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:47,740
 His masterpiece and that is what Paul meant

307
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:53,300
 Peter also in 1 Peter 4 10 as each of us each has received a gift

308
00:23:53,300 --> 00:24:01,060
 Use it to serve one another as good stewards of God's varied grace

309
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,220
 my friend you

310
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,100
 Have been gifted by God

311
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,780
 And I incredibly valuable to him and the church

312
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,580
 Let's move on to point three serving ads connection

313
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,900
 People describe what you're sitting through now as

314
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,180
 the English service

315
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,940
 I'll be honest with you. I've never wanted to run an

316
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,420
 English service I've always wanted to see

317
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,300
 this as family

318
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:43,700
 Rather than just a church service. It's why I'm passionate about our clans and our other small group activities

319
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,460
 Look at our music team. They don't just play instruments together

320
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,340
 Paul runs it as a family

321
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,820
 They laugh together cry together do life together

322
00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:00,940
 Serving on a mission team is another great example. You go out on a mission team and you come back as family

323
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,980
 People I've been on mission teams with have become friends for life. I

324
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,580
 Guess what I'm saying is that serving together?

325
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,380
 Changes the person who's sitting into the next row

326
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,180
 to a colleague

327
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
 to a friend

328
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,220
 to someone we can do life with

329
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:28,260
 If I may use the Hong Kong example of property such a hot topic here

330
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,980
 When we make connections

331
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,300
 We move from being a guest in the house

332
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,420
 to a tenant

333
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,760
 To an owner a guest says I really love your church

334
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,820
 Tenant says I really love our church

335
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,820
 The owner says I really love my church

336
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:57,260
 I want each one of you to know that you matter you can say to yourself. I matter

337
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,700
 You don't feel like you you matter when you're just one of the crowd

338
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:10,740
 But you move from showing up to making yourself available

339
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:20,180
 And that's why I've called every one of us to be involved in this peace box initiative

340
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:25,140
 This is not about peace boxes

341
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,500
 It's about connection

342
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,540
 Which leads me to my point for my last point?

343
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,940
 Serving changes my focus

344
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,220
 The next passage I'm going to read is a key passage for our whole series

345
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,620
 Matthew 20 but Jesus called them to him and said

346
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:55,340
 You know the rulers of the Gentiles lord over them and their great ones exercise authority over them

347
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,380
 It shall not be so among you

348
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,900
 but whoever would be great among you must be your servant and

349
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,660
 Whoever would be first among you must be your slave

350
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:17,020
 even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life as

351
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:19,780
 a ransom for many in

352
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,940
 The run-up of this passage the disciples are angry

353
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:29,980
 Because James and John with the help of their mum wanted special privilege

354
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:36,460
 From Jesus in heaven they wanted the they wanted to be on the top table right left hand side right hand side

355
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:41,100
 Earlier in Matthew they'd argued about which one of them was the greatest

356
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,540
 Rivalry

357
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,460
 amongst the disciples

358
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:53,980
 For prominence in the kingdom set the stage for Jesus's summary teaching on greatness

359
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,060
 But hold on

360
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,060
 Before we're too hard on disciples

361
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,620
 Sober reflection reveals this struggle in all of us

362
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,340
 we often witness in places like Hong Kong a

363
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,220
 Struggle for face for position

364
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,380
 For title and the power and the privilege that comes with it

365
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,580
 even our churches

366
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,580
 the quest for prominence

367
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:32,020
 Frequently lurks in both pew and pulpit the desire for recognition

368
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,420
 often reveals a servant heart

369
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,300
 mixed with much pride

370
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,940
 Jesus presented a

371
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:48,460
 Revolutionary idea of greatness that is not found in worldly aspirations for prominence

372
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,860
 Namely what we call servant leadership

373
00:28:53,260 --> 00:29:01,260
 Yes, there does need to be authority in life's relationships as seen in biblical teaching concerning family church and government

374
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,420
 but

375
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,420
 But when we seek these things as a means for self-promotion

376
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:13,660
 to gain personal prominence and control over others that

377
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,940
 resembles the world's ways more than Christ's ways and

378
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,540
 That calls for a deliberate change of focus

379
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:30,900
 Building on his teaching in Matthew 19 20 that the first shall be last

380
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,220
 the Lord Jesus defined greatness

381
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,380
 using himself as

382
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,340
 the example

383
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,340
 He rendered the ultimate

384
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,140
 servant act of

385
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,420
 substituting himself for us on

386
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,780
 the cross

387
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:57,380
 My prayer is that we as individuals and as a church

388
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,020
 Would be changed as

389
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,500
 We become more like our Lord and Master

390
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,620
 than like the world

391
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,900
 In

392
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,180
 1983 Graham Kendrick who wrote the song shine Jesus shine wrote a song called the servant King

393
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,140
 Will actually sing it in a moment

394
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,060
 But it finishes like this. I want you to take these words in

395
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,020
 So let us learn how to serve

396
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,740
 and in our lives in thrown him

397
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,140
 Each others needs to prefer

398
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,220
 For it is Christ

399
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,260
 We're serving

400
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,940
 And the chorus goes like this. This is our God the servant King. He calls us now

401
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,860
 to follow him

402
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,620
 to bring our lives as a daily offering of

403
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,780
 worship

404
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,780
 to the servant King

405
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,140
 Can we do that? I asked the band to come up

406
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,500
 I'm gonna ask you to stand

407
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,820
 And what we're gonna do we don't often finish like this is we're gonna read a prayer together

408
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,340
 I'm gonna put it on the screen in a moment. We're gonna read a prayer together and

409
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,260
 Then we're gonna sing the servant King

410
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:24,100
 If it's a song that's unfamiliar to you just look at the words, they're beautiful

411
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,940
 But we're gonna sing that together as we finish our service today

412
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,340
 Right, we've got on screen. Thank you very much

413
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:39,620
 Okay, you ready we're gonna read this together one two three my dearest Lord Jesus

414
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,180
 You did not come to be served

415
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:50,460
 But to serve and to give your life as a ransom for me. I love you. Thank you for that

416
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,460
 Thank you for forgiving me when I have a self-centered what's in it for me

417
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,100

 Want to have a what can I do to help?

419

 Because I want to serve you

421
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:13,060
 I'm so grateful that you're making me a masterpiece for good purposes

422

 Thank you for preparing eternally significant things for me. I want to discover what I'm made for I

423

 Want to add connections work side by side with others for a thriving life

 Making a difference for others for now and forever

425
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:39,140
 Your kingdom come your will be done in me through me all because of you

426
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:42,140
 I asked this in your name and authority

427
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,660
 Amen, let's worship together

428
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,660
