1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
 Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,600
 I'm so happy to be here today.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,680
 This is KFC, right?

4
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,480
 Yes, and there are many young people here.

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,400
 Let me introduce myself first.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,880
 I'm Hu Yu-yong, the founder of U4.

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,840
 Young people usually don't call themselves "Yong-ge".

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,840
 But if you're 25 or older,

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,360
 you can call yourself "Yong".

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,600
 We're all the same age.

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,440
 So I want to hear...

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,640
 Because I can't see your faces clearly under the light.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,000
 I want to know who is "Yong" and who is "Yong-ge".

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,160
 I want to know where you are.

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,720
 I'll count to three, and you can call my name.

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,720
 I'll know where you are.

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,560
 One, two, three.

18
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,440
 This side is "Yong-ge".

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,440
 I often go to different schools,

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,000
 different churches,

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,240
 and different jobs.

22
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,880
 We have a space in our workplace.

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,680
 We have a space here.

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,640
 Last time, a team of witnesses came to visit us.

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,880
 It just so happens to be called "The World".

26
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,000
 So when I saw "Come to The World",

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,200
 I felt very familiar.

28
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,240
 It's like welcoming me.

29
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,280
 I can continue to bring the water of life to the world.

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,360
 Here, everyone can meet Jesus.

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,680
 It's like a paradise.

32
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,200
 Today's topic is called "The New Fire".

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,480
 My original topic was a bit of a joke.

34
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,560
 The "New" in "New Fire" is what we originally called "New Fire Youth Network".

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,680
 People usually call it "U4".

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,720
 U4 has a special feature, which is "fast".

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,880
 So I talk very fast.

38
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,840
 Can you keep up with me?

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,640
 I want to cooperate with everyone.

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,080
 I don't need to be so sincere.

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,120
 So I'm very sincere.

42
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,320
 I speed up my speech.

43
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,440
 And I have limited time.

44
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,040
 I'll talk faster.

45
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,680
 U4 has two core values.

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,440
 First, we want to talk about networks.

47
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,480
 Through different bridges,

48
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,880
 we can connect to many different schools,

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,640
 churches,

50
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,080
 and workplaces,

51
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,240
 and different institutions.

52
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,400
 It's like a four-wheel drive.

53
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,120
 It's fast.

54
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,920
 It's fast on the highway.

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,600
 And we also talk about generation.

56
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,800
 Generation is the generation of the New Fire.

57
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,200
 So the "New" in "New Fire Youth Network"

58
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
 is a bit of a joke.

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,520
 It's the wood under the three fires.

60
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,240
 Many people expect the youth to be useless.

61
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,000
 But when the fire is lit in the church,

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,720
 it's like Moses.

63
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,280
 Even if he has a lot of sadness,

64
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,520
 when the fire is lit,

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
 he will find his fire, his life, and his life again in the church.

66
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,960
 He has a destiny.

67
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,960
 So we hope that the youth can be like this fire.

68
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,840
 The logo of the fire is like the fire of the Holy Spirit.

69
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,760
 It's lit.

70
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,280
 And then you think of the four fires.

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,720
 Because the New Fire is also a big fire.

72
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,360
 One big fire and three small fires.

73
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,880
 It's like Daniel and his three friends.

74
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,280
 In the Babylonian system,

75
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,680
 they are still standing for God.

76
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,600
 When they were young,

77
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,480
 when they were studying,

78
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,920
 they were still standing for God.

79
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,760
 They died, but they still have confidence.

80
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,720
 They are not afraid to go into the fire.

81
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,920
 We hope that our youth will continue to burn the love of God.

82
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,280
 This is our goal.

83
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,040
 So we have to cross generations, cross regions,

84
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,680
 cross schools, cross borders to go together.

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,440
 It's been 25 years.

86
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,200
 There were a lot of celebrations yesterday.

87
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,640
 I will continue to watch.

88
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,920
 It's better to watch the video.

89
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,800
 Let's watch a short video.

90
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,600
 Music, please.

91
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,800
 (upbeat music)

92
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,400
 (upbeat music)

93
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,000
 (upbeat music)

94
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,600
 (upbeat music)

95
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:34,600
 (upbeat music)

96
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,400
 (upbeat music)

97
00:03:43,400 --> 00:04:04,800
 (upbeat music)

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,320
 Okay, we've watched the video for only one minute.

99
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,840
 I don't know how you feel after watching it.

100
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,320
 I want you to interview me later.

101
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,680
 I don't want to be on the stage.

102
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,040
 I will walk down the stage later.

103
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,240
 I will interview you.

104
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,440
 After watching the video,

105
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,480
 what did you see?

106
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,920
 What are the characteristics?

107
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,960
 Do you have any DNA?

108
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,720
 I will give you about 15 seconds

109
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,280
 to talk to the people next to you.

110
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
 I will see who didn't say anything.

111
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,240
 I will find those people.

112
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,080
 Okay, 15 seconds.

113
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,040
 Start talking.

114
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,920
 What did you see in this video?

115
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,560
 What atmosphere?

116
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,400
 How do you feel?

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,360
 Okay.

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,440
 I will give you a little time to talk.

119
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,800
 I will give you a little interaction time.

120
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,480
 Okay.

121
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,120
 Five seconds left.

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,240
 Five, four, three, two, one.

123
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,400
 Okay, time's up.

124
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,160
 Okay, I see a couple.

125
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,560
 Yes, they are holding hands to talk.

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,320
 I think they are close.

127
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,040
 Okay, let's interview the previous generation.

128
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,120
 We are a cross-generation, right?

129
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
 Okay, what do you think?

130
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,720
 We think it's very energetic.

131
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,360
 Very energetic?

132
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,520
 Yes.

133
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,080
 What about you?

134
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,480
 I want to ask you if you think the video is fast.

135
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,800
 Okay, because it's energetic.

136
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,240
 Wow, give him a big round of applause.

137
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,280
 Let's interview you.

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,320
 How do you feel about the video?

139
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,560
 Very fast.

140
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,440
 Yes.

141
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,880
 I can hear it.

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,680
 I can hear it.

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,560
 I can hear it.

144
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,640
 What about you?

145
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,840
 Same.

146
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,960
 You are all wearing the same clothes.

147
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,400
 Keep watching his hoodie.

148
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,120
 You know, when I go to many places to broadcast,

149
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,120
 especially the previous generation,

150
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,600
 they say, "Why are you so fast? We can't catch up."

151
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,280
 When I first saw this video,

152
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,760
 I asked my colleagues in the media department

153
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,680
 if they should slow down.

154
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,760
 They said, "Brother Yong, you are fast."

155
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
 "You are fast."

156
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,560
 "If you don't speed up, people will be confused."

157
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,720
 "It's the same."

158
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,920
 So, it's not about what you see,

159
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,040
 but what you feel.

160
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,720
 This is an era of sensibility.

161
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
 So, they feel energetic,

162
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,920
 and there are many things to interact with.

163
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,240
 It's like they want to participate.

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,360
 This is the atmosphere.

165
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,280
 People will stop watching after a minute.

166
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,680
 You can think of it as an ad.

167
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,560
 It's good.

168
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,840
 So, the previous generation

169
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,400
 would slow down

170
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,760
 and the next generation would think,

171
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,800
 "No, you can't catch up."

172
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,960
 So, the speed of the two generations is different.

173
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,120
 Our expressions are different.

174
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,520
 We have many adjustments.

175
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,080
 So, I'm willing to go with the young.

176
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
 So, you go out.

177
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,040
 We'll go in the middle.

178
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,080
 Why is this?

179
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,040
 It's not this.

180
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,000
 Why is this?

181
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,320
 Okay.

182
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,200
 It's an ad for the video.

183
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,880
 Sorry.

184
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,160
 Okay.

185
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,960
 Let's keep watching.

186
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
 Today, I want to talk about

187
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,160
 "The Legend of the Three-Line Poetry."

188
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,240
 Let's read this sentence together.

189
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
 One, two, three.

190
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,760
 "The day of the great and great is yet to come.

191
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,480
 I will not be able to see the day before.

192
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,880
 Where are you going?

193
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,520
 The heart of a father must turn to his daughter,

194
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
 and the heart of a daughter to her father,

195
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,520
 lest I should come and help the land."

196
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,240
 This is Malachi 4, 5-6.

197
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,320
 It's also the last verse

198
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
 in the Old Testament.

199
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,960
 This is a very important message

200
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,480
 in the Bible.

201
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,480
 Since we need to talk about the meaning behind the message,

202
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,760
 we need to talk about the background of the Malachi 4.

203
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,120
 It's a big era.

204
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,360
 There are many internal and external troubles.

205
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,760
 In the middle,

206
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,800
 the people who were exiled and then returned

207
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,360
 started to rebuild the temple.

208
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,680
 There were many internal moral problems.

209
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,120
 They started to fail.

210
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,920
 There were many religious problems in the society.

211
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,320
 Everyone couldn't stand it.

212
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,040
 But there were many complaints.

213
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,600
 The Jews experienced external difficulties.

214
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,000
 The pressure from the outside world and the economic situation

215
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
 caused many disturbances.

216
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,080
 So they thought, "Why would God make me come here?

217
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,720
 Why would God make me come here

218
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,800
 when I was watching the injustice?

219
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,880
 Many people used their self-centeredness to talk to God.

220
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,120
 In the political world,

221
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,080
 in the Persian dynasty,

222
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,160
 in the ruling environment,

223
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,400
 everyone was unstable.

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,080
 The policy changed at any time.

225
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,240
 It's like in this era,

226
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,240
 the international situation is suddenly...

227
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,720
 In the international affairs,

228
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,880
 the country must attack the people.

229
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,360
 Even if it's not just a fire,

230
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,960
 there are many economic conflicts.

231
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,880
 In the era of AI,

232
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,160
 everyone is very nervous.

233
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,520
 We are living in a big era.

234
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,200
 In the middle,

235
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,960
 you can see the importance of God.

236
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,040
 When facing many questions,

237
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,840
 He chooses to be patient

238
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,240
 and constantly talk to His people.

239
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,640
 He constantly tries to solve the problems

240
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,680
 and solve the knots in their hearts.

241
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,720
 At the same time, He gives some instructions

242
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,480
 and even teaches them.

243
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,920
 We can see the need for spiritual restoration.

244
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,920
 We need to return to the temple.

245
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,480
 So in the Bible,

246
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,520
 we need to turn our father's heart

247
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,520
 into our daughter's heart

248
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,280
 and our daughter's heart into our father's heart.

249
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,560
 There are two meanings.

250
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,280
 Father means God.

251
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,120
 We need to return to God.

252
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,280
 As God's daughter,

253
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,160
 God's children,

254
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,680
 we need to return to God's original law.

255
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,080
 He said it earlier.

256
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,480
 In the Bible,

257
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
 "When you abandon me,

258
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,960
 when you leave the teaching,

259
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,440
 you will be saved."

260
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,600
 That's the meaning.

261
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,840
 And there is a second meaning.

262
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:58,120
 We need to choose to be with our parents.

263
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,360
 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob

264
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,200
 were the herdsmen in the middle.

265
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,440
 David was the herdsman

266
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,320
 when he was built in the middle of the kingdom.

267
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,040
 We need to be with our parents.

268
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
 We need to return to God.

269
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,640
 How did they follow God?

270
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,440
 That's the root.

271
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,920
 We need to return to God.

272
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,000
 So that we won't be in the middle of the crowd.

273
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,840
 So this is a call to the heart.

274
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,760
 And then,

275
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,800
 there is the old covenant.

276
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,920
 It's also the situation of the new covenant.

277
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,600
 There is a man named John the Baptist.

278
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,680
 He was described as Elijah.

279
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,480
 And in the Old Covenant,

280
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,800
 he was following Jesus.

281
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,160
 Jesus didn't say anything for 400-500 years.

282
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,360
 He didn't speak the word of God.

283
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,840
 He was very dry inside.

284
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,480
 So he wanted to see if there was any inspiration.

285
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,960
 If there was anyone who could lead us

286
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,000
 to leave the wilderness.

287
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,800
 And who was Elijah in the wilderness?

288
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,480
 Many times,

289
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,600
 the Old Covenant describes him like this.

290
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,760
 He must have the heart and ability of Elijah.

291
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,160
 He was walking in front of the Lord.

292
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,720
 He called for the heart to turn to the ears.

293
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,480
 He called for the people to turn to the ears.

294
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,160
 And he called for the people to be ready to be with him.

295
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,400
 To be ready for Jesus to come again.

296
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,760
 To come to the middle of us.

297
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,800
 So this is also our call now.

298
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
 We need to use a king of kings,

299
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,480
 a king of kings,

300
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,120
 a king of kings,

301
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,120
 in every chapter.

302
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,920
 We need to be ready for this path.

303
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,000
 We are all called to be the voice of the wilderness.

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,280
 Whether it's the New Testament,

305
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,360
 or the New Testament,

306
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,560
 or the New Testament,

307
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,040
 we are all called to be the voice of the wilderness.

308
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,160
 God is also very wonderful in the middle.

309
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,560
 He is the one who puts Elijah and the Lord together.

310
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,520
 God's words and Elijah's work are like Elijah's work.

311
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,560
 The clothes he wears are similar to Elijah's.

312
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,400
 So when people see a crazy man talking,

313
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,120
 it's like they know each other.

314
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,480
 It's like there are people like this in the middle.

315
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,440
 So they are called to the wilderness very quickly.

316
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,280
 There was no WhatsApp or Instagram.

317
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,080
 Why did people go to the wilderness so quickly?

318
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,000
 Because some people look familiar.

319
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,200
 Is it him?

320
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,680
 So everyone is in the wilderness,

321
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,640
 in the wilderness,

322
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,720
 people are everywhere.

323
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,640
 And then line up in the church

324
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,000
 to be baptized by him.

325
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,080
 This is the background of the time.

326
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,480
 Everyone is learning.

327
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,720
 Everyone is not in the middle.

328
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,200
 There is already a place in the middle.

329
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,160
 There is no hope.

330
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,000
 So we have found that in the past few years,

331
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,320
 Hong Kong has not been able to dream.

332
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,840
 We need God to lead us,

333
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,720
 help us,

334
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,360
 and know how to leave the seat of the devil.

335
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,040
 But it's clear that

336
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,200
 if the heart of the Father and the heart of Elijah are not aligned,

337
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,480
 we will not be able to align the heart of God,

338
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,520
 and we will not be able to go back to the people of the past,

339
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,920
 the people of different generations,

340
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,280
 even when we established this church,

341
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,720
 our predecessors,

342
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,720
 our previous generation,

343
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,800
 it is very difficult for us to be aligned in the middle,

344
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,200
 and continue to survive the industries that our previous generation gave us.

345
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,560
 And the Hong Kong Church,

346
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,840
 facing the impact of these ten years and eight years,

347
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,320
 we have to face the reality that the faith generation has left a lot.

348
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,760
 From the age of ten to thirty,

349
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,880
 we rarely see this picture.

350
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,560
 I often go to different churches,

351
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,000
 do you know that more than half of the churches

352
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,040
 only have ten or eight members?

353
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,200
 Some of the believers,

354
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,360
 about one-fourth,

355
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,640
 have to start over,

356
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,000
 start over from elementary school,

357
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,840
 from the faith generation.

358
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,880
 The group of more than 100 people is very large.

359
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,200
 You are a large youth church.

360
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,560
 Many churches are very square,

361
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,040
 the believers are left behind by faith,

362
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,080
 and by the wood,

363
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,360
 even the leaders and the leaders of the wood-raising youth have left.

364
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,720
 Many of my friends have left,

365
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,320
 because they have been walking in the江湖 for so long,

366
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,840
 and have met many different youth pastors.

367
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,720
 They have no choice,

368
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,080
 because their children are very young,

369
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,800
 so they have the opportunity to think about what to do next.

370
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,480
 And you see the immigration era,

371
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,320
 the unemployment era,

372
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,480
 the political situation is unstable,

373
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,320
 the pandemic has a lot of impact.

374
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,880
 We have started to disconnect,

375
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,320
 and there is a big gap between people.

376
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,560
 I don't know if you have communicated,

377
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,720
 it has been a few years,

378
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,600
 people are beginning to feel that communication is an obstacle,

379
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,440
 there is a social fear,

380
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,800
 many times they wear masks and are afraid to see people.

381
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,520
 This is the state we have to face in this era,

382
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,720
 this state of challenge.

383
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,600
 And what will happen to Hong Kong?

384
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,680
 Many young people,

385
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,960
 even those with a degree,

386
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,160
 have chosen to jump into the church.

387
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,680
 Last week, I had a chat with a principal,

388
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,080
 he said the school was under a lot of pressure,

389
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,120
 and was very nervous.

390
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,320
 Suddenly, a person disappeared in the classroom,

391
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,600
 and everyone was looking for him,

392
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,440
 and they were all fighting,

393
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,280
 but they couldn't find him.

394
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,760
 Who knew he went to the toilet to poop?

395
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,280
 The disappearance of the principal for 10 minutes,

396
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,800
 shocked the whole school.

397
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,880
 But what was the feeling?

398
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,920
 Very alert,

399
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,120
 very sensitive.

400
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
 Some teachers in the school are very stressed,

401
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,520
 recently, a girl was cutting her hand in the classroom,

402
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,160
 and she had to deal with the blood.

403
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,640
 She went home every day,

404
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,400
 and she repeated this scene when she was sleeping.

405
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,080
 She was the only one who was helpless.

406
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,720
 I want to say,

407
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,120
 it's not just the students who are stressed,

408
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,160
 but also the teachers.

409
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,720
 Many of them jumped up,

410
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,960
 and wanted to pull her closer.

411
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,680
 Those in the first year of the class,

412
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,840
 they were under a lot of pressure,

413
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,600
 and there were a lot of comparisons.

414
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,800
 Even if I was in the top 10,

415
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,240
 I felt very unsatisfied,

416
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,240
 and I was not good enough.

417
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,200
 But in the second and third year,

418
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,360
 there were a lot of SENs,

419
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,000
 and a lot of families broke up.

420
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,680
 We found that the whole school,

421
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,360
 the next generation,

422
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,400
 was facing a big impact.

423
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,880
 I don't know if you feel the same way.

424
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,080
 A lot of comparisons,

425
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,200
 a lot of differences,

426
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,120
 a lot of competition,

427
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,240
 which made us feel lost.

428
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,400
 How do we solve this problem?

429
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,320
 We see that

430
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,760
 everyone has different opinions.

431
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,400
 So when there are a lot of disputes,

432
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,560
 we are disconnected.

433
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,600
 And death is a total disconnect.

434
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,480
 So I don't know if you feel a lot of pressure.

435
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,520
 We have a lot of contradictions in our generation.

436
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,200
 One of them is the point of view.

437
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,840
 A lot of opinions are different,

438
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,280
 a lot of opinions are mixed.

439
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,240
 It depends on the situation.

440
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,160
 It depends on how we look at the situation.

441
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,240
 Whether we support Islam or not,

442
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,200
 we have a long time to argue.

443
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,240
 So we often

444
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,960
 stand in such contradictions.

445
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,560
 One day, the Buddha asked me to look at this picture.

446
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,200
 He said, "Do you know what number this is?"

447
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,960
 "What is it?"

448
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,280
 "Well, it's a little bigger here."

449
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,680
 "This is nine. I'm nine.

450
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,480
 I eat more salt than you eat rice."

451
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,720
 "No, I'm six."

452
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,360
 "I see this,

453
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,000
 I have a different view."

454
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,280
 Everyone wants everyone to stand opposite each other.

455
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,760
 And then the following is the conclusion.

456
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,880
 Why are people arguing?

457
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,720
 Because they don't stand in the opposite direction.

458
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,800
 Then, do you know?

459
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,720
 The Buddha told me,

460
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,200
 "Actually, most people look at it this way."

461
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,760
 "Do you know how to look at it from the perspective of the ascetic?"

462
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,840
 "What do you mean?"

463
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,400
 Sometimes, when I talk to the upper level,

464
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,840
 I have to think about it and reflect on it.

465
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,800
 When I went to the inner room to pray again,

466
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,640
 the Buddha said, "This is not a number."

467
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,160
 "It's not nine and six."

468
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,800
 "What is this word?"

469
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,520
 "On the side of nine,

470
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,120
 it's the G of small grass."

471
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,800
 "On the side of six, it's the G of large grass."

472
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,120
 "In fact, everyone is G."

473
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,240
 "Do you know that?"

474
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,760
 "Many times, we are G."

475
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,040
 So we have to look at it from the perspective of God.

476
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,880
 Thank you.

477
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,400
 Give me some applause.

478
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,320
 It's hard to get applause.

479
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,160
 Do you understand?

480
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,560
 I think they are very self-righteous.

481
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,440
 "Do you know that G is for God?"

482
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,040
 "G is for good."

483
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,720
 "Can we look at it from the perspective of God?"

484
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,000
 "Is it good to look at it from the perspective of the tree of life?"

485
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,720
 "Is it good to look at it from the perspective of God?"

486
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,160
 "Can we look at it from the perspective of Jesus?"

487
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,120
 "Where is Jesus?"

488
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,960
 "Jesus is next to you."

489
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,160
 "What do you do?"

490
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,200
 "We pray."

491
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,600
 "We can be one."

492
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,200
 His sacrifice is to take away the toxic root of the fruit of division and division of love.

493
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,600
 To restore our status of "sons and daughters."

494
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,800
 We each look at each other and give love to each other.

495
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,880
 So that people can recognize us as their disciples.

496
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,000
 So that we can give love to each other in our lives.

497
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,160
 To prevent many sins.

498
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,320
 Not to ignore the sins.

499
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,880
 It's that we cover each other in the middle.

500
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,000
 Even to accept.

501
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,680
 Then let him have a chance to return.

502
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,000
 Return to the heart of God.

503
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,760
 The church should be like this.

504
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,600
 So that there is a distinction.

505
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,000
 When the heart of God is cold.

506
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,320
 Matthew 24 says so.

507
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,280
 But there are people who distinguish between right and wrong.

508
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,760
 It should be like this.

509
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,280
 The church is not in the middle.

510
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,920
 Just you stab me, I stab you.

511
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,800
 Stabbing each other in the nose.

512
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
 It's not like that.

513
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,160
 It's to look at each other.

514
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,000
 So can we look at each other in both generations?

515
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 Now it's starting.

516
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,240
 Many times, the tree of life is divided.

517
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,320
 It's you and me.

518
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,440
 I also told my parents.

519
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,240
 "You don't have a gift."

520
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,480
 "Don't peek at my things on Instagram."

521
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
 Many times, we don't want to look at each other.

522
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,000
 We don't want to see each other.

523
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,560
 We don't want to be seen by each other.

524
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
 If so,

525
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,560
 what is the situation of the righteous and the evil?

526
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,760
 When we want to share,

527
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,360
 when some people are looking at each other,

528
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,200
 we have lost the blessing and the cover of our previous generation.

529
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,440
 We see that in the Bible,

530
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,120
 the spirit of God is called the blood of the Father.

531
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,520
 I won't talk about this for a long time.

532
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,280
 But what I want to say is that

533
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,560
 you have to know that the spirit of God is a high-speed development in the Bible.

534
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,080
 Because everyone is AI.

535
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,440
 Everyone has a lot of knowledge.

536
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
 But there is no wisdom.

537
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,720
 And no experience in life.

538
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,840
 So it's too late to wait for him to drink the blood of the Father.

539
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,240
 You will have a spiritual leader when you have a little peace.

540
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,120
 Now your children need to speak.

541
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,840
 Your teenagers need to see the vision.

542
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,160
 Your seniors,

543
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,120
 in English, it means your seniors need to have a dream.

544
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,000
 This is the third generation.

545
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,120
 The younger children can be teenagers.

546
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,280
 Teenagers will let go of their vision.

547
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
 It's hard for seniors to keep having dreams.

548
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,720
 Seniors just wait to die.

549
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,640
 Many times it's like this.

550
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,080
 So can we put the three or four generations together?

551
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,320
 And what is the key?

552
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,360
 You call it mentors, right?

553
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,920
 It's you.

554
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,400
 We start at the age of twenty or thirty,

555
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,000
 and go to the age of fifty or sixty.

556
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,440
 This is your generation.

557
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,360
 Can you put so many people together?

558
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
 This is a family.

559
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,120
 At the end of the day,

560
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,160
 the hardest thing to do is our family.

561
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,280
 If our family is not well managed,

562
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,600
 if there is no good ecology,

563
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,520
 many times our children will be left behind.

564
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,960
 We can't let God's love and God's law

565
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,560
 lead them to the end, and they won't be deviated.

566
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,960
 So the enemy wants to destroy the family of the Holy Spirit.

567
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,160
 In the touch of the Holy Spirit,

568
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,800
 we can recognize that Jesus Christ is the Lord.

569
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,360
 In this scripture, it says

570
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,280
 we must keep the new life and the old life together,

571
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,080
 so that we can have the ability to resist,

572
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,480
 and the ability to expand God's kingdom.

573
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,920
 Then we can have more ability to fill the whole land.

574
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,920
 So we can be steady in the world.

575
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,440
 We see a lot of teenagers who have a lot of objections.

576
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,280
 And here is an example.

577
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,640
 This is my teenager.

578
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,360
 I want to show you the changes in his church.

579
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
 Let's welcome his pastor.

580
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,680
 We know that in the Bible,

581
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
 our parents' hearts are turned to our children.

582
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,040
 Our children's hearts are turned to our parents,

583
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,680
 so that God can help us.

584
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,840
 You see, in Hong Kong,

585
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,120
 there are many conflicts and conflicts in the cross-generation.

586
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,160
 It's like a rupture.

587
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,120
 So it makes us, in this city,

588
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,680
 full of many obstacles.

589
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,200
 So how can we turn the crisis into a turning point?

590
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,280
 Next to me is my teenager,

591
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,040
 his name is Zhu Yin.

592
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,480
 He wants to share with you

593
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,360
 how we can cross-generate the cross-generation

594
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,360
 and sell the things that God gives us.

595
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
 Zhu Yin, please.

596
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,560
 Okay, I want to share with you

597
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,840
 how I get along with my pastor.

598
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,520
 Actually, we first met five years ago.

599
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,160
 He came to our church.

600
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,520
 He just finished his theology.

601
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,880
 Before he studied theology, he was a teacher.

602
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,480
 So we young people don't like him very much.

603
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,320
 Because he has a teacher's personality.

604
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,680
 He has a long temper,

605
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,360
 a low-key and very strict personality.

606
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,320
 So we think that this pastor doesn't really care about us.

607
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,040
 He just wants to control us more.

608
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,560
 So we didn't like him very much at that time.

609
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,920
 But you guys seem to have been playing together since childhood.

610
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,400
 Yes, we started to get to know each other since we were in middle school.

611
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
 And then we grew up together.

612
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,440
 Actually, the church made us into eight young people.

613
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,560
 So the pastor and pastor also care about us a lot.

614
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,440
 He also helped you, right?

615
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,720
 Yes.

616
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,360
 So we thought that our pastor was a bit more strict.

617
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,080
 Why did he change?

618
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,600
 Actually, I have a very good relationship with him now.

619
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,160
 Why is there such a difference?

620
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,040
 I remember one year, I was invited by our pastor

621
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,880
 to join a camp called Holiness.

622
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,880
 It's a group of young people who want to be holy for God.

623
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,520
 But they can't get into the camp.

624
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
 Actually, I remember that time.

625
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,240
 The pastor told me a word.

626
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,640
 He said that the pastor who is now serving me is his own.

627
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,440
 If I don't believe in the person I can see and follow,

628
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,000
 how can I believe in the God I can't see?

629
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,040
 He is not very honest.

630
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,800
 It's like Yong Bo is sitting next to me now.

631
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,360
 I can see him, I can touch him.

632
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,240
 So this is a big reminder.

633
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,240
 Then I decided to reconcile my relationship with my pastor.

634
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,200
 I was very brave at that time.

635
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,240
 Not only me, but also my whole group had to reconcile with my pastor.

636
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,120
 I invited the ten or eight people who grew up with me

637
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,000
 to surround my pastor and say sorry to him.

638
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,160
 Wow, what did you do after saying sorry?

639
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,440
 Then I tried to convince him and try to be with him.

640
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,480
 The first thing I did with him was to serve him in school.

641
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,120
 Wow, that's amazing.

642
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,320
 Becoming his right-hand man.

643
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,440
 When he entered the school,

644
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,480
 he looked at a group of younger students.

645
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,640
 He thought, "Wow, these students are so much like themselves."

646
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,720
 They would still be stubborn, late, and not give in.

647
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,080
 That made me understand the heart of my pastor more.

648
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,040
 He treated us like that at that time.

649
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,680
 He was also tolerant and believed that we could grow up

650
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,280
 and we could make a big progress.

651
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,280
 My pastor continued to love us.

652
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,560
 He continued to tolerate us in our congregation.

653
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,560
 That made me understand his heart more.

654
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,840
 My pastor also made me understand the heart of a father and a mother.

655
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,600
 When the two of you reconciled and turned to your pastor,

656
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,960
 we saw that you had already entered the school.

657
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,080
 You could lead the students,

658
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,800
 and you led the students with the pastor.

659
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,760
 How many people are there in your church from the eight to now?

660
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
 There are 40 to 50 people who are now in the church.

661
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
 40 to 50 people! That's a big growth!

662
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
 It's not easy to see such a growth in this period of time.

663
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,440
 It must be a blessing from God.

664
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,560
 And the students who are in the school

665
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,520
 should be about 100 people.

666
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,320
 So when they went to serve with the pastors,

667
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,960
 there were already more than 10 college students who were in the same group.

668
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,080
 So we really want to see the intergenerational connection

669
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,320
 and the restoration.

670
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,160
 Blessings to the church and to our city.

671
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,600
 Blessings to everyone!

672
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,560
 Okay, so, Ju-Yen has already become a pastor.

673
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,080
 She has already been nursing more than 30 teenagers

674
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,720
 in her own small group.

675
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,200
 You can see that when we went up there,

676
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,800
 we took her away from the security area.

677
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,920
 This is a military camp.

678
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,120
 But the real battlefield is actually

679
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,200
 a place where people are killed in a row.

680
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,560
 We saw that the school was a heavy area.

681
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,120
 Many times, it was getting more and more crowded.

682
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,680
 People were very cold.

683
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,800
 Everyone was under great pressure.

684
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,920
 And when these young people were in the church,

685
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,840
 they were very comfortable.

686
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,360
 But when they went to school with us,

687
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,760
 and we did this prayer-learning program,

688
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,720
 we let them know how to turn the tide.

689
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,840
 In the past 11 years,

690
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,080
 we have brought a lot of college students,

691
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,320
 500 college students from different churches,

692
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,840
 to these schools,

693
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,920
 and we did a one-on-four training.

694
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,080
 We did it twice a week,

695
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,800
 and there was a tuition fee.

696
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,320
 And then they took their shirts in the middle,

697
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,400
 and then went to serve.

698
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,080
 Most importantly,

699
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
 the prayers were very sincere.

700
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,920
 Every day, every time they went in,

701
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,160
 it affected them.

702
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,440
 I remember that there was a group of people

703
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,840
 who went to a Buddhist school.

704
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,880
 All of us who went to school

705
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,960
 had no religious background.

706
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,440
 There were six boys.

707
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,480
 He said that a lot of servicemen

708
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,080
 were taken by the girls in the church.

709
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,640
 So they really wanted to do something.

710
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,960
 They really wanted the church to be a good place.

711
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,440
 So they knew that this plan was recommended by everyone,

712
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,600
 so they came.

713
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,360
 After they came,

714
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,960
 they went in with me on the first day.

715
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,200
 And then we walked around the school,

716
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,080
 and before we went into the classroom,

717
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
 we passed the main hall.

718
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
 In the main hall,

719
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
 there was a Buddha altar.

720
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,360
 The whole hall was this tall.

721
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,200
 He said that he had never seen a Buddha altar in a school.

722
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,240
 "Hey, Yong-ge, there's a long light."

723
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,000
 "I found a wood-burning room."

724
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,160
 They called it the "host room."

725
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,360
 "You didn't know?"

726
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,600
 That's how the Buddhist school was.

727
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,800
 The priest tried to shave his head for seven days.

728
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,720
 The priest went to Changzhou.

729
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,800
 You went to Canberra.

730
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,560
 He said that there was a Buddha festival in the middle.

731
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,920
 So don't not know.

732
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,360
 There are a lot of situations like this.

733
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,240
 So they said, "Can we go earlier?"

734
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,280
 "Let's go to the altar 15 minutes earlier."

735
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,280
 And then they prayed.

736
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,680
 Because I felt that

737
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,600
 these people had never heard the Buddha's voice.

738
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,120
 It was very difficult.

739
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,680
 Many times, when we bring university students

740
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,760
 from the military camp to the battlefield,

741
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,520
 their eyes open.

742
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,280
 Although they may be a little bit of a bully,

743
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,840
 but when they face the three of them,

744
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,520
 they can't do anything.

745
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,880
 Now there are a lot of obvious symptoms.

746
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,480
 And usually those who can't keep up with the progress of learning

747
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,160
 are the basic students.

748
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,200
 No money, no resources.

749
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,960
 They are like a base,

750
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,920
 a base,

751
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,080
 being trampled on.

752
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,880
 The teachers at school can't take care of them.

753
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,720
 And then they are abandoned in the middle.

754
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,200
 And then there is a vicious cycle.

755
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,600
 Confidence,

756
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,080
 interpersonal relationships,

757
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,240
 often go down.

758
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,880
 There are really a lot of emotional situations.

759
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,400
 When these people are in the military camp,

760
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,520
 when they go to the battlefield,

761
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,240
 they are calm.

762
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,560
 Because when it comes to actual situations,

763
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,640
 when they respond,

764
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,880
 we don't have any equipment.

765
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,280
 So when you are in this cold room,

766
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,360
 when you try to fight with us,

767
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,800
 you know what you are up to.

768
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,320
 Do you have a familiar military uniform?

769
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,840
 Do you know how to face the situation in the Senior Campus?

770
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,560
 Almost half of our contact is in the Senior Campus.

771
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,520
 And a lot of Band 3D is one third.

772
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,440
 How do we train them?

773
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,920
 How do we teach them how to learn and motivate?

774
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,800
 We are not just training to make them feel better.

775
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,240
 We really want to see them make a new breakthrough.

776
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,120
 We see that in the past,

777
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,280
 this plan has attracted a lot of parents,

778
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,120
 teachers,

779
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,840
 college students,

780
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,080
 and also a lot of middle school students.

781
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,600
 Their witnesses are evaluated highly.

782
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,160
 The teachers in the Buddhist schools have been with me for 10 years.

783
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,200
 Although they know I have a background in Christianity,

784
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,240
 I still go.

785
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,920
 In the Taoist schools, we go.

786
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,040
 In the Catholic schools, we go.

787
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,840
 In the Catholic schools, we go.

788
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,640
 In short, we go in without permission.

789
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,960
 There is a school that gives us from 30 to 100 people.

790
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,280
 Because there is a great need for harmony.

791
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,520
 We see that in the darkness,

792
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,040
 we are the only ones who have the light

793
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,680
 and the power to make a difference.

794
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,400
 Do we have our identity?

795
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,040
 Do we know that we are chosen to be a priest,

796
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:16,960
 a military instructor,

797
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,840
 a saint,

798
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,200
 and a holy finger?

799
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,520
 So after we have regained our identity,

800
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,880
 we try to go to the darkest areas.

801
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,560
 It is too easy to worship and praise here.

802
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,000
 Try it.

803
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 Go to a hall

804
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,160
 and worship and praise together.

805
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
 The people below will be very confused.

806
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,880
 Can you still be able to praise?

807
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:43,480
 I am very grateful to my team.

808
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,800
 I even preach to them now.

809
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,760
 Try it.

810
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,120
 Follow your passion.

811
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,080
 Share it.

812
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,880
 I think Benson is the God of Band.

813
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,000
 That's why he is called Benson.

814
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,400
 He plays everything by himself.

815
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,280
 He also writes songs.

816
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,000
 You can try to listen to their songs.

817
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,360
 Today, he deliberately does not bring his own songs.

818
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,720
 Because today he is not promoting himself.

819
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,400
 He wants everyone to see that he is God.

820
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,680
 So today, I want to say to him,

821
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,320
 "Finally, we only have 5 minutes left.

822
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
 Go for it."

823
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,720
 1, 2, 3.

824
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,720
 I can hear you.

825
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,720
 Yeah.

826
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,200
 Yes.

827
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,800
 I really want to share with you

828
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,080
 what I have witnessed

829
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,440
 especially in U of R.

830
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,400
 Actually, everyone is very young.

831
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,880
 I have also experienced

832
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,280
 being so young like everyone else.

833
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,480
 But I found that

834
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,680
 when I was...

835
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,520
 How did I experience my middle school?

836
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,680
 I had a lot of things I wanted to do

837
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,520
 or a lot of thoughts.

838
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,560
 Is there anyone who...

839
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,800
 There are always...

840
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,840
 What is it called?

841
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,480
 Besides having a lot of thoughts,

842
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,920
 there are also times when you feel emo.

843
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,960
 Is there anyone like that?

844
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,240
 If so, can you raise your hand?

845
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,480
 Oh, maybe you don't dare to raise your hand.

846
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,320
 I want to say that

847
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,480
 in a middle school environment,

848
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,560
 I had a lot of emotions

849
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,480
 and different thoughts.

850
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,920
 But I want to say that

851
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,520
 God's design for me is very special.

852
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,640
 He made me like music very much.

853
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,160
 I also like to play.

854
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,000
 So when I came to U of R,

855
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,680
 God...

856
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,360
 I mean, Yong Ge, he challenged me.

857
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,520
 "Benson, have you ever thought about

858
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,280
 what this generation needs?"

859
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,280
 Maybe what everyone needs

860
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,880
 is not just what we usually need

861
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,440
 in school.

862
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,560
 It's actually about

863
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,320
 how we can take one more step forward.

864
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,800
 God really made us do something.

865
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,080
 What did God make me do?

866
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,720
 It's worship.

867
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,520
 So when I'm here,

868
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,360
 I really want to...

869
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,920
 I really want to show people

870
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,720
 that worship is very important.

871
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,160
 Everyone here is a Christian.

872
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,520
 Worship is very important.

873
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,560
 Worship is a moment

874
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,400
 where you can communicate with God sincerely.

875
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,960
 It's not just about singing.

876
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,600
 So I went to a school

877
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,640
 and developed a worship course with Yong Ge.

878
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,440
 And I wanted to create a band

879
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,240
 with a group of people.

880
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,720
 We wanted to share our original songs

881
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,600
 and messages.

882
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,560
 It's like a little stone

883
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,440
 thrown into a pool of water.

884
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,600
 It creates a chain.

885
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,360
 When you turn it,

886
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,080
 it will spread fire.

887
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,960
 Life affects life.

888
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,120
 But I found out that it wasn't enough.

889
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,280
 What was not enough?

890
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,520
 It turned out that 80% of young people

891
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,600
 are still going to school.

892
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,160
 So what should we do?

893
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,720
 We went straight to the school.

894
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,000
 What should we do?

895
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,280
 One day, when I thought about it,

896
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,600
 I found out that God was telling me

897
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,880
 that everyone has been very tired and painful

898
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,200
 in the past few years.

899
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,240
 Because the worst thing is that

900
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,800
 it's painful but you can't say it.

901
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,600
 Yong Ge said,

902
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,120
 "Why don't we make a musical drama

903
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,320
 called 'Pain Is Not New'?"

904
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,280
 I believe everyone likes to watch shows.

905
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,960
 If you go to Kitee Academy,

906
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,360
 I heard there is a co-play.

907
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,280
 I don't know if anyone has tickets.

908
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,760
 But if we can bring the show to school,

909
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,880
 will it make it easier for everyone to understand

910
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,760
 what Jesus Christ is like?

911
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,760
 Especially when we talk about pain,

912
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,560
 when we can't talk about it,

913
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,120
 what I want to say is that

914
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,440
 do you think Jesus Christ has never been in pain?

915
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,800
 Do you think he doesn't understand you?

916
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,240
 He experienced it like this

917
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,840
 more than 2,000 years ago.

918
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,400
 But he is the God of resurrection.

919
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,840
 So today we can rely on him

920
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,120
 to experience this resurrection,

921
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,560
 to be healed again,

922
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,840
 to regain that life,

923
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,440
 to be rejuvenated.

924
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,120
 So we built this musical drama

925
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,600
 and composed five original songs.

926
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,440
 And we've been to...

927
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,840
 In the past year,

928
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,000
 we've been to 20 schools

929
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,880
 and we've met about 8,000 students

930
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,040
 and led 1,200 students to believe in Jesus.

931
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,120
 I want to say that this is not a given.

932
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,520
 The point is not the number.

933
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,320
 The point is that

934
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,760
 I am a man,

935
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,920
 a man who seems to be very insignificant,

936
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,240
 but God can use me.

937
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,360
 So today, he is not just using me,

938
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,040
 but he is using each and every one of you.

939
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,200
 It's just a matter of whether you are willing to be used by God.

940
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,040
 Thank you, everyone.

941
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,800
 Thank you, Benson.

942
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,440
 Let's give a round of applause to Benson.

943
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,080
 He shared his life story with me in a very effective way.

944
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,240
 In fact, this situation of pain and resurrection,

945
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,080
 when we went to school,

946
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,200
 we observed that many people,

947
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,400
 especially high school students, cried.

948
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,200
 Okay?

949
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,320
 Because they really had a resonance.

950
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,040
 The second thing is that we don't just believe in Jesus.

951
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,600
 Do you need to pray?

952
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,520
 Many people need to pray.

953
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,600
 I need a way out.

954
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
 I have already gone to hell.

955
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,560
 So the teacher and the pastor immediately responded,

956
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,360
 and immediately prayed for him.

957
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,040
 So that he could have an experience.

958
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,520
 So we found that it's not just the stage

959
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,600
 or the moment you're desperate,

960
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,800
 but someone accompanies you through the process of life.

961
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,280
 After death, you will be raised from the dead.

962
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,680
 There is a position that cannot be replaced.

963
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,280
 It is the pastor in the life of Jesus Christ.

964
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,560
 He has to personally let us go through the process of death,

965
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,840
 and he is not afraid of doing harm.

966
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,760
 They have to feel the faith of their whole life.

967
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,040
 It's not just you talking about your faith,

968
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,000
 your witness.

969
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,040
 They have to have a personal liberation of life.

970
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,000
 I tell you, when we go there,

971
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,760
 we are just a small team.

972
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,480
 Our ability is very limited.

973
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,960
 If you like music,

974
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,240
 you can worship together.

975
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,120
 Let's walk together.

976
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,240
 Not just here.

977
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,760
 Can you organize a group of people to go to the mass?

978
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,240
 This is a challenge.

979
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,320
 Many college students start to walk together like this.

980
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,520
 They know it's not easy.

981
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,080
 In the past, there was a gathering

982
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,320
 where we often had college students' DSC training.

983
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,240
 There was a time when the pandemic was the most difficult.

984
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,840
 The political situation was unstable.

985
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,440
 In 2020,

986
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,160
 my son was in the first grade.

987
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:45,960
 And then,

988
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,960
 he just finished his school in June.

989
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,800
 After hearing that we need to witness,

990
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,840
 many college students came to the mass.

991
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,720
 About 50 to 60 people.

992
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,600
 Many of them knelt down.

993
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,160
 They knelt down to respond to God.

994
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,000
 The reason is that

995
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,520
 you don't have to stand in the middle for your generation.

996
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,440
 You don't have to connect with God.

997
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,640
 Can you do this for our generation?

998
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,440
 I called my son to visit.

999
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,800
 He is not 18 years old.

1000
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,960
 I don't know if he can still hear the echo.

1001
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,520
 Can you not just stick to this generation?

1002
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,720
 You are over 18 years old.

1003
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,080
 You even passed the DSC.

1004
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,520
 Can you help our generation?

1005
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,920
 Help us fight a battle.

1006
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,560
 Wow.

1007
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,440
 Many of them were touched.

1008
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,720
 Not just for this generation.

1009
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,720
 What was the most touching?

1010
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,560
 My son.

1011
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,840
 He was the last one to come out.

1012
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,280
 I said, "Son, I call my college students.

1013
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,360
 What does it have to do with you?"

1014
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,520
 "Do you understand what I just said?"

1015
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,000
 "Can you hear me? It's so deep."

1016
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,200
 He said, "No, dad. I understand."

1017
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,520
 And I don't want to just have college students

1018
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,760
 to fight for me.

1019
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,040
 I also have to call my generation

1020
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,760
 to fight for our generation.

1021
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,200
 We have to fight for our generation

1022
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,760
 to win.

1023
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,080
 Wow.

1024
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,080
 I really appreciate it.

1025
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,480
 I held him and cried.

1026
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,600
 I prayed.

1027
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,120
 Actually, calling everyone

1028
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,280
 has nothing to do with me.

1029
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,840
 I can only call my son.

1030
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,320
 He is my second son.

1031
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,960
 He is my generation's generation.

1032
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,560
 He is willing to be a

1033
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,160
 Nasi Iyen worshiper.

1034
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,760
 He started to work hard on his equipment.

1035
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,400
 He wants to play the piano better.

1036
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,760
 He wants to be more like his peers.

1037
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,720
 Last week,

1038
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,640
 he led 100 people to pray in a worship meeting.

1039
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,760
 He started to play the piano.

1040
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,280
 He started to speak out his voice.

1041
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,560
 He said, "I want to pray for this generation.

1042
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,320
 I only need you.

1043
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,840
 I only want to see you."

1044
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,680
 Wow.

1045
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,840
 He and his generation cried out to Jesus together.

1046
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,440
 "We want you to be our center.

1047
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,840
 We want to continue to fight for your country,

1048
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,320
 your will, and your unity."

1049
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,200
 Hong Kong has these young people

1050
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,400
 as our partners.

1051
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,600
 It's not just young people who fight.

1052
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,480
 The previous generation,

1053
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,000
 college students,

1054
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,560
 or believers,

1055
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,680
 you are already on the battlefield.

1056
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,880
 We need everyone to walk together.

1057
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,800
 When Moses was praying on the mountain,

1058
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,200
 Joshua was the only one who won.

1059
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,160
 Joshua, you need to know

1060
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,200
 you are not alone.

1061
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,800
 So when we came here,

1062
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,000
 we distributed our prayer nets.

1063
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 We said, "Today,

1064
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,440
 we will pray for the young people of Hong Kong.

1065
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,680
 We will have a worship meeting

1066
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,080
 and a message sharing.

1067
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,200
 We hope they will wake up.

1068
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,240
 We hope they can connect with God

1069
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,960
 from all angles."

1070
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,720
 We called them to pray.

1071
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,440
 We really want David to fight

1072
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,520
 with his whole life.

1073
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,320
 We also want him to build a church

1074
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,400
 in the next generation.

1075
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,320
 This is a beautiful church.

1076
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,960
 But don't just stay in the building.

1077
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
 We need to become the church,

1078
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,120
 the altar of the flow of blood.

1079
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,120
 We need to become the living altar.

1080
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,440
 This is worship.

1081
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,760
 Worship is life.

1082
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,280
 Worship is not when you are praying.

1083
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,640
 Worship is not when you are teaching.

1084
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,760
 Worship is our life.

1085
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:34,200
 Can we live out God's message like this?

1086
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,840
 Lastly,

1087
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,840
 can you use all your strength

1088
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,200
 to carry the burden of Elijah

1089
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,880
 so that you can face

1090
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,920
 double evil?

1091
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,720
 We need the grace of God

1092
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,560
 from the previous generation.

1093
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,920
 The favor of God.

1094
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,440
 Let's fight together

1095
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,520
 in the Lord's presence.

1096
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,680
 I know we have limited time.

1097
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,520
 Sorry, I have 5 more minutes.

1098
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,600
 But I really want to pray for you.

1099
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,480
 Today, I don't need to call everyone.

1100
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,760
 The key number chosen by God

1101
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,000
 is that one person.

1102
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,240
 To call Jesus,

1103
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,560
 that person can walk into the gap

1104
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,280
 and become a stone

1105
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,680
 to turn the world.

1106
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,920
 But there is a foundation behind it.

1107
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,520
 Jesus came with 12 disciples

1108
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,080
 and followed his path.

1109
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,840
 Then he turned the whole Roman Empire.

1110
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,480
 The whole world turned because of the gospel.

1111
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,240
 So today, if you are willing to say,

1112
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,600
 "Lord, I am here.

1113
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,680
 I know I am the chosen one of your dream.

1114
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,560
 I know you chose me as the priest of the military

1115
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,760
 to stand in the middle of the field to pray.

1116
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,160
 So that when we see the need for the church,

1117
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,200
 we can go with you

1118
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,240
 and our friends

1119
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,480
 to the darkness.

1120
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,000
 We can be the light.

1121
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,320
 We are willing to be the saints

1122
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,080
 and do all kinds of good deeds.

1123
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,000
 We are also willing to ask you to help us

1124
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,760
 to be the saints

1125
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,000
 and be the children of God.

1126
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,320
 We can be united like this,

1127
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,960
 to be united with each other,

1128
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,200
 to be the same generation

1129
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,400
 and to be the next generation,

1130
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,680
 the new generation of the three or four generations.

1131
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,320
 Lord, please fill this heart

1132
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,680
 so that we can continue to be strong for you.

1133
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,280
 Please hear our prayer in front of you.

1134
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,280
 In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.

1135
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:23,280
