00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we're going to talk about "You are adopted". 你是被接受的。

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You are adopted as God's child. 你是被接受為神的孩子。

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
神領養你,做他的孩子。

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
在這個世界,Orphanism 是一個很大的問題。

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
有一個stat在2015就說,There are 15.1 million children that are orphans. 有一個stat在2015就說,有15.1萬名小孩是被接受的。

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Orphanism is a big problem. 孤僻是一個很大的問題。

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
15.1 million 是好像Russia那麼大,一個國家那麼大。

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And fatherlessness, fatherlessness, 在這裡有一個quote,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Never have so many children grown up without knowing what it means to have a father. 從小到大都沒有知道什麼是有一個父親的意思。

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Fatherlessness is the most harmful demographic trend of this generation. 父親性是這個世代最嚴重的民族流行。

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It is the leading cause of declining child and adult well-being in our society. 這是我們社會中的最大原因,是孩子和成長的原因。

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It is also the engine driving our most urgent social problem. 也是我們社會最緊急的社會問題的引擎。

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
If this trend continues, fatherlessness is likely to change the shape of our society. 如果這個流行繼續下去,父親性將會改變社會的形狀。

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is a family researcher from the United States, David Blankenhorn. 這是一位美國的家庭研究員,David Blankenhorn。

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:31,000
In the time of Paul, child immorality was a big problem. 在布羅時代,聖經時期,孩子的不道德是一個很大的問題。

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Maybe the child was disabled. 可能孩子是失去能力了。

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Maybe the child was a girl. 可能孩子是一個女孩。

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Sometimes, the family might have to abandon the child. 有時候,孩子的家庭就可能被丟棄了。

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
In the city of Ephesus, when Paul wrote a letter to Ephesus, 在那裡的城市,布羅寫了一封信給那裡的城市人。

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There was a problem in the city, called "Death by Exposure". 在那裡的城市,有一個問題叫"死亡被爆炸"。

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If the family didn't want the child, 如果那些家庭不想要孩子,

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
they could have this Roman rule, called "Death by Exposure". 他們可以有這個羅曼法,叫"死亡被爆炸"。

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Just like that, they threw the child into a garbage area. 就這樣把孩子丟到垃圾的地方。

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If the sun and heat exposed the child, 如果太陽和熱能曝光了孩子,

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
he would die. 他就會死。

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
At that time, Paul told them, 當時,布羅對他們說,

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
"You are adopted as his child." 你是他的孩子。

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In Ephesians chapter 1, he said, 在一書一書,他說,

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
"For he has chosen us before him, 因為他選擇了我們在他面前,

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
before the creation of the world, 在世界的創造前,

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
to be holy and blameless in his sight. 以他的眼中,無罪無罪地存在。

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In love, he predestined us for adoption 愛,他將我們預定

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
to sonship through Jesus Christ, 子女遷生到基督基督,

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
in accordance with his pleasure and will." 以他的喜好和願望。

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
"神係領養你"。

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
那時,那些基督徒是怎樣? 那時,那些基督徒是怎樣?

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
看到那麼多不同的孩子, 看到那麼多不同的孩子,

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
就這樣被羅曼丟了, right? 就這樣被羅曼丟了,對嗎?

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
因為可能disabled了, 因為可能不適合了,

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
可能是女孩子,可能是不適合, 因為有小朋友是要錢的,對嗎?

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
如果你要錢,可能take away from your social status, 如果你要錢,可能要脫離你的社會的地位,

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
就不要了他。 那些基督徒在那個city,

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
叫做Ethesis,那又怎樣呢? 叫做Ethesis,那又怎樣呢?

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
他看到那些孩子被人abandon了, 他就adopt了他們。

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
adoption是一個很amazing thing, 是兩個parents,

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
一個爸爸,一個媽媽, loving family,

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
adopted an unwanted child, abandoned child,

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
這個picture is a picture of what God has done for us.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
今天我們會看神領養我們, 有三個aspects,

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
第一,我們有一個新的家庭, new family,

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
第二,是一個新的identity, 第三,是一個新的inheritance,

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
第一,我們為甚麼會有一個新的家庭呢?

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
第一,是因為是天父initiate,

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
God initiated it through Jesus Christ,

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
今天我們會讀Galatians 4:4-5

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
及至時候滿足, 神就差遣他的兒子為女子所生,

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
且生在律法意下, 要把律法意下的人屬出來,

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
叫我們得著兒子的名分。

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
在這裡寫, 神把他的兒子生下為女子,

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
以律法下的兒子, 讓我們可以得著兒子的名分。

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
神把我們的兒子領養為他的孩子,

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
第二,我們會看到, 我們的新的family,

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
是through Jesus Christ,

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
God sent his son, 他差遣主耶穌幫我們,

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
去救我們,

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
還有我們看到, 我們的新的family,

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
是我們united with brothers and sisters,

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
這個家庭是有不同的brothers and sisters,

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
我們基督徒的brothers and sisters,

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
brothers in Christ,

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
第一,我們有一個新的家庭,

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
第二,我們有一個新的identity,

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
之前我們rejected,

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
we were rejected because of sin,

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
我們有罪,

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
有罪我們和神的關係分裂了,

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
that now we are reborn, redeemed,

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
and remade a child in Christ,

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
之前我們被罪control我們,

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
we were slaves to sin,

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
但現在我們有freedom,

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
freedom to serve God,

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
去侍奉神,

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
serve God and serve righteousness,

87
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
we are now free to be righteous,

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
在John 1是這樣說,

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
凡接待他的,就是信他名的人,

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
他就賜他們權並作神的兒女,

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
這等人不是從血氣生的,

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
不是從情慾生的,

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
也不是從仁義生的,

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
乃是從神生的。

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
For those who received him,

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
those who believed in his name,

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
he gave the right to become children of God,

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
children of God,

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
如果你相信主耶穌,

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
接受了他,

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
是你的頭子,

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
你可以做他的孩子,

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you are his child.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
第三,我們有一個new inheritance,

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
new inheritance,

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
在Romans 8說,

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
因為凡被神的靈引導的,

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
都是神的兒子,

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
我們所受的,

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
不是奴僕的心,

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
仍舊害怕,

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
所受的,

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
乃是兒子的心,

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
因此我們呼叫阿爸父,

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
聖靈與我們的心,

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
同證我們是神的兒女,

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
既是兒女,

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
便是後子,

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
就是神的後子,

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
與基督同作後子,

121
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
如果我們和他一同受苦,

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
也必和他一同得榮耀。

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
你所受的靈,

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
並不使你成為奴僕,

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
讓你活在恐懼中,

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
讓你再次生活在恐懼中,

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
但是你所受的靈,

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
帶給你兒子的育成,

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
而我們呼叫阿爸父,

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
靈自身與我們的靈,

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
證明我們是神的兒女,

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
現在如果我們是兒女,

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
我們就是後子,

134
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
是神的後子,

135
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
與基督同作後子,

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
如果我們一同受苦,

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
也必和他一同得榮耀。

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
我們是後子,

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
與基督同作後子,

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
我們與主耶穌,

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
一同得榮耀,

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
這個榮耀是什麼呢?

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
一個新的天堂,

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
一個新的地球,

145
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
主耶穌復活,

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
我們有一天也會有,

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
一個復活的身體,

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
我們也會復活,

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
我們一同得榮耀,

150
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
與天堂的寬廣,

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
我們與主耶穌,

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
一同分享天堂的未來。

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
哇!

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
我們說了三件事,

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
神領養我們,

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
有三件新事物,

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
一個新的家庭,

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
新的家庭,

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
一個新的身份,

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
新身份,

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
新身份,

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
還有第三件事,

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
新身份。

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
保羅在他的書,

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
《二法所書》,

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
說我們是他的孩子,

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
問題就是,

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
我們是否在演戲,

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
像他的孩子,

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
我們是否在演戲,

171
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
像他的兒女,

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
不是,

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
如果我們是他的孩子,

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
我們會奉服神,

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
我們會改變生命,

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
我們會奉服神,

177
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
我們會模仿耶穌,

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
我們會變得像耶穌,

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
在第五章,

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
保羅叫那些"Ephesians",

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
做什麼?

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
"The imitators of God",

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
"The imitators",

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
因為你是他的孩子,

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
你要怎樣?

186
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
要模仿神,

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
好像神一樣,

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
是不是?

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
第二樣,

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
他說"Walk in love",

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
"Walk in love",

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
你要走在愛的方面,

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
你也要模仿神的愛,

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
還有什麼?

195
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
他說"Walk not as unwise, but as wise",

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
因為你是他的孩子,

197
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
你要聰明,

198
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
要聰明,

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
"Do not be drunk on wine,

200
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
which leads to debauchery,

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
but be filled with the Spirit",

202
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
給聖靈充滿,

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
你做他的孩子,

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
你沒有給神的聖靈充滿,

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
"Be filled with the Spirit of God",

206
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
我們在華人的文化,

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
是很不同的,

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
和西方文化,

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
是不是?

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
這個亞洲文化,

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
華人的文化,

212
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
是很表演性的,

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
是不是?

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
我知道你們讀書有很多壓力,

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
很表演性的,

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
爸爸媽媽說,

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
為什麼你只有90%,

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
為什麼不是100%呢?

219
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
是不是?

220
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
所以令到我們好像要很緊張,

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
我們的性,

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
我們的表演性,

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
我們時時都要保護面子,

224
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
給面子,

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Hide all your weaknesses,

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
So that people don't look down on you,

227
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hide your failures,

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
在這個華人的社會,

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
是有時很難的,

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
是不是?

231
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
是有很多壓力的,

232
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
我們做基督徒,

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
有時我們transfer,

234
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
我們的Chinese culture,

235
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
into our faith as well,

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
有時我覺得自己要做很多很多的事,

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
去侍奉神,

238
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
然後神才會愛我,

239
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
才會領養我做祂的孩子,

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
一個problem with faith and works,

241
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
你是不是好像這樣,

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
經常做事,

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
希望別人去impress,

244
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
be impressed by you,

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
有時我做牧師,

246
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
都會有這樣的struggle,

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
是不是?

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
如果我傳福音,

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
傳到很多人,

250
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
那神就可能很開心,

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
會love me more,

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But that's not true,

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
There's nothing that I can do,

254
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
that would make God love me more or less,

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
God loves me,

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
and His love is consistent,

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and my identity needs to be found in Him,

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
as His child, as His son,

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
我們如果接受了,

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
神是愛我們,

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
神是領養我們,

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
是祂的孩子,

263
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
那我們不用perform,

264
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
我們不用去教會,

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
因為我們希望神開心,

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
可以讓我們去天堂,

267
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
不是的,

268
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
我們去教會,

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
不是去pleased,

270
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Hopefully God will be pleased with us,

271
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
我們回教會,

272
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
因為我們是worshippers,

273
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We are worshippers of God,

274
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We don't come to church to please God,

275
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
and hopefully He will save us,

276
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
hopefully He will let us into heaven,

277
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No, we are adopted as His child,

278
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
我們是祂的孩子,

279
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
我們回來教會,

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
是去敬拜,

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
因為we are worshippers,

282
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
we are worshippers,

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
神adopted我們,

284
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
給我們有個freedom,

285
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
去serve 祂,

286
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We serve Him not because of obligation,

287
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
我們為甚麼去serve呢?

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We serve because we love Him,

289
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
這是很不同的difference,

290
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
big difference,

291
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Being versus doing,

292
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Being versus doing,

293
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
神愛我們,

294
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
我們可以愛身邊的人,

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Not because we need to get love from each one of them,

296
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We are not desperate for love,

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
from relationships,

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
from society,

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We are free to love,

300
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
because God's love is in and through,

301
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
love goes in and through us,

302
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
goes in and through us,

303
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
另一個林宣豪,

304
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Jeremy Lin,

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
他剛剛上年贏過NBA Championship,

306
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
in 2019,

307
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The first Asian to win an NBA Championship,

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
但你知不知道他打了多久的時間?

309
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
How long did he play for in the finals?

310
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He played for only maybe a minute or two minutes,

311
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
在game over那次,

312
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
差不多over那次,

313
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
他要有人sub,

314
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
他就come in,

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He only played for a minute or two,

316
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
他自己懷疑自己,

317
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Am I really a champion?

318
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
我只是打了一兩個分鐘,

319
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
在那個final那次,

320
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
做NBA的球員,

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
不容易的,

322
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
你的stat,

323
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
你射得好,

324
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
如果你的stat好,

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
你射得好,

326
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
你defend得好,

327
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You get to play,

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
但你一射得不好,

329
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
或者coach覺得你不是team的system,

330
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
他就可能put you on the bench,

331
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You can't play,

332
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
但林雪玉怎樣說,

333
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
他的identity不是一些stat,

334
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
不是射得多好,

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
多準,

336
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
His identity is found in God,

337
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
in God's love for him,

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
and he is a champion,

339
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
not because of what he's done,

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the minute that he played,

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
but because of what God has done,

342
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
in and through his life,

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He is a champion,

344
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
and we are champions,

345
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
we are adopted as his child,

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
not because of what we've done,

347
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
不是因為我們做了什麼special,

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
我們自己不是可以當我們自己,

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's because of what God has done,

350
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
through Jesus Christ,

351
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You are adopted.

352
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
我記得我們有一個學生,

353
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
他之前,

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
小時候,

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
他爸爸媽媽經常和他讀聖經,

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
讀什麼呢?

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
讀The Book of Judges,

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
or The Book of Deuteronomy,

359
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
經常說,

360
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
如果你不做這件事,

361
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
神會punish你,

362
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
神會punish你,

363
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
神會punish你,

364
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
他長大的時候,

365
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
就經常覺得神是一個punishing God,

366
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
他經常覺得他自己是錯的,

367
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He's not good enough,

368
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He's not good enough to be accepted,

369
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
as his son and daughter,

370
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
to be adopted,

371
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
to be loved,

372
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
他覺得他自己不是神愛,

373
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
我記得我和他hiking一次,

374
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
on the top of the mountain,

375
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
or the hill 那個時候,

376
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
他就和我說,

377
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Johnny, 我很嬲神,

378
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I told God to strike me down,

379
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
他覺得神很,

380
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
so against him,

381
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
我就說, 你冷靜點,

382
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
神愛你的,

383
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
我們開始讀新約的時候,

384
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
其實他沒有讀新約,

385
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
其實舊約,新約都說,

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
God loves us,

387
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
God is slow to anger,

388
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
quick to listen,

389
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and abundant in love,

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
in the Old Testament,

391
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
他慢慢看新約的時候,

392
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
他發現神猜不住耶穌,

393
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
因為祂為我們,

394
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
為我們死,

395
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
主耶穌為我們死,

396
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
釘十字架,

397
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
and He is a love child,

398
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and now,

399
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
He is willing to go out in love,

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
to reach other people,

401
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
other groups,

402
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
non-Christians,

403
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
and so today,

404
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I hope that you know,

405
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
you are adopted as a child of God,

406
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
there's nothing you can do,

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
that will change that,

408
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
that God loves you,

409
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
我們有三個application,

410
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
第一樣,

411
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
是你,

412
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
do you realize,

413
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
你是一個child of God,

414
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
神是領養你的,

415
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
我希望如果你未,

416
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
你是可以接受主耶穌是你的救主,

417
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and you have confessed Jesus to be the Lord and Savior in your life,

418
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
你會有一個new identity,

419
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
a new family,

420
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
and a new inheritance in Jesus Christ,

421
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
第二樣,

422
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
are you acting like a child of God,

423
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
a son and a daughter,

424
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
are you acting like a son or a daughter,

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
沒有的話,

426
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
we need to be imitators of God,

427
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
be more and more like Jesus Christ,

428
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
walk in the light,

429
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
walk in His love,

430
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
be filled with the spirit,

431
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
被聖的寵物,

432
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
我們是不是acting like children of God,

433
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
第三樣,

434
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
if we are acting like children of God,

435
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
are we sharing His love,

436
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
我們在這個society,

437
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
在這個時間,

438
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
這麼多的hopelessness,

439
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
are we being the light of Christ,

440
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
are we going out in the love of Christ,

441
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
to love others,

442
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
to give people hope in this dark time,

443
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
the greatest hope is the living hope,

444
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
and that is Jesus Christ,

445
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
there is no greater time now,

446
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
to share the love of God,

447
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
to share the hope of Christ,

448
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
and so I hope that today,

449
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
you know you are an adopted child of God,

450
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and that God wants to live in and through you,

451
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
to be the light in this city,

452
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
in this dark time,

453
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
God bless you.
