[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Welcome to Explorer. Today we are going to think about God's Word.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   This week is the third sermon of Becoming the Winner of Life Series.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   In the last two weeks, Pastor Irene has talked about how to define success.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Pastor Johnny has also talked about how to pay for success.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   We can learn a lot from Pastor Johnny's teaching.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   We often talk about success, becoming the winner.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   We often see success in the spiritual aspect,
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   which is the relationship between us and God.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Success in life, education, etc. may not be in conflict with us.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   But in a realistic situation, we need to make choices.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   For example, when we see a pandemic,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   we may have to cancel the church service.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   These are the times when we have to make choices in life.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   What do we need to pay attention to when making choices?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   We may have a lot of considerations.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Is there any resource in the Bible that can help us make decisions?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Let's look at the 30 chapters of the Bible.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Let's think about how to make choices.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   The Bible is very important to the Israelites.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   The Bible has a lot of principles of faith.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   It explains how the Israelites have fallen in history.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   The arrival of the Israelites in Galilee was a big moment.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   They ended their many years of exile and officially entered God's business.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   If we remember the books of Ezekiel and Nehemiah,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   there are many laws and rules written by God to the Israelites.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   These rules and rules may be unfamiliar to us in our society.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   If we break these rules, we will be punished.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   The Bible has more than 30 chapters.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   The Bible is located at the last part of the Bible.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It is the last part of the Bible.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   In the previous part, Moses has given a lot of instructions on how to follow the law.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Today, we are going to look at the last part of Moses' instruction on the Israelites.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   We said that we may follow the law in our society.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   If we break these rules, we will be punished.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   But does God look at us like this?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Are we really afraid of God's punishment because we make life decisions?
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   What I want to tell you today is that we make life decisions
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   not because we are afraid of making mistakes.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   We are not afraid of failure.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It is because we love God and we are willing to choose what God expects us to choose.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   We make life decisions.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   The first point I want to talk about is the foundation of choice.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   The foundation of choice is that we are willing to love God and our relationship with God.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   In the Bible, chapter 30, verses 15-16, it says,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   "And the Lord said to Hannah, 'Today I have written the new testament before you,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   and I have commanded you to love Jehovah your God, to follow his way,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   to follow his commandments, laws, and commandments,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   so that you may be able to live forever and have many people.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Jehovah your God, may all your works be fulfilled, and may your blessings be upon the earth as it is in heaven.'"
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   This is the conclusion of Moses to the Israelites.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   It is worth noting that the first sentence in the Bible is not a punishment to warn or warn the Israelites.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   In today's society, if we make a mistake, we have to bear the consequences.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   For example, if we litter, we have to pay a fine of $1,500.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Some laws are not very suspicious.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   For example, have you ever tried to drink water on the subway?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   It turns out that drinking water on the subway is not allowed.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Drinking water is against the regulations of Hong Kong Railways.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   It turns out that drinking water on the subway is against one of the regulations of Hong Kong Railways.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   This regulation says that after entering the train station,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   you cannot eat or try to eat any food, drink or try to drink any drink,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   whether it is alcoholic or non-alcoholic.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   It sounds like a long reading.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Of course, water is also included in this regulation.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So if someone has tried to drink water on the subway,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   it is against the regulations.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   If we do it, we will be found out and we have to pay a fine of $2,000.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   These are some of the regulations in society.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I mentioned some of the strange regulations in the last month's lecture.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   In a nutshell, when we look at some of the regulations in the Bible,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   the writing is a bit similar.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   For example, I will give you the simplest example.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   In the 22nd chapter of the Bible, chapter 6-7, it says,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   "If you meet a birdcage on the way, or on a tree, or on the ground,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   or on the water, or on a tree, or on a tree,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   or on a tree, or on a tree, or on a tree,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   you cannot take it with you,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   but you can take it with you,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   so that you can be happy and live a long life."
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   It turns out that many laws in the Bible are very detailed.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   As we just saw, whether it is garbage, or even the Hong Kong Railway Act,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   these are all very detailed parts.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Even the birds can go to Hong Kong.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   In the Bible, there are 613 laws in the 5 books,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   the Genesis, the Egyptian, the Leviticus, the Gospels, and the Gospels.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   You may say, "Wow, so many laws.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Isn't it easy to be misled and fall into the wrong path,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   and then be punished by God?"
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   But as I mentioned earlier,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   the core of the Bible is not just about being punished for breaking the law.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Today, the law of our society often scares us
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   by punishing us,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   by telling us not to do wrong things.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   But in life, we have to make a successful decision,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   not just because we are afraid of the consequences.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   For the Israelites, the most important reason for following the law is not to avoid punishment,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   but because they are willing to love Jehovah,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   and they are willing to choose the right way to express their love and loyalty to God.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   The key to success for the Israelites is not relying on their military,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   political, economic, or their own ability,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   but to follow the law of Jehovah.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And it is in the law that God finds their heart.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   So in the Bible, the Israelites choose to follow God,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   to follow the law,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   not to be punished, not to be fined, not to be imprisoned,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   not to be killed by God,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   but because they are willing to cherish the relationship with God.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   In fact, we read some of the scriptures in the 30th chapter of the Bible,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   chapter 9-10, God is very sure that
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   when the Israelites are willing to love God,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   God will make all the things in their hands,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   all the things they have created, all the things they have done,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   all the things they have done,
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   all the things they have done,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   all the things they have done,
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   God knows.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   God wants us to make choices,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   not only the relationship,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   but also to experience it in our lives.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   For example,
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   maybe you are listening to this sermon today,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   or you are a student who has just finished the DSC exam,
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   or you are preparing to study hard for the DSC,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   or you are going to study,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   actually, the most important thing for us is to study.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   In last month's "HK Road",
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I mentioned a Singaporean church
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   who have high requirements for their students' studies,
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   and they will use the awards to encourage them to study hard.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Are there any successful examples?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Here are some of the users' personal experiences.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Let's watch the video.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   One of the academic excellence services,
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I learned it's more important to ask the right question
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   than to find the right answers.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   I realized that I had to take ownership of my learning.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   So in class, I start asking my teacher questions.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I began to understand the content better.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   I also learned to communicate my thoughts more clearly.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   It also helped that I could depend on God.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Every time I studied,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I prayed to God for wisdom and understanding.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Whenever I was stressed,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   God gave me the peace to focus and stay motivated.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   As I changed my study habits and my mindset towards studying,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   my results improved greatly.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   For all the four semesters in IT,
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I scored a perfect GPA of 4 out of 4.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I graduated with two awards as a top student of my course.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Out of the entire IT core of 25,000 students,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   I was one out of 15 who were awarded the Lee Kuan Yew Scholarship.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   This award recognizes students with outstanding academic
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   and co-curricular achievements.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   This gave me a full scholarship to pursue a diploma in polytechnic.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   There, I continued to do well and graduated with a GPA of 3.65 out of 4.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   This result meant that I was eligible for all the top universities in Singapore.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   I was so happy to secure a place in Nanyang Technological University
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   to study engineering.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Through the Academy Excellence Program,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I was also inspired to look beyond myself and to think for others.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   During my first year in university,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I heard about the Interfaith Tuition Program
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   organized by Heart of God Church and Khaled Moss.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Tutors from both the church and the Moss provided free tuition
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   for the secondary school students taking their major exams.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   It was the perfect opportunity to help others.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   So, I volunteered myself to be a tutor.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   It touched my heart to be able to guide the students in their studies.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   In church, I mentored a group of 20 young people.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Some of them struggled in their confidence like how I used to.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   I felt so much for them.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I knew their lives could be changed too, just as how God changed mine.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Throughout my time in university,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   my grades improved with each semester.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   After three years, I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Never would I have imagined a boy like me to get a university degree.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   In fact, I was the first in my family to graduate from a university.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   My family was so proud.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Initially, I thought getting a job would be difficult.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I would have been happy to receive any job offer.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   But even before I graduated, miraculously I received paid job offers.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   After graduation, I chose to work as a management associate in a multinational company.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Looking back, the principles I've learned through the Academy Excellence Programme
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   have changed the way I approach my studies and in fact, my entire life.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   I've come so far from the lazy boy who was never interested in studying.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   From EM3 to IT to Polytechnic to university.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   And now, as a young working adult, God has been with me every step of the way.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   I'm so grateful to God for Heart of God Church and its Academy Excellence Programme.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   If we watch this video, we might feel that
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   the so-called success of life, not only in the name of the Holy Spirit,
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   can also affect what happens in our daily lives.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   As the Bible says, when we love God and are willing to make His will,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   this real success is not just a success in the name of the Holy Spirit,
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   but it can also be reflected in our daily lives.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   When we make our life decisions based on the motivation of loving God,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   what we get can go far beyond our expectations.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   This is different from the way we follow the law,
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   or the way we follow the law in society, or the way we follow the law in school.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   The motivation is different.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   In society, we are often afraid of being arrested by the police,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   or even afraid of being jailed.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   But God does not use this method to control the Israelis.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   When He explains these provisions,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   even though the Israelis are arrested, they still have to use other methods to pay the price.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   But God still hopes that the Israelis can live a truly blessed life.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   The core motivation of the Israeli Law of Protection is their willingness to love God.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   If we love God as the basis of our choices,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   what are the principles of our choices?
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Of course, there are a lot of different choices in life.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   For example, today, after you wake up or after you listen to this sermon,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   do you want to eat? Where do you want to go?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Of course, during this time of the epidemic, we may not go out often,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   but we may think about what we want to eat, and whether we want to meet our friends.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   These may be small decisions.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And maybe when someone in the middle of the day wants to choose what major to study in university,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   these decisions are very different.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   It may seem to affect your life decisions.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Of course, today, our sermon is mainly about some major decisions,
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   that is, decisions about the direction of life.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Everyone has a different situation,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   that is, there are many factors to consider.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   But today I just want to tell you about a big principle,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   which is to choose what is best for your life.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Or, in the words of the Bible, "choose your life".
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   In the 30th chapter of the Bible, verses 19-20, it says,
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   "Today I am calling upon the heavens and the earth to witness to you,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   that I will bring forth the new life and the blessed life before you.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   So you must choose your life,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   so that you and your descendants may live forever.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And I will call upon your God, and if you listen to him,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   you will be in his care, for he is your life,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   and your days will be long, depending on him."
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   As we mentioned, the basis for our choice is to love our God,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   and to be willing to glorify Him.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Often we will get more than we think.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   But we also understand that in reality,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   when we follow the command of God to make a choice,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   there is a chance of loss.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   For example, two years ago, I was serving a group of college students at the Sun Yat-sen factory.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   One of the students, a sophomore,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   was studying engineering at the university.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   He mentioned that he wanted to go to the university to do a postgraduate study.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   I think he was a good student,
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   so he might not have been suspected of having a cat.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   In fact, in the Sun Yat-sen factory,
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   students are used to having a cat when they are studying.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Of course, as we all know,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   the exam is normally submitted by the teacher during the exam,
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   and the student is not allowed to have a cat.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   But this sophomore, who was studying engineering in the second year,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   encountered a problem.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   The teacher would tell the student the exam questions in advance.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   After the exam, the student could cheat.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   In other words, the teacher would not care if the student took out a book and copied the answer.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Why did he do that?
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Because in this university,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   the teacher's ranking and grades
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   depend on the students' grades in the exam.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   So the teacher could let the student cheat,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   or even tell the student the question,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   which could improve the student's performance
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   or the evaluation.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   The cat student was not a problem.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Because the teacher could get a good grade,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   and the student could get a good grade.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   So the student could get a good grade.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Of course, everyone understands that
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   this is unacceptable for the Christian.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   So for this sophomore,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   he faced a big challenge.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   He could get 100 points if he had a cat with the student.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   He would not be very optimistic.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   If he didn't have a cat,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   and he just studied,
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   his grades would be low.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   The students would laugh at him,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   or ask him why he was so stupid.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   How did he make this decision?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I don't know if you think it's just a test.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Just a test.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Just let it go.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   At most, he could pray to God to forgive him.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   But I think in the Bible,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   we make decisions in our life.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Not all decisions are perfect.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   We just learned that
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   there are many successful testimonies
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   in the Singapore church
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   that God is unyielding.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   But sometimes, in the real world,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   God is likely to have a big loss,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   or be laughed at.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   If we look at the part of the Bible
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   where Moses is mentioned,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   in the 19th to 20th verses,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   he tells the Israelites that
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   God has given him a new life,
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   and he will die for them.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Moses did not say that
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   you have to choose a life
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   that is pure and pure.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   He said that you have to choose your life,
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   so that you and your descendants
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   can be saved.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   The choice of life is not just about
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   the good of the material world,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   or the success of your life.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   It is also about whether the Israelites
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   can use God's blessings
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   to choose a meaningful life.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   At that time, many foreigners in Ghana
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   were happy when they worshiped God,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   or when they let their desires go.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   But they were still restricted by many restrictions,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   whether it was material,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   or religious indulgence,
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   or moral corruption,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   or social chaos.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   God hopes that the Israelites choose their lives
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   so that they will not fall into the trap of others,
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   but so that our lives have true freedom,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   and meaningful lives.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   The brother mentioned earlier,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   how did he decide?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   He did not show his cat.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   He did not look at the questions.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   The teacher would send an email
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   to say that he would give the questions.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   But he did not look at the questions.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   You may think that
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   he got full marks.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   History is not always perfect.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   The whole class got 90+ marks.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   The brother only got 60+ marks.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   But when he shared this testimony
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   with other brothers in the group,
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   he said directly,
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   "I am suffering for Christ."
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   "When my classmates asked me why I was so stupid,
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   I told them I was a Christian,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   and I did not want to show my cat."
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   The brother was in a society
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   that was based on atheism,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   and even against the Church.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Many people wanted to be in the church,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   but they were not as good as the church.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   They wanted to make quick money.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   They did not care about morality.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   The brother had a small choice.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Of course, his grades were important to him.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   He could have followed others,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   but he chose to stick to his values.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   He chose to live a life
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   that God wanted him to live.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   He did not care about the price.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   I do not know what you are going to face today.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Maybe some of you will have to
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   choose your major.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   But I want to tell you
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   that God is watching over us.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   It is not about what we choose.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   It is not about whether we are successful or not.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   God wants us to love Him.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   He wants us to choose the most meaningful decision.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   Our mentors, pastors,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   and friends can give us advice
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   and help us choose the best decision.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   But the final decision is yours.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   When we talk about the winner of life,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   we hope to be successful in life.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   But the relationship between us and God is more important.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   The true winner is defined by God's expectation
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   and love for us.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   What do you think of God's love for you?
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Do you think that following the law
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   or following the Bible is a difficult thing?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   But what do you think is the most important thing in your life?
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   How do you want to get it?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   The most basic question is
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   that we are Christians and we believe in Jesus.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Does believing in Jesus bring us a change
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   in our life and our decisions?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   But we can also make a meaningful decision
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   in our life.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Let's pray together.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   God of mercy,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   thank you for letting us understand and learn the law.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   You remind us that success is the relationship between us
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   and the life we live.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Lord Jesus,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   thank you for blessing us today.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   We are in a pandemic,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   but you are healthy.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   We are healthy and wise.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   We pray for our students who are waiting for the exam.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   We pray for them to have a peaceful life.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Lord, bless us to experience more in our life.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   Thank you for listening to our prayer.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Amen.
