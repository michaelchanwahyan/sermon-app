1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
 Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,720
 Hope you're all doing well.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,200
 We're starting, we've been starting this new series last week.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,040
 It's on 1 Peter chapter 2.

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,060
 And it's going to be a little bit of an interactive sermon today.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,240
 So get ready to type.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,200
 The first thing I want you to type in the chat is what comes up?

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,680
 What's the first thing that comes up on your mind when it says God's grace and submission?

9
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:36,260
 What's the first thing that comes to mind when it says God's grace and submission?

10
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,200
 You can type anything you want.

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
 Jesus.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,720
 Yeah, very good.

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,720
 Very good.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,720
 The cross.

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,720
 Absolutely.

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,000
 Grace and submission.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Obedience.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Very good.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 From Anshan.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Yeah.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,200
 Anything else?

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,760
 What comes to mind?

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,400
 Letting go of ourselves.

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,440
 That's a very good one, right?

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,120
 Letting go to receive God's grace and also giving ourselves to God.

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,120
 Absolutely.

27
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
 Salvation.

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
 Very good.

29
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,160
 Any other, any other, any other things that come to mind when we think of God's grace

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
 and submission?

31
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
 Okay.

32
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,440
 Those are very good.

33
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,800
 So last week, Pastor James did an excellent talk on teaching us what it means to have

34
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,280
 living hope.

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,060
 And last week we saw, right, we have inheritance because we are now part of God's family.

36
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,000
 And because of this inheritance, we also have reward.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,400
 In verse six to seven, Pastor James talked about the suffering that we also have.

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,800
 And when we have this suffering, God refines us so that we become more like him and we

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,360
 receive salvation through Jesus.

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,280
 And he is the one that rescues us.

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,880
 And so today we are talking about the next part, which is grace and submission, grace

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,360
 and submission.

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,260
 So there's four things that we're going to talk about today in terms of grace and submission.

44
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,240
 The first is that we are part of the same family.

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
 That's right.

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,280
 Look at the people beside you.

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,880
 We're part of the same family.

48
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,200
 Like it or not, we're part of the same family.

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,800
 The second thing we're going to learn about is we are stones in the same house.

50
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,080
 We are priests in the same temple, number three.

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,200
 And number four, we are citizens of the same nation.

52
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,160
 So we're going to read the passage for today.

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,840
 So verse 22 here, "Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere

54
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,600
 brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart.

55
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,760
 Because you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable through the living

56
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,960
 and abiding word of God.

57
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:59,240
 So put away all malice and deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slender like newborn infants,

58
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:06,560
 long for the pure spiritual milk that by it you may grow up into salvation.

59
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,400
 If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good."

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:20,360
 And so we see here in the second part of chapter one that Peter is confirming that we have

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,640
 been born again, right?

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,840
 We have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable.

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,580
 What Jesus has done on the cross for us is that now we no longer live for the earthly

64
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:44,000
 and the temporary, but now we live for the eternal and for the heavenly things.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,440
 And so we have been born again, as we see in the next slide, that we are part of the

66
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,440
 same family.

67
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,600
 We've been born again to the same family.

68
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:00,840
 And Jesus also does that to us, for us through the living and abiding word of God.

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,920
 His word is truth.

70
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,320
 What he says, he will accomplish.

71
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:11,240
 And his promise was that if we believe in our heart that Jesus Christ is Lord, we are

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,280
 now part of his family.

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,180
 We are a child of God.

74
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,240
 And so this is what God has done for us.

75
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,960
 He's died on the cross for us so that we are born again.

76
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:30,140
 We are now born for the eternal, for the heavenly, and we are born through the word of God.

77
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:37,540
 It says here, through the living and abiding word of God, that Jesus is the word, the way,

78
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,540
 the life, and the truth.

79
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,500
 And no one comes to the Father except through him.

80
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,840
 And so that's what God has done.

81
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,980
 And so this is God's part.

82
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,580
 That part is grace.

83
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,220
 What we need to do is we need to submit.

84
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,780
 And Peter tells us here that we need to purify ourselves, right?

85
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,620
 Because we've been born again, we need to pure ourselves.

86
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,740
 No more slander, no more malice.

87
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,500
 Do good things to each other.

88
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,020
 We need to love each other earnestly.

89
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,460
 We need to put away sin.

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:16,100
 And a great example of this is the prodigal son, right?

91
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,020
 When he recognized, I've done wrong things.

92
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,540
 I can go back to my father if I turn from my ways of wild living, of throwing away all

93
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,060
 my inheritance.

94
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,420
 He had to put away his sins first.

95
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:38,700
 As we see in the next slide, the prodigal son returns to the father.

96
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,460
 He's willing to obey.

97
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,620
 And what does the father do?

98
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,380
 The father runs to him with open arms.

99
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:53,540
 He sees his son in the distant and he runs to him and he receives the father and receives

100
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,660
 his son, the prodigal son.

101
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,500
 And so that is what we need to do as we are part of the same family.

102
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:09,300
 Yes, we've received God's grace already, but we also need to do our part to obey, to love

103
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:13,940
 one another, to put away sin.

104
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,100
 And the last part that Peter also said is that we need to long for pure spiritual milk

105
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,660
 so that we will be able to grow.

106
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:28,060
 Now a lot of us in this KFC family has had newborn babies.

107
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,060
 Praise the Lord, right?

108
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,580
 We have Josh and Mel.

109
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,260
 We have Sam and Rachel.

110
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,740
 We have Rocky and Adrian.

111
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:43,220
 We have lots of people that we've been blessed as this KFCI family with newborn babies.

112
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,460
 We've had people with new newborn dogs, right?

113
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:54,060
 And puppies, Vincent and Agnes, you know, dogs are a special part of our family as well.

114
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,620
 What's amazing about these babies, these puppies, is that they don't have to think twice about

115
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,100
 spiritual, about milk, right?

116
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,300
 They long for milk.

117
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,940
 They know they need it, right?

118
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
 The babies aren't like, "Oh yeah, I don't know.

119
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,660
 I don't know if I want milk today.

120
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,340
 You know, I might not feel like milk today."

121
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,300
 No, they long for milk.

122
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,320
 You know, Agnes' puppy, it longs for food, right?

123
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,380
 It doesn't have to think twice about it.

124
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,900
 And so if we are doing the right things, we will naturally long for spiritual milk.

125
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,940
 We will long to grow in the Word of God through prayer, through fellowship, through our church

126
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,300
 community.

127
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,480
 And so that is what we need to do as we submit to the Lord.

128
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,180
 And so the first thing that we see in grace and submission is that we are part of the

129
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,340
 same family.

130
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,180
 The second part of it is that we are stones in the same house.

131
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,700
 I want you to type in the chat, what is the biggest thing that you've built?

132
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,620
 It could be a model car.

133
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,660
 It could be a snowman.

134
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,500
 It could be a sandcastle.

135
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,780
 What's the biggest thing that you've built?

136
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,200
 It could be a, I know Joseph has built a lot of things, right?

137
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,540
 What's the biggest thing that you've built?

138
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,180
 Come on, don't take too long.

139
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,720
 What's the biggest thing you've built?

140
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,000
 It could be something small.

141
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,620
 It could be something big.

142
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,780
 What's the biggest thing that you've built?

143
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
 A wall.

144
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,780
 Okay.

145
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,780
 All right.

146
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,500
 Hopefully, hopefully we're building bridges, not walls.

147
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,340
 Ikea furniture.

148
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
 That's right.

149
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,340
 A family.

150
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
 Oh, very good.

151
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,620
 We're getting very, very spiritual here.

152
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,900
 A Lego boat.

153
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,900
 That's super cool.

154
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,300
 I wonder what boat it was.

155
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
 All right.

156
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,300
 What else?

157
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
 What else do we have?

158
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
 A new family.

159
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,300
 Awesome.

160
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,300
 That's great.

161
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,860
 A fort in the woods.

162
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,860
 Oh my.

163
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,840
 I wonder what kind of material you built that fort with.

164
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,500
 Anybody built a snowman or a snow fort or an igloo?

165
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,420
 That's something we like to do in Canada when we have snow.

166
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,420
 All right.

167
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:15,220
 We're going to read the next passage about how God is building us in the same house.

168
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,420
 Verse four, "As you come to him, a living stone rejected by man, but in the sight of

169
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,940
 God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual

170
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:36,140
 house to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus

171
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,340
 Christ.

172
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:45,580
 For it stands in scripture, 'Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen

173
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:51,660
 and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.'"

174
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,540
 And so we see here that God has built.

175
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:05,460
 God has built stones that were once rejected, but now chosen and precious.

176
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:12,940
 Jesus was rejected, but he was chosen by the Father, chosen by the Father, and he himself

177
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,940
 is precious.

178
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,740
 And we are also like those living stones.

179
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,980
 Peter says that we might also be rejected by people or the world, but we were chosen

180
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,300
 and we are also precious according to the Father.

181
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:34,060
 And he builds us up into a spiritual house, into a spiritual house.

182
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,240
 It's amazing that the Jews, they have the temple, right?

183
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,900
 If you've been to Jerusalem, if you've been to Israel with Pastor John, you would have

184
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,300
 been to this amazing temple, right?

185
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,940
 They think that this wall is part of the temple.

186
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,040
 The Jews have a temple.

187
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,500
 And Jesus says, "We also have a temple."

188
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,340
 And the temple is that we are the body of Christ.

189
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,820
 Our bodies is the temple of God.

190
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,980
 If you've been to Dubai or if you've been to a really tall building and you look up,

191
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:18,660
 right, as we see, you know, the purge caliph, right, in the next slide, we look up and we're

192
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,940
 just amazed how amazing this building is.

193
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:33,720
 Imagine that each glass, each metal part, each brick, each component of the purge caliph

194
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,940
 is like us.

195
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:43,380
 We are being built up into a spiritual house, a living spiritual house.

196
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,500
 Has anybody played Jenga before?

197
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,940
 Everybody loves playing Jenga, right?

198
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,820
 It's an amazing game, right?

199
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,740
 You're taking brick from brick, what you call it, those wooden logs or wooden bricks, right?

200
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,200
 And you're taking it up from the bottom and you're trying to put it onto the top.

201
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,740
 And this Jenga spiritual house is getting bigger and bigger as new people come to know

202
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,820
 Jesus.

203
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,980
 And we have to be very careful because it might tumble, right?

204
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,420
 That's not going to happen in our spiritual house because Jesus is building us up.

205
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:25,540
 Don't worry, this spiritual house will not collapse because Jesus is the foundation.

206
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,620
 His word is the foundation.

207
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:35,180
 And so the second thing that we see is God's grace is that we are part of this spiritual

208
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,900
 house that is being built up.

209
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,140
 And we also partake upon it.

210
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:49,100
 We need to submit to the body of Christ as we are part of his spiritual house.

211
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:55,620
 And so the next thing we see is that we are priests in the same temple.

212
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,200
 So firstly, we are of the same family.

213
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,220
 The second thing is we are stones of the same house.

214
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,840
 And thirdly, we are priests in the same temple.

215
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,100
 And so let's read the next passage together.

216
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:13,160
 And you yourselves, like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house to be

217
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:20,180
 a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God.

218
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,940
 But you are a chosen race, in verse 9, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his

219
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:34,180
 own possession that you may proclaim his excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into

220
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,480
 his marvelous light.

221
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,240
 So what is a priest?

222
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,880
 You guys can type into the chat, what is a priest?

223
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,720
 What is a royal priesthood?

224
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,700
 Any ideas?

225
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,600
 What is the role or the occupation or the job of a priest?

226
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,640
 What is a priest?

227
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
 Any ideas?

228
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,520
 Type in the chat for me.

229
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,000
 What is the role or a job of a priest?

230
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,240
 Okay, Julian, very good.

231
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,360
 He mediates between us and God, one who is set apart, very good, serving God.

232
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,080
 Yeah, these are excellent.

233
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:22,000
 That is exactly what a priest should do, perform sacrifices as offerings to preach.

234
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,200
 Absolutely.

235
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,240
 These are all what a priest should do.

236
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:34,480
 And so God's grace is that we have been called to be a holy and royal priesthood.

237
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,280
 Before it was just the line of the Levites, right?

238
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:44,320
 They, a specific tribe within Israel, they were called to be priests, to be mediators

239
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,800
 between them and the rest of the other tribes.

240
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,580
 Before, they were called to make sacrifices on behalf of the people.

241
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:00,520
 But now we are called to be a holy and royal priesthood.

242
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,360
 And what Jesus calls us to do, and what Peter specifically calls us to do now is that we

243
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:14,360
 must offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

244
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
 Let's add to that.

245
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,880
 What do you think are spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ that

246
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,760
 now we as Christians offer?

247
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:33,320
 Obviously, you know, we're not bringing our goats and our lambs to our online Zoom services

248
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:40,680
 and offering them as blood sacrifices and sin offerings to the Lord because now we have

249
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,400
 Jesus Christ.

250
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:49,280
 And so what are spiritual sacrifices that we need to offer?

251
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
 That's very good.

252
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,760
 Confession, absolutely.

253
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,320
 Confession, obedience.

254
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
 Very good.

255
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,560
 Wow, you guys should be preaching this.

256
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
 You know, not me.

257
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
 You guys are excellent.

258
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,720
 Yeah, come on.

259
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
 Keep adding to that.

260
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,080
 What else?

261
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,460
 What else are spiritual sacrifices that we can offer to the Lord that can be acceptable

262
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,460
 to Him?

263
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,440
 What do you guys think?

264
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,880
 Any others?

265
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,320
 Our own way of doing things.

266
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,320
 That's interesting.

267
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,200
 What do you mean by that, Michelle?

268
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,880
 What do you mean by that?

269
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,880
 Any others?

270
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
 Obedience.

271
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
 Okay.

272
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,240
 How we live our lives.

273
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,440
 Yes, absolutely.

274
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,000
 Jesus says, or Paul says in Romans 8 that we are living sacrifices.

275
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 Right?

276
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Worship.

277
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Absolutely.

278
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 Very good.

279
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,520
 Oh, Anthony, you've been learning a lot in your seminary classes.

280
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,960
 Let's look at the next slide and it'll give us some ways that we can offer sacrifices

281
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
 to the Lord.

282
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,960
 Prayer.

283
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
 As we pray.

284
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
 Right?

285
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,400
 Prayer is a pleasing aroma to the Lord.

286
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,280
 Prayer is our way of saying that we submit to you, Lord.

287
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,840
 That we ask your will to be done.

288
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,520
 As we praise the Lord, just like Paul and the team led us in praise.

289
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,040
 That is offering spiritual sacrifices to the Lord.

290
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,440
 Michelle, you know, she said, obedience.

291
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,240
 And that we need to offer ourselves as living sacrifices.

292
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,920
 We can offer ourselves through time as we serve the Lord.

293
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
 Right?

294
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,480
 As we spend time helping those around us.

295
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,480
 Loving our neighbors.

296
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,160
 Honoring our parents.

297
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
 We can tithe.

298
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
 Right?

299
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,580
 We can offer our offerings of tithe.

300
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,960
 Pastor John said we can offer, you know, through FPS.

301
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
 Right?

302
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,800
 That is one of the ways that we can offer spiritual sacrifices to the Lord.

303
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,420
 Our talents, obviously.

304
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,780
 Each of you have been blessed with many talents.

305
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,460
 It could be musical.

306
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,860
 It could be, you know, service.

307
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
 Right?

308
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,980
 It could be encouragement.

309
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,020
 It could be our heart.

310
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,020
 Absolutely.

311
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,580
 We can offer our hearts to the Lord as well.

312
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,900
 And we can also offer our testimony as spiritual sacrifice to the Lord.

313
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,180
 Pleasing to him.

314
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:10,660
 As we share with others what God has done in and through our lives.

315
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,620
 Just like Ken shared today.

316
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,440
 What God has done in and through his life.

317
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,060
 He was once lonely.

318
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:24,540
 And now he has found a relationship with God and a community with his church.

319
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,100
 Our church.

320
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:33,740
 And so, number three was that we are a spiritual priest.

321
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,420
 Holy and royal of the same temple.

322
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,140
 And finally, we are citizens of the same nation.

323
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,920
 Citizens of the same nation.

324
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,700
 It's amazing, right?

325
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,620
 That we can be part of the same nation.

326
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,500
 We have, we might all have different passports.

327
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
 Right?

328
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,380
 We might have British passports.

329
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,140
 We might have Hong Kong passports.

330
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,900
 I have a Canadian passport.

331
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
 Right?

332
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,380
 Some of you have other passports.

333
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,500
 Might be Australian.

334
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,100
 But we are all part of God's family.

335
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,500
 God's nation.

336
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,140
 We have a spiritual passport.

337
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,380
 And we're going to look at the last passage for us today.

338
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,180
 That you are a chosen people.

339
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,340
 A royal priesthood.

340
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,900
 A holy nation.

341
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,500
 God's special possession.

342
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:32,180
 That you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful

343
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,460
 light.

344
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,000
 Once you were not a people, but now you are a people of God.

345
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,380
 Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.

346
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,540
 And so we see here God's grace in the next slide.

347
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,540
 God's grace is that he has chosen us.

348
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
 He has chosen you.

349
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,660
 Me.

350
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,620
 All the people that you see on Zoom.

351
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,300
 And the people that you don't see on Zoom.

352
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,660
 Who only turn on, you know, who don't turn on their videos.

353
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:08,940
 Those people are also part of God's chosen nation.

354
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,380
 You're a royal priesthood.

355
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,740
 We are a holy nation.

356
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,860
 God has set us apart for his royal and holy purposes.

357
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,700
 Peter says that we are God's special possession.

358
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,900
 Once we were not a part of God's people, we were strangers.

359
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,620
 We were foreigners.

360
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,780
 But now God has accepted us.

361
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,820
 How amazing is that feeling when somebody new accepts us into his family.

362
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,340
 When we have a meal together.

363
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:51,060
 I remember when I first flew to New Zealand, I met some people on the plane to New Zealand.

364
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,220
 New Zealanders, Kiwis are the friendliest people.

365
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,020
 These people invited me over to their house to have a meal.

366
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,980
 We've just met on the plane.

367
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,460
 And they're like, come over.

368
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,700
 And you feel like you're a part of a family.

369
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,380
 You're a part of God's people.

370
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:15,860
 Jesus says we were once not a part of his people, but we've been received as his people.

371
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,860
 We have mercy now.

372
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,140
 And so that is God's grace.

373
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,420
 And what must we do now that we are part of his family?

374
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:34,980
 It says here we need to declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into

375
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,220
 his wonderful light.

376
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,460
 That is what we need to do as God's chosen people.

377
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,740
 Royal priesthood, a holy nation.

378
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,900
 And so we've been sharing tips towards sharing the good news.

379
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:58,300
 And we said that we need to have spiritual eyes to see the people around us who don't

380
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,380
 have Jesus.

381
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,140
 We need to connect with them, right?

382
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:09,100
 Through tennis, through music, maybe through financial talk, right?

383
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,700
 Maybe through walking our dogs together.

384
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,860
 We can connect with people that way.

385
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:19,380
 And as we connect with people through different things, we build trust.

386
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:26,580
 And people come to know Jesus because firstly, a lot of them know a Christian.

387
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:33,540
 And a Christian invites them to know Jesus through church, through different events.

388
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:39,880
 You know, what's amazing about Ken as we see Ken on the next slide is that he didn't believe

389
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,980
 in Jesus yet when he came to our summer college program.

390
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,060
 And he invited his friend, which was Justin.

391
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,900
 And Justin, he saw that, oh, Justin had been dealing with certain issues.

392
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,160
 He was dealing with certain relationship issues.

393
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,980
 And he wanted to invite him to church.

394
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,440
 And Ken was not a Christian yet.

395
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,940
 And Ken was like, come to church.

396
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,260
 You know, I think God can help you.

397
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,900
 It's because he came to our community.

398
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:13,560
 I mean, he saw what God's community can do, what God's people can do, what God's holy

399
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,360
 priesthood could do.

400
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:24,900
 Ken as a non-Christian invited Justin, a non-Christian, to come to SEP because he felt the community,

401
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,120
 the love of God.

402
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,200
 And that's what we've been called to do.

403
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:40,500
 We've been called to help people come out of darkness to see his light, to see his light.

404
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:46,220
 And so not only has Ken come to know Jesus, eventually me and Justin, he had a lot of

405
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
 questions.

406
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,640
 He was very curious about God.

407
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:57,040
 And after he went back to the UK, he also came into a loving relationship with Jesus.

408
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:03,340
 He came out of the spiritual darkness into the spiritual light.

409
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:12,560
 And so let me summarize what grace we have received from Jesus, that we have received

410
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,160
 a new identity.

411
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:24,580
 It's no longer lies and tangs and snell groves and chungs and engs and wongs.

412
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,580
 We are Christians.

413
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:34,060
 It's no longer lows and roths and fungs.

414
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,060
 We are Christians.

415
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,760
 We are part of the same family.

416
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,160
 We have a new identity.

417
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:45,420
 And that is found in Jesus Christ.

418
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:52,120
 Do you still see yourself as separated from God's family?

419
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,720
 Or do you have a new identity?

420
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,740
 And that is in Jesus Christ.

421
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:05,540
 What we need to do is come into obedience, submit to him, and be a part of this spiritual

422
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,880
 family.

423
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,020
 God's grace is that we have a new direction.

424
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,140
 We have a new spiritual direction.

425
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,640
 Jesus is our cornerstone.

426
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,280
 Cornerstone is the first stone you lay.

427
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:28,100
 And then after that, every stone goes according to that first cornerstone.

428
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,380
 Jesus is our new direction.

429
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,640
 Jesus has built up the body of Christ.

430
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,600
 We are the body of Christ.

431
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,180
 We have a new direction.

432
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,460
 We are not living for the earthly and the temporary.

433
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,800
 We are living for the eternal and the heavenly.

434
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,620
 We have a new direction.

435
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,060
 We have a new service.

436
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:57,940
 We are called to be priests, to mediate between us and God.

437
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,160
 Those who do not know God to God.

438
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,380
 We have a new service.

439
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,620
 We need to pray for those who do not know Jesus.

440
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,580
 We need to confess our own sins.

441
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:16,540
 We need to offer up our talents and our services to the Lord as holy and pleasing sacrifices

442
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,640
 to him.

443
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,300
 We have a new service.

444
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,340
 Are you willing to serve the Lord?

445
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,140
 No longer serve yourself, but serve the Lord.

446
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,940
 And lastly, we are a new people.

447
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,620
 We have a new covenant.

448
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,100
 Before it was God's chosen people.

449
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:42,780
 The Israelites, they had this calling to be a holy people.

450
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,180
 Chosen to serve God.

451
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,700
 And now this covenant is no longer just with the Israelites.

452
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,220
 It is with us.

453
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,980
 You, me, all of you on Zoom here.

454
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,780
 We are all part of God's holy nation.

455
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:03,140
 We have a new covenant.

456
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:14,060
 And this covenant is a calling to not just receive blessings from God, but to be a blessing.

457
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:21,220
 And so are you willing to be a blessing to those around you?

458
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,800
 Maybe it's your family.

459
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,220
 Be a blessing to them.

460
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,300
 Build them up.

461
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,340
 Help them to come one step closer towards Jesus.

462
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,860
 Maybe it's people at your workplace.

463
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,700
 It's often tricky, right?

464
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,500
 How do we share Jesus with those in the workplace?

465
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:46,980
 Connect with them, build trust, and set an example for them of the love and grace you've

466
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,980
 experienced from God.

467
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,220
 And so, do we have a new identity?

468
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,740
 Do we have a new direction?

469
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,540
 Do we have a new service?

470
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,220
 Do we have a new covenant with Christ?

471
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,300
 We're going to sing a song.

472
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
 It's called Cornerstone.

473
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,940
 Jesus is our cornerstone.

474
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:18,740
 He is the one that upholds our faith and builds us up.

475
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,740
 Let's pray.

476
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:26,240
 Heavenly Father, bless us so that we can be a blessing to others.

477
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,580
 Thank you for your grace, Father.

478
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:34,260
 We ask that you would help us to submit to you so that we can build others up.

479
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,780
 Call those who are in darkness into your wonderful light.
