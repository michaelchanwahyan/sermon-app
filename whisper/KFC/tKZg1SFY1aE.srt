1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 >> Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 It's good to see you all.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 What a powerful story.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 What a powerful story as we watch how Jesus was filled with compassion for the people that he met.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 It's an honor to be able to share just on this passage a little bit with you guys today.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 So anyway, great to see you all.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 The title is "Believing and Seeing."

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 I am going to screen share and actually control the slides from here.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 So let's see if this works.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Brilliant.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 So the title of today's sermon is "Believing is Seeing."

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 And, of course, focusing on that passage, and I'm going to be landing there.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 But I wanted to encourage you, if you do have a paper Bible, I would encourage you to put it in front of you,

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 because we are going to fly around a little bit.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Because actually when this sermon topic and title was given to me, the passage was actually longer.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 And I wondered why was it so long.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It actually went from Mark 6 to Mark 9.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 So I decided to focus on Mark 9.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 But then realizing afterwards that actually the context behind all of this, what happens beforehand,

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 actually really helps emphasize what happens here in Mark 9, and it's almost a climax.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 So I'm going to fly through a little bit.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I did a bit of a word play on, again, it's not creative.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Other people have done it as well.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 There's a saying which is "Seeing is believing."

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I'm sure there may have been people that you know who said they will believe in Christianity,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 they will believe in Jesus if they see him.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 I have to see it to believe it.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Have you heard of that?

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 I have to see it to believe it.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 But you see, the truth is that isn't how things work.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 You don't see something and then believe it.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 We don't necessarily see the virus, at least with our naked eye, but we know that it's existing

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 and it's seemingly alive and well.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 We don't actually truly get to see how a vaccine works, whether it works or not, actually.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And there's so much fake news going around.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 So even if you do see something with your own eyes, how convinced are you that it is real?

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 So really it isn't you have to see it to believe it, but rather at least if we look in Scripture,

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 what we see is actually if we are to have faith in something, we have to believe first before we see it.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 St. Augustine was the one who said, "Faith is to believe what you do not see.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 The reward of this faith is to see what you believe."

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Let me just say that again.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 "Faith is to believe what you do not see.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 The reward of this faith is to see what you believe."

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Martin Luther King would say, "Faith is taking the first step, even when you don't see the whole staircase."

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So taking that first step, that's why it's called a leap of faith.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 You have to take that step first before you see it.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 And one of my favorite quotes of all time by C.S. Lewis says this,

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 "I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen, not only because I see it,

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 but because by it I see everything else."

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 And Christianity, our faith, gives us the lens to see.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And so therefore, believing is seeing.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Now we here are believers.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Most of us here are believers.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And actually, we've believed in Jesus without ever seeing him.

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Actually, Jesus talks about that to John in John chapter 20, where he says,

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 "Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 So actually, right here, right now, brothers and sisters, we are blessed.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 We are blessed because we profess to have faith and believe in Jesus.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 And we haven't even seen him yet.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Have you also wondered, actually, just seeing Jesus isn't enough to actually believe him?

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Imagine all the people that saw him when he was on the earth.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Not all of them believed him.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 In fact, plenty wanted to kill him.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 So it's not as simple as that, is it?

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 If there are people who come to us and say, "Hey, I won't believe in Jesus until I need to see it for my own eyes."

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 No, actually, there's plenty of people who have actually seen Jesus in real life,

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 seen him do miracles, yet still don't believe.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So the equation isn't that simple.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 In fact, Jesus himself has his parable, and it's a strange parable.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 We won't have time to go into it today, but in Luke chapter 16, and he finishes and he says this.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 He says, "If they don't even listen to Moses and the prophets,

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead."

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 He's saying it's not as simple as, hey, just seeing someone rise from the dead and they'll believe.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 In fact, if they're not going to do it then, they're not going to do it now.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 What he's saying is that faith is a matter of the heart.

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 It doesn't matter how many miracles you see.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 It doesn't matter how many things you say you want to see, but faith ultimately comes down to a matter of the heart.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 And we see here in Mark chapter 9, at the very end, the Father declares those words that have always been with me.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 "I believe, help my unbelief. I believe, help my unbelief."

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And I want to talk about that, but before that, I want to really go into just some of the background, some of the context.

81
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 You see, up until now, these last few chapters, Jesus has been on a tear.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 He has been just going on miracle after miracle.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Luke chapter 6, he sends out the 12 disciples, and then he hears about the death of John the Baptist.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 And then 6 verse 30 in the book of Mark, Jesus feeds the 5,000, one of the most famous miracles that he does.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 People turn up, they're hungry, there's no bread, but boom, Jesus feeds them all.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Immediately after that, in verse 45, he walks on water.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 So first he feeds the 5,000, then he walks on water, he's going on a tear, and then he heals the sick.

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 And then he starts talking to the Pharisees, and then he heals more people.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 And then in chapter 8, he does something very funny.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 After feeding 5,000, he then feeds 4,000.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 But it's really interesting here. The disciples, I want to highlight something here.

92
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 The disciples saw him feed the 5,000. A couple of chapters later, they're in the same situation.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And now in chapter 8, verse 4, there's 4,000 people that need to be fed now.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And even though they just had witnessed him feeding 5,000, they still ask the same question.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 How can one feed these people with bread here in this desert place?

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 They just saw him multiply enough bread to feed 5,000 people.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 And now here is a similar situation, but they're still asking the same question.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 So they saw it, but they didn't believe it.

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 So again, it's a matter of the heart. It's a matter of did they really understand what was happening?

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Did they really understand who Jesus was?

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 And then in chapter 8, verse 11, the Pharisees come along.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 They hear about all these things and the Pharisees come along and they demand a sign.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They demand a sign from heaven.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 A sign from heaven to prove that he really is God, that he really does have authority that comes from God.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And then he says this really damning reply.

106
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Why does this generation seek a sign?

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 No sign will be given to this generation.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 Again, these Pharisees, they're coming. They will have heard about all the miracles.

110
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 They may have even seen some themselves.

111
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 Yeah, here they're wanting Jesus to do something mad.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 They're wanting him to open up the heavens, which already happened, actually, when the dove came down and descended on him.

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 But they wanted something like that. But Jesus is saying, no, you don't get it.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Even if I did something like that, you still wouldn't believe because your heart is not right.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Your heart is still hard.

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 And so the disciples, going back to them, they see Jesus feed 5000.

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 They see him walk on water. They see him, see him healed person after person.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 Then they see him feed the 4000.

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And then they get on a boat. And this is the fascinating thing.

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Eight verse 14. They forget to bring bread.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 After all those miracles about bread and they had so much left over, they forgot to bring bread.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 And Jesus on the boat starts teaching them.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Eight verse 15. Watch out. Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of the of Herod.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 But verse 16, they basically completely ignore him and they begin discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread.

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 So after all these huge miracles about bread and about feeding thousands of people, they still don't get it.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 They're on a boat now. Someone forgot to bring bread and they're arguing on a boat, completely missing the point of what Jesus is teaching them.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And they're still arguing about the bread.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 They saw it time and time again, yet they did not believe.

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 And so Jesus can't control himself anymore and he has to rebuke them.

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread?

131
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 Can you imagine the outrage of what Jesus is feeling right now?

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 I've shown you so much yet you still don't get.

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear?

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And do you not remember?

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 Then he actually asked them, when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets were left?

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 They said, twelve. And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets were left?

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 Seven. And he said to them, do you not understand?

139
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Do you not understand? And then Jesus, he was a blind man.

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And then there is the most incredible scene in Mark, chapter nine, the transfiguration.

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 He takes Peter, James and John up to the mountain and suddenly Elijah and Moses turn up.

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And it's just, I can imagine it's the most incredible mountaintop experience any human being has ever had.

143
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 They come back down from the mountain and there's chaos and there's people arguing.

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 And that's where that Lumo video just picks up.

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 And he sees people arguing because the other disciples who were left at the bottom of the mountain,

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 they were arguing because they were trying to figure out how to exercise this demon.

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And that is where we land today. Mark, chapter nine, verse 14 to 29.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Jesus heals a boy with an unclean spirit.

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 And he comes down. Imagine having that moment. The face is still glowing.

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 It was just the best mountaintop experience. They come down.

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 Yet people are arguing and the disciples that he left behind were now powerless.

152
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 They couldn't exercise this demon from this child who was foaming at the mouth, grinding his teeth.

153
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 This is, experts will say that this is the modern day epilepsy.

154
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 And of course, also possessed by a demon and the disciples, they couldn't do it.

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 They couldn't cast out the demon. And that's when, as we saw in the video, chapter nine, verse 19,

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 Jesus says, "Oh, faithless generation, how long am I to be with you?

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me."

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 And then they bring the child to him. And then Jesus asks a very personal question to the father.

159
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 As a caring doctor would ask a patient, "How long has he been suffering from this?"

160
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And the father, being like any parent who is just desperate, completely helpless,

161
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 and maybe even hopeless without running out of ideas, says, "He's been like this since childhood.

162
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 He's threatened to kill his life quite a few times."

163
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And that's where Jesus says, and then the father says, "But if you can do anything, have compassion on us."

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 And then Jesus almost takes offense. "If you can!" There's an exclamation mark there in chapter nine, verse 23.

165
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 "If you can!" "Of course I can." "All things are possible for one who believes."

166
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 "I can!" "But do you believe?" is what Jesus is saying.

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And then the father comes out with that line. "I believe. Help my unbelief."

168
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 Jesus commands the spirit to leave and never to return.

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 The boy then is left as a corpse. But then Jesus helps him up again.

170
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 And from there, the disciples go away and they go, "Jesus, why couldn't we do it?

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Earlier, when you sent us out, we actually had the authority to do it. We could do it."

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 Mark chapter six, "And he called the twelve, and they began to send them out two by two,

173
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. They could do it before.

174
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Jesus, why couldn't we do it anymore?" And that's when he says,

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 "This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer."

176
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 I want to go through all of these points today, but really, as I'm talking about how it is that

177
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 when we believe, it is only then do we see. I want to really ask us,

178
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 and I've been asking myself this, what kind of faith do I have?

179
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 What kind of faith do we have? As I've retold this story very, very quickly,

180
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 and please, as I've asked you to open the Bible, go back into these passages and look

181
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 and see the narrative that is going, see what Jesus has been doing.

182
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And I've introduced you to the Pharisees, to the disciples, and finally to this father.

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 What kind of faith do we have? As we look at these characters, as we look at these people,

184
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 these real-life people having gone through these things, ask ourselves the question,

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 which one of these people do we relate to the most? Do we have the faith of the Pharisees,

186
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 the disciples, or the father? What is our faith really like?

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 Are we actually, even though we say we believe in God, that we're still actually with our arms crossed

188
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 saying, "I need to see it to believe it." Or actually, do we have a really genuine faith

189
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 within our hearts where we go, "Actually, Jesus, we believe. Help our unbelief."

190
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 And so I want to pose these three different people to you and see which one of those you think you are the most.

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 So the first one is the Pharisees, the Pharisees. And that's where I just mentioned in chapter 8,

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 verse 11, "These Pharisees come and they begin to argue with him, and they seek from him a sign from heaven to test him."

193
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And Jesus, he says, verse 12, "And he sighs deeply in his spirit."

194
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 He's sad. His heart is broken, but they're still in this state. He's saying, "Why don't you get it?

195
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Why are you still looking for signs? I want a change of heart."

196
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 You see, because what Jesus knew is a closed heart leads to closed eyes.

197
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 That unless their hearts were open, nothing that they would see would convince them.

198
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 But he wanted them to see that they had a problem of the heart.

199
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 They had already decided not to believe. Do you know people like that?

200
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Maybe if you're talking to them about the faith, or maybe you were like that yourself,

201
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 or maybe even right now, there's still an element of that.

202
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 But you know what? I'm not going to believe.

203
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 I'm not going to commit my life to Jesus unless I see something really just supernatural,

204
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 something that I can't explain, a miracle.

205
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 But you see, Jesus refused to give those things because he knew that actually faith starts with a leap.

206
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 It starts from the heart with a leap.

207
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And it reminds us of this almost paradox of faith, that unless we recognize that God is present and acting in Jesus,

208
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 no testimony will persuade us. It's all about the heart.

209
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 We can do everything we can, but ultimately, faith is still this mysterious gift that comes from responding to God's word.

210
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 This one campaign, what do we remember? Faith comes by seeing?

211
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 No, it was in partnership with an organization called Faith Comes by Hearing, Romans chapter 10.

212
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Faith comes from us responding and hearing and responding to God's word.

213
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 And it's about the heart.

214
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 We don't simply see and then believe. That's not how it works.

215
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 So I don't know where you're at in your faith right now, whether you are really just waiting for God to show you something.

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Show me something impressive. Show me something cool.

217
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 Show me something that's out of my control. And maybe then I will believe you.

218
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Are you waiting for proof? Are you waiting to see him?

219
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Because if you are, then this story, the scripture tells us that actually you'll be waiting for a long time because it's about the heart.

220
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 You have to make that first step.

221
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 We see, we say we believe, but we actually sometimes don't want to see God work.

222
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 We don't want to see him in his full power because it would threaten to completely turn our lives upside down.

223
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 So we keep him at a distance and then we wonder why we don't feel his presence.

224
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 See, do we actually still like to be in control?

225
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 Are we actually frightened to open our hearts?

226
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Because we know that if we opened our hearts, it wouldn't be in our control anymore.

227
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Do we only like the idea of a God that we can control?

228
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 You see, a closed heart leads to closed eyes.

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And I'm wondering whether for myself or any of us here that our faith is one that is still close.

230
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 It is still hard. We are still waiting to be impressed.

231
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 We are still waiting for this vending machine God to churn out the things that we want him to give us.

232
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 I was reminded when I was learning how to drive in the UK.

233
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 I'm sure it's the same here as well.

234
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 As you're sitting in the steering wheel driving, you would then have the instructor who would have his own brakes.

235
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 And there would be some cars where actually you could have the actual instructor would have a steering wheel just in case you go crazy and then they can save your life.

236
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 And I wonder whether we have that sometimes where we say, Jesus, take the steering wheel.

237
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 I believe in you. I trust you.

238
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 But actually, we are still very much holding on to the steering wheel ourselves.

239
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 We actually don't really trust him.

240
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 We actually don't really want him to be driving and taking control.

241
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 But yet that's what that's what God is asking us to do.

242
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 We have to open our hearts to him.

243
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Another example, one of my favorite toys growing up was a, I love driving, was a literally a fake steering wheel toy that I could sit at the back of the car and the passenger seat in the back.

244
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 It would kind of like suction to the window and I'd pretend I'd be driving.

245
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 And I wonder, I wonder how many of us have truly surrendered the steering wheel to God.

246
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Like truly, truly opened our hearts to him.

247
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 Because I think only when we truly open our hearts to him, do we then actually get to see him.

248
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 But if we don't open our hearts, then we actually don't get to see him clearly.

249
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 How is your faith? What kind of faith do you have?

250
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 Is it similar to the ones of the Pharisees?

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 If it is, I encourage you, let go.

252
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Let go.

253
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 You will only see if you believe.

254
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 It is your believing that starts you on this journey to eventually see God.

255
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 Number two, the disciples.

256
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Or do you have a faith of disciples?

257
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 Have we seen and experienced God, but actually forgotten and have hardened our hearts still?

258
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 Do we have a faithless faith?

259
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Jesus asks the disciples, do you not yet perceive or understand?

260
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Are your hearts hardened, having eyes?

261
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Do you not see and having ears?

262
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 Do you not hear?

263
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 And do you not remember?

264
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 It wasn't that long ago.

265
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Do you not remember?

266
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 Forgetfulness is a key.

267
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 I'm just going to exit the screen so you can see me more clearly.

268
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Do we have the faith of the disciples where actually God has been working in our lives, but we keep forgetting?

269
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 A faithless faith is no faith at all.

270
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 That's something that God has been just convicting me about, asking, James, do you really have faith in me?

271
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Like, really, really?

272
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Are you truly letting me drive this car?

273
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Or are you actually still holding on?

274
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Do we have a faithless faith?

275
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Are our hearts hardened and preventing us to see what God is actually doing?

276
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 The disciples, they had seen so much.

277
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 And this thing about the bread, whether it's the 5,000 or the 4,000 or then going on a boat and forgetting, they couldn't seem to get it into their minds that Jesus was able to provide for them.

278
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 You see, they have the right factual answers.

279
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 When Jesus asked them, hey, how many baskets were left?

280
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 12.

281
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 How many baskets were left this time?

282
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 Seven.

283
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 They knew the right answers, but they hadn't let it seep into their hearts.

284
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 They didn't really truly understand what was happening.

285
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And Jesus posed them this question, do you not yet understand?

286
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And then he leaves.

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 He leaves it.

288
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 He doesn't explain it to them.

289
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 You see, when it comes to faith, it's something that you have to come to terms with yourself.

290
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Not only does Jesus leave them with that question, but the writer Mark leaves us there as well.

291
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Do you not yet understand?

292
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 You see, faith is something that we have to come to terms with ourselves, that we have to figure out, and that we have to be the ones to take that leap.

293
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Have our hearts become hardened?

294
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Have we missed God working in our lives and forgotten?

295
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And we can become numb to it.

296
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 And in fact, that was what Jesus was trying to say, hey, beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the Herod.

297
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Beware of the things that make your heart numb.

298
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 Beware of the things that make you deaf to God.

299
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 Because those things, once you've, if you let those things into your life, and what are those things?

300
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 What are the things that make us numb and deaf to the gospel?

301
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Media, public opinion, ideologies that are popular in this day and age.

302
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Anything in this world makes us become numb to the gospel.

303
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 And then we end up with a faithless faith.

304
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 And that's not something that we want.

305
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 The key here is forgetfulness.

306
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Jesus says, do you not remember what I've been doing?

307
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 And these disciples, they kept seeing things over and over again, yet they still, they would forget.

308
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 They would not understand.

309
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 And it reminded me, actually, there was a time when, maybe this is nearly three years ago now,

310
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 when we first had the conversation about potentially God bringing us to Hong Kong.

311
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 I remember sitting in this pub.

312
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 I'm sure I've told this story to some people already.

313
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 There's a pub chain in the UK called Weatherspoons.

314
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And I used to go to, John's nodding.

315
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 John has been to Weatherspoons many, many times, probably more than he went to church.

316
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 And I used to love preparing my sermons there on a morning.

317
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 I used to sit Tuesday morning with the other very sorry and sad people who were in the pub at that time of the day.

318
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 And I'd be preparing sermons there.

319
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 And whilst I was preparing the sermon, I was just, my head was just all over the place because I was wondering, God, seriously, Hong Kong?

320
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 Like, that's crazy.

321
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 That doesn't make sense.

322
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 What am I going to do there?

323
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 What's it going to look like?

324
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 It's going to be, I'm just worried and I'm scared.

325
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 And I remember this song came on.

326
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And this song came on in my headphones.

327
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 And it's a song called "You're Not Finished Yet."

328
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And I want to read the lyrics to you because the lyrics were really what got me in that morning, that Tuesday morning in Weatherspoons.

329
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 God broke me.

330
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 God broke me.

331
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And I was just in tears.

332
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 I was familiar with people crying.

333
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 But I was just sitting and I was just bawling.

334
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 And these were the lyrics that I was listening to.

335
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 I won't forget the things you've done.

336
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 For I know that this is just the beginning.

337
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And you're not finished yet.

338
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
 Until I see your promise come, God, with all I am, I'll keep believing that you're not finished yet.

339
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 I've only known you to keep your word.

340
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 I've only found love at every turn.

341
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 I can trust you here.

342
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 You're not finished yet.

343
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 And you know, those words, "I've only known you to keep your word.

344
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 I've only found love at every turn."

345
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 For me, those were the words that broke me.

346
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 Because God, I'm asking God all these questions.

347
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 What are we going to do?

348
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 I guess it sounds just as stupid as the disciples.

349
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 Where are we going to get the bread from?

350
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 Even though I've just seen you doing so many miracles with bread.

351
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 But I guess maybe looking back now, those questions that I had, "Oh, where are we going to live?

352
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Where are our kids going to go to school?

353
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 How are our lives going to be like?"

354
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 God's saying, "James, I've shown you time and time again I will keep my word, that I'm faithful, that I'm good,

355
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 that I will provide for you.

356
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 There is no calling that I'm going to call you to without providing for you.

357
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 I've only known you to keep your word.

358
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 I've only found love at every turn."

359
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And I was just like, my heart was just repenting at that moment, just going, "God, why do I keep forgetting?

360
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 Why do I keep forgetting that you are good, that you provide?

361
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 Why do I have such a faithless faith?"

362
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Now, this faithless faith is toxic because we think we're believing, but we're actually, we're not surrendering anything.

363
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And we just keep living our lives.

364
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And then we wonder why God's not really in our life.

365
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 And we wonder why we don't see God doing amazing things, but we haven't let him.

366
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 And we're wondering why we're not going to amazing places, but we keep holding the steering wheel.

367
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 And we don't know how to get there ourselves.

368
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 The key here is, do we have that kind of faith?

369
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Do we have that kind of faith that the disciples had?

370
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 Are we always forgetting?

371
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 And I pray, I pray for me, I pray for you over the screen, that God would continually soften your heart,

372
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 that God would remind you of all the things he's done.

373
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 And I don't know in your life right now, whether you're at a crossroad, whether you're waiting for something to happen,

374
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 whether you're waiting for God to come through somehow or show you the way, show you the next step, whatever it is,

375
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 God's got you.

376
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 The fact that you're sat here is a testament to the fact that God's got you.

377
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:54,000
 Now, you may not have your situation under control, but reminding yourself that God is under control.

378
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 Have that kind of faith.

379
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 Don't be like the disciples.

380
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 And the final person that I wanted to focus on is the father.

381
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 The father.

382
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 The father who comes to God completely out of ideas, having struggled with this for probably years with his kid.

383
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 And then he goes, God, if you can do anything, have compassion on us and just help us, please.

384
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Your disciples can do it.

385
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 Just help us, please, if you can.

386
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 And then Jesus says, if I can, anything is possible.

387
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And the father says, Lord, I believe.

388
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 Help my unbelief.

389
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 I believe in a God who is bigger than our unbelief.

390
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 You see, this son who couldn't be healed by the disciples because they weren't fully connected with Jesus, and I'll talk more about that in a little bit.

391
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 But then the father recognizes that his faith is flawed.

392
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And this is the comfort.

393
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 This is the encouragement for all of us, that we don't need to have 100% pure faith for God to act.

394
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 And that's showing us here that there is room for doubt.

395
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 Lord, I believe.

396
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Help my unbelief.

397
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 It's riddled with doubt.

398
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 Doubt and faith are often mixed together.

399
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 And that is okay.

400
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
 I don't know where you are at right now in your faith.

401
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 But the first step, as this father shows us, is just taking that to the Lord and saying, I believe.

402
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 I really want to believe.

403
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 But I still am filled with so much doubt.

404
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 And I think that perfect faith is enough because we're not the ones that have to be perfect.

405
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 We have faith in the one who is perfect.

406
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 So I want to encourage you.

407
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 Say what that father says to God.

408
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 Say it maybe even every day.

409
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 Lord, I believe.

410
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Help my unbelief.

411
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 I give this day to you.

412
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 I don't know where you're going to come through.

413
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 I don't even know if you will.

414
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 But I'm going to -- I want to show you this is where my heart is.

415
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 This is where my heart is.

416
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 It's that moment of surrender.

417
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 I remember coming back that morning and I had in the pub where I was finally getting to that place of surrender.

418
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 I still didn't know what was going to happen.

419
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I still didn't know the different steps that were going to take place in order for us to get to Hong Kong and all the things that were going to happen.

420
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 I still didn't know any of those things.

421
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 I didn't even know the nature of the challenge that was ahead.

422
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Yet at that moment I was reminded of the nature of God.

423
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 I didn't know the nature of the challenge that was ahead when I came here.

424
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Yet at that moment I was reminded of the nature of God.

425
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 And that was enough.

426
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 And that was where I was able to say, you know what, God, I really don't know.

427
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 I really don't know.

428
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 And I still have doubt in my will of this.

429
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 And I left that pub still wondering what are we going to do?

430
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 How is it going to work?

431
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 But I now was reminded that this God is bigger than my unbelief.

432
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 That I had seen him come through time and time again.

433
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 And that he wasn't going to fail me now.

434
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 It's saying, I believe, help my unbelief.

435
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Jesus doesn't demand absolute faith, brothers and sisters.

436
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 He didn't demand it from the father, from the boy, or even from Jairus.

437
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Jesus says, just come to me and say, I believe, help my unbelief.

438
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 The father is saying here, help me just as I am.

439
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Flaws and all. I am a doubter.

440
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 Yet I choose to put my faith in you.

441
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 My flawed faith. My broken faith.

442
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 My unbelieving faith in you.

443
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 And his very coming to Jesus was enough.

444
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 And that is what Jesus asks of us.

445
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 And Jesus here is saying, the way you're going to see me is to have faith.

446
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 And I don't know if you guys have been at a place where you really want to see Jesus.

447
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 And so I believe the message for us today is Jesus is saying to us, if you want to see me,

448
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 you first have to have faith in me.

449
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 You have to believe in me.

450
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 And you don't obtain or achieve this faith.

451
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 It's not something that you can actually work for.

452
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 It starts with you opening up your hands and just saying, I believe, help my unbelief.

453
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 It starts from a place of surrender of the heart.

454
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 Of truly letting go.

455
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Jesus says that if your heart isn't right, if it's like the Pharisees,

456
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 even if you see someone rise from the dead, you still wouldn't believe.

457
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 Because your faith starts from your heart and not your eyes.

458
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 It starts from your heart.

459
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 But if you open your heart, then you will see the empty tomb.

460
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Then you will start seeing the beauty of nature.

461
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 You will start seeing the beauty in people.

462
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 And you'll start seeing the living God in the form of Jesus.

463
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 And you'll recognize that it's because of him that you live.

464
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 And you'll see that you can still have doubt.

465
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 But just like this father, you can declare, I believe, Lord, help my unbelief.

466
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 And God does an amazing thing.

467
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 I'll tell you what he does.

468
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 He comes and meets you where you're at.

469
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 In the form of Jesus.

470
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And he will show you, he will show you that he is good.

471
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 That he will come through for you at every turn.

472
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 And all you'll see is love.

473
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 You know, my question really to all of us is,

474
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 What is there in our lives where we've come to the end of ourselves?

475
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 We can't fix these problems.

476
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 We've recognized finally that we are out of control.

477
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 We've exhausted every avenue.

478
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Stuff that maybe we could do before, but now we're just finding so much harder.

479
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 We know our limits.

480
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 Jesus is telling us, hey, stay connected to me.

481
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 That's what he's saying to the disciples.

482
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Because the disciples are shocked.

483
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 They could cast out demons before, but now they couldn't.

484
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 And they're asking, Jesus, what's so special about this song?

485
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 He's saying, this kind can only be carried out by prayer.

486
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 What does that mean?

487
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 That means this kind can only be carried out when you are fully connected to me.

488
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 As soon as you think you can do this on your own, then you won't be able to do it.

489
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Prayer is us coming before Jesus and saying, I just want to be with you.

490
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 I just want to speak to you.

491
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 I just want to be connected to you.

492
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.

493
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 So my question to all of us is, as we go about our days, as we go about our lives,

494
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 how reliant upon Jesus are we really?

495
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 How much faith are we putting in ourselves?

496
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 And how much faith are we putting in him?

497
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 And if we're putting a lot of faith in ourselves, then there's no wonder why we're failing.

498
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 There's no wonder why we're always so anxious.

499
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 But if we put our faith in Jesus, then that is different.

500
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 So the call for us is to let go of that steering wheel, saying that I don't got this,

501
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 but God's got this.

502
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Got Jesus saying to us, let go, let me.

503
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 And I have a final question, and this is something that I only really added on this afternoon,

504
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 is someone in our congregation has really been struggling.

505
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 And actually last night I was just in a place where I was just like, we're just praying,

506
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 and we're believing that God, you will do something, that you will heal,

507
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 that you will bring relief and comfort and health to this dear brother and this family.

508
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 And it's not happening yet.

509
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And I'm looking at this story, and I'm seeing, wow, Jesus says, hey,

510
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 all things are possible for one who believes.

511
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 And there still comes a time where we say we believe.

512
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 We say that we have our doubts, but yet Jesus still doesn't come through.

513
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 What if we're trying to believe, but we're still not seeing any results?

514
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 I don't know whether you're at that point, whether there's something in your life that you have.

515
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 But you know what, James, I do believe, and I do doubt, and I take all that before God,

516
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 and I keep praying, but somehow it's still not happening.

517
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 I'm not seeing the results that I'm really praying for.

518
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 I'm not really seeing God come through in this situation yet.

519
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 We're not seeing any healings or miracles.

520
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 This boy was healed from epilepsy and freed from the demon, but why isn't God answering my prayer?

521
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 Why isn't God answering the deepest cries of my heart yet?

522
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
 The truth is I don't know the answer to that one.

523
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 I don't know why God chooses to heal some and not others.

524
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 Only he knows.

525
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 That's why he's God.

526
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 But what I do know is that in all things, God works for the good of those who love him.

527
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 And our faith in him isn't in him doing something for us.

528
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 Our faith is in the fact that he's already done it.

529
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Our faith isn't in him trying to-- in him doing something for us now,

530
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 but our faith is in the fact that he has already done it.

531
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Our faith is in the resurrection, that he really did come, that he really did die,

532
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
 and that he really did rise again.

533
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 And because he rose again, that gives us faith that there is something beyond the grave,

534
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 that this earthly death, this earthly pain isn't all there is.

535
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 In fact, even when we have faith and belief, we will still face death.

536
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 We will still face pain.

537
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
 We will still face sickness.

538
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 But our faith isn't in deliverance from those things, but in something bigger, in something more.

539
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 We believe that what happened 2,000 years ago really did happen,

540
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 and we believe in the promise that he will return again,

541
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 and that there one day will be a place that we will see where there are no more tears,

542
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 no more death, and no more pain.

543
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 Believing is seeing.

544
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 We believe in what Jesus accomplished on the cross,

545
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 and it is that belief that allows us to one day see him again.

546
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 You see, the true point of why we're believing isn't for God to show up in our lives right now.

547
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 It's for us to be able to see him again.

548
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 So, brothers and sisters, as you choose to have faith,

549
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 cast your eyes even further than just God delivering you from whatever circumstances you have here.

550
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 The reason you have faith, the reason you believe is not to see miracles, but it's to see Jesus,

551
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 and our faith is that one day we will see him again in his rightful place, in all his glory,

552
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 that is what we have faith in,

553
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 and that gives us the strength to face the light momentary afflictions of this world,

554
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 because they are nothing when compared to the eternal weight of glory that awaits us.

555
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
 Our belief will ultimately allow us to see God himself,

556
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 and that is a faith worth holding on to.

557
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Can I pray for us all?

558
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 (Praying)

559
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 Jesus, you seem to have gotten frustrated at the Pharisees and the disciples when they lose faith in you,

560
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 and I can only imagine how frustrating it is for you to look at us and look at us go about our lives and our worries,

561
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,000
 when time and time again you have come through for us, yet we forget, yet our hearts are hard,

562
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:18,000
 yet we simply just choose to put faith in ourselves, and then we fail, and then we wonder why things look so gloomy,

563
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 and we repent of that, Jesus, and we don't want to faith like the Pharisees,

564
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 but we're also reminded actually, the disciples, they weren't in a great place then,

565
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 but they soon saw, and they soon believed, and they ended up transforming the world,

566
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 and that you used broken faith, you used doubting faith,

567
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 to end up transforming the world and ushering your kingdom into this world.

568
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 So Lord, come to us, meet us where we are at, and I pray for every person on this Zoom call who's watching over YouTube,

569
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 that you know the deepest fears of our hearts, you know where our faith is, you know whether we trust in you at all or not,

570
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 but it's at that point we know that you come to us, and it's at that point, Lord, your Spirit can get us to that point where we can say,

571
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 just like what that father said, "Lord, I believe, help my unbelief, I believe, help my unbelief."

572
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 And I pray that that awareness, that confession is what spurs us on to a bigger and greater faith,

573
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
 and that confession is what ultimately allows us to see you again.

574
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
 So we thank you, Jesus, and it's in your name we pray. Amen.
