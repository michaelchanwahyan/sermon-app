1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 (Applause)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Awesome!

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 And so we're starting this road toward Lent,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 and Lent is a time that we just want to calm down,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 we want to slow down.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 As we head towards Easter,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 we want to head towards our Creator,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 and we want to offer more and more time towards Him.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And so Lent is often the time where we start to think

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 to give up something.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Some people might give up, I don't know, Instagram,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 some people might give up meat,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 as they prepare themselves to understand

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 what Christ also went through.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 That He Himself gave up the most precious thing,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 and which was His life.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 And so we're entering into a series of parables,

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 and the first parable we're going through today

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 is the parable of the Good Samaritan.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And so you saw in the video there, great video,

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 we're doing the one app together,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 and it's going to lead us towards Lent.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And so as you saw in the video,

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 this story started with the Pharisees, right?

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 The teachers of the law, and they were questioning Jesus, right?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 They were threatened by Jesus, His authority,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 His miracles, His power.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 They wanted to sort of trap Him.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 And this one person, maybe he was actually curious,

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 or maybe he actually wanted to trap Jesus,

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 but how can I inherit eternal life?

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And Jesus says, "What do you think?"

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Well, it's great, you know, just dialogue, right?

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 He said, "Well, what do you think?"

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Well, you gotta love the Lord, our God,

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 with all our heart, mind, soul, strength, everything.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 And then we gotta love our neighbor as ourselves.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And Jesus asks, well, He asks, "Who is my neighbor?"

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And so Jesus says this story.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Now, we don't know if it was a made-up story,

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 but it was also very common back then

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 that people would travel from Jerusalem to Jericho, right?

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And the Israel team, did you guys walk from Israel to Jericho?

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Did you guys do that walk? No? Too far of a walk?

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Okay, too far of a walk.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Well, as you see, the walk is not very foresty.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 The walk is quite barren, actually, quite barren.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And as you see in the next slide,

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 it's also, the elevation is quite high.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 So Jerusalem is approximately 800 meters higher than Jericho, right?

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Jericho obviously was known for, you know,

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 that big walled city, right, that was destroyed.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 And so, as you see in the next slide,

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 it's around a seven and a half, seven hour walk

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 from Jerusalem down to Jericho.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Anybody wanna do a seven and a half hour walk?

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Yeah, okay, Hanani wants to do it. Very good.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 It might be quite hot in Jerusalem right now, quite hot.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Like the Hong Kong summers, maybe not as humid or maybe just as humid.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 So they would know exactly what Jesus was talking about,

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 walking from Jerusalem to Jericho, not uncommon.

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 The thing about this place was that it was very barren.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 There was mountains and different hills and valleys among the way.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And so it would be easy for people to hide

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 and also to attack you, right?

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 And so I don't know if you've watched some of these TV shows

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 like Walking Dead or Mad Max or something like that.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 You know the apocalypse, right? They love that.

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 There's no like police system in the apocalypse,

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 the zombie land, you don't know who's there, right?

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Have you guys watched some of these TV shows?

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 So they're taking a stroll through this new territory,

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 they don't know, they see somebody there

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 and then somebody pops up and robs them.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Yeah, they're easy targets, they don't know where they're going.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 They don't know who, this new place, they don't know.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And in the same way, this new place, well that's not new place,

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 but this place was known to be possibly places where you could get robbed.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 Alright? It was a desolate place,

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 there was nothing really between Jericho and Jerusalem

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 and people could run away, rob you and run away

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 or they could hide and wait for you to come.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And so on this particular, in this particular story,

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Jesus is talking about this person that is taking a walk

85
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 from Jerusalem down to Jericho.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 And he is robbed, he is beaten, he is stripped

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 and he is left there, left for dead, left for dead.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 And there's three characters that come.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 And so the first character, who's the first character?

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 The priest, okay? The priest.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And so what do we know about priests back then?

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Well, they had to be direct descendants of Aaron.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Aaron is the brother of Moses and Aaron was the first priest.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Okay? And so imagine in this society,

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 the theocral society,

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 society where God is the head,

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 the priests were very important.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 They had a lot of power, they had a lot of responsibility,

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 they were highly respected.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 And the high priest was the leader among the priests.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 And the high priest, once a year, had the responsibility

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 of going into the Holy of Holies to get atonement for Israel.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 The Holy of Holies is the very special place within the temple.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 And if you were not pure and holy before the Lord,

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 what would happen to the priest?

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 You would drop dead.

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 And so the priest, imagine the church, within this church,

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 imagine the church is the city or the country.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 Who is sort of leading the country or the church?

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 It's the senior pastor.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And so in the same way, the high priest was like the senior pastor.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And so let's look at the diagram of the society back then,

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 the cultural society back then.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 So the priests were sort of the hierarchy.

115
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 And under the priests were the Levites.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 And under the Levites, as you see, the Levites,

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 the priests and the Sadducees were another sect of priests

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 that focused on another thing.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And then on the other side were the Pharisees,

120
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 where they were the lawyers, the laws.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 They knew the laws very well.

122
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 And you look at the next slide.

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 So the priests were sort of the most important

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 or had the highest position in society.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 And then it was the Levites, and then it was the Jews,

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 and the Samaritans were the lowest in the society.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 Okay, so next, the Levites.

128
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Who were the Levites?

129
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 They had to be born of the tribe of the Levites, yes.

130
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 And so they could study their way

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 and possibly gain higher and higher position

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 within the Levite system.

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 And so, for example, you had the senior pastor or the pastors,

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 which are sort of the high priest or the priests, right?

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 And the Levites would be sort of the workers within the church.

136
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 So the Levites would help build the church,

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 they would help clean the church,

138
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 they would help carry the ark,

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 they would help in different rituals within the temple.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 And so this was the role of the Levites.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 They were the second, sort of the second highest position

142
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 within that society.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 And so both of them were very important.

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 High, respected people within society.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 And then the third character in this story is who?

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Who is the third character in this story?

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 The Samaritan.

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Now, do you remember a couple of weeks or a month ago,

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I talked about a Samaritan woman, right?

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And Jesus had an interaction with the Samaritan woman.

151
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 And in this story, I outlined the different difficulties

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 that Jesus faced with interacting with this woman.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Firstly, Jesus was a man, and not just any man,

154
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 he was a man of respected, he was respected like a teacher.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 The Samaritan was an outcast.

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 But what is more important is the relationship

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 between Jews and the Samaritans.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 Do you guys remember what the relationship was?

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Were they best buds?

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 Were they like Americans and Canadians, best buds?

161
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 No, they weren't, right?

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 They were sort of like modern day Israel and Palestine,

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 they didn't like each other.

164
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 They were fighting with each other.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Israel looked, Jews looked down on Samaritans.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Why did they look down on them?

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 Because they were impure.

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 They were intermixed, they were interbred

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 with their enemy back then, which were the Assyrians.

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And so they looked down on the Samaritans.

171
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And religiously, the Samaritans also were not allowed

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 into the temple, not allowed into Jerusalem,

173
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 because they were considered impure, right? Impure.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 And so this Samaritan in this story was the same.

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 He was considered an outcast, he was impure.

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 He was a half Gentile and a half Jew.

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And so they were looked down upon by the Jews.

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 So there's three people in this story.

179
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 The priest walks by, right?

180
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 The Levite walks by and sees this man,

181
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 half dead, stripped, beaten.

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 And then the Samaritan also comes and walks by.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 And so a lot of the times, we look at this story

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 and the classic thing is to say, "Who are we in this story?"

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 Are we the high priest and the Levite,

186
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 as you see in the next slide?

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 Who are we in this story?

188
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 Are we the high priest?

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Are we the Levite in this story?

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
 Or are we the Samaritan in this story?

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 Well, in some occasions, well, honestly,

192
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 we are all three in some situations.

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 We are all three in some situations.

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 The high priest and the Levite,

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 they are known to be of high position,

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 highly respected, religious, they're looked up upon.

197
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 But yet in this situation, we see in the next slide,

198
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 they act selfishly.

199
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 They act selfishly. How are they acting selfishly?

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 Well, they see this person, half dead, right?

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 They don't know if this person is alive.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 And so back then, if you touched a corpse or a dead person,

203
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 what would happen to you?

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 You would become unclean, unclean.

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 And you would need to go through a period of quarantine, okay?

206
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 14-day quarantine in a hotel.

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 No, I'm just joking, right?

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 You would have to separate yourself from the temple

209
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 or from serving for a period of time

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 because you would become unclean.

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 And so they were selfish.

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 They were looking out for themselves.

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 They didn't want to go through this body.

214
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 They want to jeopardize their own status

215
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 or their ability to serve in the church or in the temple back then.

216
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 And also, they had the idea of self-preservation.

217
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 Self-preservation.

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 What were they worried about?

219
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 What would they possibly be worried about?

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 Being robbed, right?

221
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 Well, if this person is robbed,

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 maybe the robbers are nearby,

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 and they're staking out me, the next person who is coming.

224
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 So possibly, they are trying to just walk pie quickly, right?

225
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Not get hurt, not get robbed, get out of this situation,

226
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 arrive to their next destination safely.

227
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Self-preservation.

228
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 They didn't want to go down there and help this person

229
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 in fear that somebody might attack them.

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And a lot of the situations, we've also been through that, right?

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 We might have walked by the street

232
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 and seen some homeless people who needed help.

233
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 And we're like, "Oh, we don't have time.

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 We're going to church.

235
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 We don't have time.

236
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 We're late for our church meeting."

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Or somebody is asking us for food,

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 and we just sort of look the other way,

239
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 and pretend we don't see them.

240
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 And unfortunately, we've been there.

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 We've been there.

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 I used to drive in Toronto,

243
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 and as I drove towards the downtown area,

244
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 there was this one traffic light.

245
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 And this one traffic light, there would always be beggars

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 that come out to ask you for money

247
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 when you stopped at that traffic light.

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 They would take their cup and be like,

249
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 "Hey, do you have money? Do you have any?

250
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Do you have money? Knock on the next car.

251
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Do you have money?"

252
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 And I knew.

253
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And I knew.

254
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 So I would have granola bars.

255
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 I would have fruit ready to give to them

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 because I knew they were coming.

257
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 And so sometimes they would take it.

258
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 Sometimes they were like, "Oh, no. I don't want it."

259
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 And that's their choice.

260
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 So I sort of prepared for these people.

261
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 I knew they were coming, and I wanted to help them,

262
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 and I wanted to give them some food

263
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 and see if they would take it.

264
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 But a lot of times, people might ignore them.

265
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 A lot of times, people might ignore them.

266
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 And I remember this one story.

267
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 One of my friends was sick in the MTR, right?

268
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 And she was so sick to the point

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 where she sort of fainted and passed out.

270
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 And what do you think people did in the MTR?

271
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 What do you think people did in the MTR?

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 They ran away.

273
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 They ran away.

274
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 They thought she had COVID.

275
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 They had some sort of disease.

276
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 They were separating themselves, right?

277
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 Like she had some sort of magic force field around her.

278
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 And then eventually what happened was

279
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 the MTR people came and helped her

280
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 and got her to the hospital and helped her.

281
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 But this is sort of like what was happening here

282
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 with the Levites and the high priest or the priest.

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 They saw this person.

284
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 They didn't know what this person had.

285
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 Maybe they had COVID.

286
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 No, they didn't have COVID back then.

287
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And they wanted to run away.

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 They were self-preservation.

289
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 They were focused on self-preservation,

290
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 and they were focused on themselves.

291
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 They didn't want their status

292
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 or their reputation to be ruined, right?

293
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 And so next, what happened?

294
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 There was a Samaritan that came by.

295
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 And the Samaritan wasn't focused on himself.

296
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 This person wasn't focused on his own selfishness

297
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 and self-preservation,

298
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 but he was focused on being selfless.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 He saw this person and helped him,

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 went to him, bandaged him up,

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 brought him onto the donkey,

302
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 and took him to a place of sanctuary, of recovery.

303
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And at times, we are also like this Samaritan person, right?

304
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 We've gone through some times

305
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 where we've went to the Mongkok area

306
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 to hand out sandwiches,

307
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 hand out food boxes to the poor, to the needy,

308
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 people that are living in those walkways

309
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 or those tunnelways in Hong Kong.

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 And we've gone out, we've lended our hand,

311
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 we've prayed for these people.

312
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 We've gone out weekly to hand out sandwiches to these people.

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 And so the classic understanding of this parable is,

314
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 who are we?

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 Are we the priest? Are we the Levite?

316
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Or are we the Samaritan that goes out mercifully

317
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 to help those in need,

318
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 to help our neighbor?

319
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Who is our neighbor?

320
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 Our neighbor is the person that is in need, right?

321
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Helping those that we see,

322
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 the people around us that are in need.

323
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 There's another sort of side to this story.

324
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 There's another side to this story.

325
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 And it's not looking at who are we

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 as the priest, as the Levite, as the Samaritan.

327
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 But it's to understand that in fact,

328
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 we are the victim.

329
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 We are the victim in this story.

330
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Have you thought about it?

331
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 That you are the one that is beaten,

332
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 robbed, stripped in this story.

333
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 You are the one that is left half dead.

334
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Can you imagine? You are that person.

335
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And we are in need of a good Samaritan.

336
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 We are in need of a good Samaritan.

337
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Who has robbed us?

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Who has beaten us?

339
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Who has stripped us?

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Who has stripped us?

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Who has left us helpless?

342
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Ultimately, it is a three-letter word.

343
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 It starts with an S.

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 Sin.

345
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 Sin has left us beaten, broken, stripped, and helpless.

346
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
 A month ago, we went through the testings of Jesus, right?

347
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 How He went through all the testings of this world.

348
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 The temptations of this world.

349
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
 The temptation of the flesh, our hedonism.

350
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 The temptation of our eyes, materialism.

351
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 We see it and we want it.

352
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 The temptation of our pride, egoism.

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And yet, Jesus was that person

354
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 that went through all these temptations,

355
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 and yet, He was without sin.

356
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 He held that weight.

357
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 That weight of temptation.

358
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 And yet, He did not drop that power bar.

359
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 He did not.

360
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 He was without sin.

361
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 And we went through that ultimately,

362
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 the testing of our flesh is lust,

363
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 gluttony, sloth, pride.

364
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 Lust leaves us sexually impure, right?

365
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 We have unrestrained sexual craving,

366
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 and that leaves us impure in the eyes of God.

367
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 Gluttony leaves us physically broken

368
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 because our physical body is not working

369
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 the way that God has designed it.

370
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 We are becoming overweight.

371
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 We are stuffing ourselves with things,

372
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 overindulging ourselves.

373
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 Sloth is in the same, but in the opposite direction.

374
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 We are becoming lazy and lack of effort.

375
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
 This leaves us broken.

376
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 It could leave us financially broken

377
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 because we become lazy and raft.

378
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 It could lead to things that we do out of raft.

379
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Broken relationships.

380
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 Hurting ourselves even.

381
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 This leaves us to brokenness.

382
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Greed leaves us to desire things excessively.

383
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And ultimately, that leaves us broken, empty.

384
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 We search for money, money, money.

385
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 We search for materialism, materialism.

386
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 And ultimately, these things leave us empty.

387
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 And some of you have been through it.

388
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 You've gone to the highest peak financially.

389
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 And at the end of it, money comes, money goes.

390
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 You've gone through all the money,

391
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 all the materialism in the world,

392
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 all the bags, all the watches,

393
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 all the shoes in the world.

394
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 But at the end of it, it's emptiness.

395
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 It's emptiness.

396
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 And there's envy, which leaves us broken

397
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 in our relationship with others

398
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 because we're jealous or we envy what other people have.

399
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 And it leaves ourselves broken.

400
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 And finally, there's pride.

401
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 Pride leaves us ultimately broken

402
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 because we believe we are right.

403
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 And we believe we are right over God.

404
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 We are right over God.

405
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 And so sin beats us, strips us,

406
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 leaves us helpless, half dead.

407
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 We are physically broken, materially broke.

408
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Mentally, we are broken, depressed.

409
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 And we have broken relationships.

410
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 We are the victim in this story.

411
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 We are the victim in this story.

412
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 I had a friend.

413
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 And you know how most gentlemen are, right?

414
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
 They don't talk about their issues.

415
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 You guys like that?

416
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Don't talk about their issues, right?

417
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
 You put up, "I'm a 'Tai Lam Yin'," right?

418
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 "Tai Lam Yin."

419
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 It's hard for them to talk about issues.

420
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And so when he called me,

421
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 and I was like, "Hey, I really need to talk."

422
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 I was like, "Oh, what's up?"

423
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Right?

424
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 And he was emotionally and spiritually very low

425
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 because he was reading scripture

426
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 and God convicted him of all the sin

427
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 that he had been going through.

428
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 He was in a past church,

429
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 and he didn't stay at that church

430
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
 because there were so many relationships

431
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 that he had conflict with.

432
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And instead of solving those conflicts,

433
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 he just wanted to escape.

434
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 He escaped, and that left broken relationships.

435
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 And he recalled all the bad things he said

436
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 to his sister and to his family

437
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 and the hurtful things that he said.

438
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 And he was like, "I'm so broken.

439
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 "Spiritually, I'm broken.

440
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 "These relationships are broken,

441
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 "and I have not faced any of the issues

442
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 "that I've gone through."

443
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 And he's like, "I don't know where I'm heading

444
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 "in my future, and all I'm doing

445
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 "is just going after my flesh

446
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 "that my human wants,

447
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 "and I'm not placing God first,

448
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 "and I'm feeling broken inside."

449
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 He's feeling broken,

450
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 and he was like this man

451
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 that was beaten, stripped,

452
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 left for dead, robbed.

453
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 He was like this person.

454
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 I recall another friend

455
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 that I spent time with this week,

456
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 and he was telling me about his family.

457
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 He married a girl,

458
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 and now they have a son.

459
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 But this woman goes through sort of bipolar

460
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 and goes through different mental illnesses,

461
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 and she has fits of rage

462
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 where this relationship has become abusive.

463
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 She's very abusive,

464
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 calling him names every day

465
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 and taking it out on their son,

466
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 taking it out on him.

467
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 And sin, the brokenness of this world

468
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 has caused brokenness in this family.

469
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 And now he doesn't know what to do,

470
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 but he thinks the only thing to do

471
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 is separation

472
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 because of the abuse in this family

473
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 of his wife onto him

474
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 and calling him names

475
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 and taking it out on his son.

476
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 There's brokenness in this family.

477
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 It's left him robbed, beaten, broken,

478
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 not knowing what to do.

479
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 And he's lost faith in God.

480
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 He's like, "Johnny, I don't believe in prayer anymore.

481
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 "I don't believe in prayer anymore.

482
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 "I'm so broken.

483
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 "I've been in this relationship, marriage,

484
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 "for five years,

485
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 "and I've been trying to fix it.

486
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 "I've been praying to God,

487
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 "and I'm just so desperate.

488
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
 "I don't know what to do anymore."

489
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 Broken, beaten, physically broke,

490
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 materially broke, mentally broken,

491
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 broken relationship.

492
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 My first friend needs a good Samaritan.

493
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 My friend who's in this marriage

494
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 needs a good Samaritan.

495
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 We need a good Samaritan.

496
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 And Jesus is that ultimate good Samaritan.

497
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 Let's read this passage together one more time together.

498
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
 Can you read for me?

499
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 One, two, three.

500
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 "But a Samaritan, as he traveled,

501
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 "came where the man was,

502
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 "and when he saw him, he took pity on him.

503
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 "He went to him and bandaged his wounds,

504
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 "pouring on oil and wine.

505
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 "Then he put the man on his own donkey,

506
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 "brought him into an inn,

507
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 "and took care of him.

508
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 "The next day, he took out two denarii

509
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 "and gave them to the innkeeper.

510
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 "'Look after him,' he said,

511
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 "'and when I return, I will reimburse you

512
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 "'any extra expense that you may have.'"

513
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 The first thing that this Samaritan person did

514
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 was he did what?

515
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 He came to where the man was,

516
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 and he saw him.

517
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 He saw him.

518
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 Many times, we're walking on the street

519
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 and there's a beggar, there's somebody really dirty,

520
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 and we don't even want to look at that person.

521
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 The priest and the Levite,

522
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 they didn't even want to look at this person,

523
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 whether he was alive or dead.

524
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 They didn't know.

525
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 They just wanted to go along the way.

526
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 But this Samaritan, good Samaritan,

527
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 looked upon that person.

528
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 There is acceptance.

529
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
 There is love.

530
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 There's sort of acknowledgement

531
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 that this is an actual person.

532
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 And in the same way,

533
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 as we are beaten, broken, robbed because of sin,

534
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 who looks at us?

535
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 Who looks at us?

536
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Jesus is looking at you.

537
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Jesus is looking at you.

538
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 In your state, in your brokenness,

539
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 He sees you.

540
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 He sees you and He's coming towards you.

541
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 Jesus is the good Samaritan,

542
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 accepting us, acknowledging our situation.

543
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 The next thing the Samaritan did

544
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 was He took pity on this person.

545
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And Jesus also knows our situation

546
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 and He has compassion upon us.

547
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Whatever we are going through,

548
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 the sin that we're struggling through,

549
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 Jesus understands.

550
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 He has compassion upon you.

551
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 He has compassion amongst us.

552
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 What's the next thing the good Samaritan did?

553
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 What did he do?

554
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 He bandaged up that person.

555
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 Jesus is a good Samaritan

556
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 that is also looking to heal us.

557
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 Sin has left us wounded

558
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 and Jesus has come, ultimately,

559
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 paid the ultimate price for us

560
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 to be healed of our wounds.

561
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
 He used oil.

562
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 He used oil and wine.

563
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 Oil signifying cleansing,

564
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 the coming of the Holy Spirit.

565
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 Oil, right?

566
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Anointing of the Holy Spirit.

567
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 Oil, healing oil.

568
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 The Holy Spirit also guides us,

569
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 heals us, leads us.

570
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Wine signifying cleansing.

571
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 The good Samaritan used wine

572
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 to cleanse the wounds.

573
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 The alcohol within it.

574
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Jesus comes with forgiveness.

575
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 The wine represents His blood

576
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 shed for us on the cross.

577
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 And there is forgiveness.

578
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 The wine represents the forgiveness of sins

579
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 and He paid two denarii.

580
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 Two denarii for the innkeeper.

581
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 Jesus leads us, ultimately,

582
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 to sanctuary,

583
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 to heaven,

584
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 to a better place,

585
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 a place where we one day

586
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 be fully healed.

587
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 And what did He say?

588
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 The good Samaritan, what did He say?

589
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 He will return.

590
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 He will return.

591
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 And Jesus also says He will return.

592
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 There is hope.

593
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Jesus will one day come back.

594
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 Jesus will fully heal us, restore us.

595
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 There is hope.

596
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 There is hope.

597
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 There's hope for my friend

598
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 who is going through all

599
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 these spiritual, physical, mental brokenness.

600
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 There is hope for my friend

601
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 who is in this marriage,

602
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 in this family, and doesn't know what to do.

603
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 There is hope.

604
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 There is healing.

605
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Jesus has not given up on them.

606
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Jesus is with them.

607
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
 Jesus sees their need.

608
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
 Jesus sees their moments of need,

609
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 their desperation, their brokenness.

610
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 And Jesus is there waiting for them,

611
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 wanting to heal them, forgive them,

612
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 give them the Holy Spirit,

613
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 and give them hope.

614
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 Do we need a Savior today?

615
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 Do you need a Savior today?

616
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 As the band comes up,

617
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 I just want us to have a moment

618
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 of reflection here.

619
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Jesus is the Good Samaritan,

620
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 the ultimate Samaritan,

621
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 Good Samaritan,

622
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 who has come to save us.

623
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 He knows your need.

624
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 He knows what you're going through.

625
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 Maybe tonight you come with a heavy heart.

626
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 You're dealing with issues.

627
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 You're dealing with problems in your life.

628
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
 Maybe there are some things that you've done

629
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 and you can't forgive yourself.

630
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 But Jesus sees you.

631
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Jesus is coming towards you,

632
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 and He wants to heal and forgive you.

633
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 Maybe you're coming with other issues,

634
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
 issues with family, with work,

635
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 whatever it might be,

636
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 Jesus understands,

637
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 and He wants to be your Savior.

638
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 He wants to be your Savior.

639
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,000
 Is there anybody here tonight

640
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 that is in need of a Savior?

641
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 Maybe you've come here for the first time

642
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 or the hundredth time,

643
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 and you haven't asked Jesus

644
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
 to be your Lord and Savior.

645
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 Would you be willing to surrender yourself,

646
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 surrender your brokenness,

647
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
 surrender your sin,

648
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 surrender your issues,

649
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 surrender your problems to Him tonight?

650
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 He is your Good Samaritan.

651
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 He comes with acceptance,

652
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 compassion, healing,

653
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,000
 forgiveness, and hope.

654
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Is there anybody here

655
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 that's in need of a Savior?

656
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 I'm going to say a prayer,

657
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 and I want all of us to pray this prayer,

658
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 to ask Jesus to be our Savior.

659
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 Repeat after me.

660
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 Dear Jesus,

661
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 I admit that I am broken.

662
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 I'm broken and robbed by sin.

663
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 I need a Savior.

664
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 I thank you that you are the Good Samaritan,

665
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 that you died on the cross for my sins,

666
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 and on the third day,

667
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 you rose again to prove

668
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
 that you are conquer, victorious, victorious

669
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 over sin and death.

670
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 I now invite you

671
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 to be my Lord and my Savior,

672
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 to give me healing and hope.

673
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
