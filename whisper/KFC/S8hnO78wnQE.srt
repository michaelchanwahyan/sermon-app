1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,240
 Hi Church and Happy New Year!

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:18,120
 I'm deeply sorry that you have to have another instalment from me on video.

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:25,840
 I was convinced that I needed to bring this word personally and was genuinely expecting

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,480
 to be back home in Hong Kong.

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,400
 But Sandra's dad's funeral is now not until next Tuesday and we hope to be flying back

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:45,480
 next Saturday and we will be back with you in person the week after.

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,800
 I can't wait.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,280
 Let me do a recap.

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:01:02,960
 On January 7th I set the scene, as it were, for our 2023 theme, Equipping the Saints,

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
 Serving the Community.

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:15,320
 And I talked about us to you to them.

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,960
 And I don't know about you but I was so blessed to hear both Dr Seth Kim and then our own

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:33,720
 Pastor Johnny talk powerfully about being firstly together and then about being prepared,

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:42,640
 opening the way for me to talk about being equipped today.

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:51,920
 Their sermons are the entry points, the admission tickets, as it were, for tonight's talk.

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,280
 I will be covering the passage, Ephesians 4, 11 to 16, that Bonnie so beautifully read

17
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,800
 for us earlier.

18
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:13,040
 This passage is our template for equipping.

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,480
 And it starts in verse 11 with God giving.

20
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
 This is important.

21
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,600
 We do well to remember this.

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,880
 It always starts with God giving.

23
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:39,360
 No apostle, prophet, evangelist or pastor teacher can say that it is anything of their

24
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,760
 own making.

25
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:55,260
 And the overall message here is that God gives so that the saints, that's you and me, may

26
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:08,920
 be equipped so that the body of Christ grows and is built up.

27
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,680
 What I plan to do this evening is a verse by verse teaching.

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,800
 I'll be taking these six verses in two halves.

29
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,280
 I'll call them part one and part two.

30
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:35,680
 You may remember that three weeks ago I said that Christ's plan A for the world is the

31
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,960
 church.

32
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,000
 He doesn't have a plan B.

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,800
 And for my first half, part one this evening, I want to look at the way that Christ has

34
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,640
 distributed his spiritual gifts to his people.

35
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:08,360
 I'll call them the how, the why and the where.

36
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,600
 I'll be looking at how, the means that God enables his people.

37
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,320
 Verse 11.

38
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,440
 The why, the purpose that God has for his people in verse 12.

39
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,080
 And the where, the goal that God has for his people.

40
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,000
 Let's look at them one at a time.

41
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,600
 Firstly how, the means that God enables his people.

42
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
 Let's read.

43
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:48,760
 And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers.

44
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:57,160
 The first thing that is mentioned is how God, through Christ, has made it possible for all

45
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:05,800
 of his people to receive the truth they need to live right and good lives.

46
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:15,480
 God gave certain gifts and associated them with certain key offices in the church.

47
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:23,040
 These men and ladies are not called leaders here, but certainly play their influential

48
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,240
 part.

49
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,400
 There are four categories, although some suggest five.

50
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,480
 Apostles, prophets, evangelists and pastor teachers.

51
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:49,120
 Christ equips these certain persons with gifts and positions to train, equip and protect

52
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,120
 the sheep.

53
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,160
 Let's first discuss what each of these gifts to the church might mean and then come back

54
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,040
 to how it relates to our own church.

55
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,120
 Firstly, the term apostle means sent one.

56
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,800
 We can best understand the apostle's special designation as a church starter, or in today's

57
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,080
 terms we call them a church planter.

58
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,060
 These individuals go into uncharted territories and establish the church of God.

59
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,280
 They define the basic truths of the gospel, who Christ is, how a person is saved and what

60
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,040
 the gospel is, and so on.

61
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:41,380
 The prophet takes what God has given to him and reveals it to God's people.

62
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,680
 God is communing with the people.

63
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,960
 This can be foretelling, but is generally forth telling, speaking the word of God for

64
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,800
 now to the people.

65
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,320
 In many people's minds, the evangelist is the person who speaks and charms thousands

66
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,700
 down to the front of the auditorium during an oracle.

67
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,440
 This disguises the real meaning of the evangelist.

68
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,220
 It again is not his charm or winsome personality, but the spirit of God working through the

69
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:31,560
 evangelist's message that releases the gospel into the hearts of men so the spirit of God

70
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,440
 can use it to convert the souls he is working in.

71
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,480
 Let's speak about Pastor Teacher, the ESV actually calls it Shepherd Teacher.

72
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,640
 It's generally regarded as one position, but we could equally have argued that it's two.

73
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:59,720
 Either way, we cannot dogmatically use our conclusions to define our ministries.

74
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,000
 A pastor cares for a local group of God's people, sometimes more.

75
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,080
 He or she has a narrow focus.

76
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,360
 The apostle may focus on a regent.

77
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,120
 The prophet focuses on the relevant target, whether it be a group or individual.

78
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,640
 And the evangelist, of course, focuses on the unreached.

79
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:32,080
 The pastor teacher sets his heart on training the people in his own congregation.

80
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,040
 The conclusion to verse 11 is that God will be calling and raising leaders from among

81
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,480
 our congregations to these positions.

82
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:50,640
 My question is, are you one of them?

83
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,520
 If we start opening our eyes in faith to the God who is serious about equipping the church,

84
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,920
 then he indeed will bless us.

85
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,040
 We must not succumb to the doubt that we don't need these gifted individuals.

86
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,120
 May God all the more equip us like the New Testament church.

87
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,080
 God is serious about training his people.

88
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:25,240
 We need to get with it and start recognising those he has gifted around us.

89
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,520
 Otherwise we will never get where God wants to take us.

90
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:38,600
 And that, dear church, is how, the means that God enables his people.

91
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:47,560
 We now need to understand why God gave such gifts to his church.

92
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:55,920
 He is very purposed in his provision of these instructors.

93
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,680
 Verse 12, this is why.

94
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:09,400
 To equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ.

95
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,680
 Now I spoke at length about this verse three weeks ago and do not intend repeating myself,

96
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:22,120
 but suffice to say this one small verse clearly maps out God's design for the church.

97
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,080
 He enables the church to reflect his love and truth in the world.

98
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:38,720
 It embodies everything that we at Gong Fook Church are looking to in 2023 and beyond.

99
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,760
 As we awaken to the glorious and most gracious calling for the church to serve him, we are

100
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:54,560
 all the more moved at the love and grace of God towards our own lives.

101
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,760
 For instead of growing in pride, we are humbled that God would work in our lives, yes even

102
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,400
 us, in such wonderful fashion.

103
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:12,800
 The world today is in desperate need for a church that is operating in the way that God

104
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:22,600
 envisaged when the church of Christ was born and the spirit lit the flame as we sang.

105
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:35,880
 For us, equipping the saints is not a catchphrase, but a necessity given the state of the worldwide

106
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,240
 church in 2023.

107
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,760
 I was reading a quote this week from famous explorer Bear Grylls.

108
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:55,120
 He said this, "I think Jesus would struggle with 99% of churches nowadays."

109
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,220
 Sad, eh?

110
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,680
 People are wondering if the church has any meaning.

111
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,720
 Many do not see God's love in the church.

112
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,200
 The church wonders if it has anything to offer and when the church is confused, it begins

113
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,600
 to act just like the world.

114
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:30,080
 This might be the way the church is in many cases, but it does not need to remain there.

115
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:39,440
 What equipping the saints, serving the community is about is when the people of God catch the

116
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:48,040
 truth and love of God as shown in his great plan for the people of God, she wakes up the

117
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:53,440
 call and the opportunity for God's church.

118
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,920
 And that is the why, the purpose that God has for his people.

119
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,800
 But let's look at where we are going, the goal that God has for his people.

120
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:19,920
 And it's in verse 13, "Until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge

121
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:28,800
 of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of

122
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,000
 Christ."

123
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,920
 This is getting exciting.

124
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,080
 We gain a much better understanding of how the whole picture looks here in Ephesians

125
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,560
 4.13.

126
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:47,440
 We find that Christ has a purpose in mind when he gives gifts to his church.

127
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:57,280
 In verse 11 we saw that God gives us preachers, apostles, pastor teachers, prophets.

128
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,560
 But if these instructors are not rightly living out their calling, then the church will be

129
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,400
 weak.

130
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:12,400
 If the pastor, for example, believes the church can grow because he is a good administrator

131
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:18,120
 or even a winsome preacher, then he will ultimately fail.

132
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:27,000
 It's true he might be able to grow, even grow a big congregation, but he will not have Christ's

133
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 fullness.

134
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,640
 When these equipers focus on what they feel is right and on their natural talent, they

135
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:39,360
 tend to ignore what God has appointed them to do.

136
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,320
 We must return to God's way of doing things.

137
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,280
 God has appointed to bring grace to the church through the right functioning of apostles,

138
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,960
 evangelists, prophets and pastor teachers.

139
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:02,520
 Our goal is not just to get people into church, but to teach them so that they themselves

140
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,560
 can serve the community.

141
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:17,600
 All of us need to know the word of God and how to use it to minister our own gifts.

142
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:27,320
 By growing the people, the numbers of people able to serve and minister, we begin together

143
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,120
 to overwhelm the forces of darkness.

144
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:38,520
 Satan would have a hard time holding back the word of God.

145
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:46,760
 This is why equipping, equipping is so important.

146
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:53,760
 The problem here is not that society is too dark and evil, but only there is not enough

147
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,400
 light.

148
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:06,360
 The church can awaken and be the instrument that God uses to change the community.

149
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,680
 All the church needs has been given.

150
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,280
 The problem is we just don't believe it.

151
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:19,400
 Many Christians have lost hope by the sad things that they have seen happen amongst

152
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,120
 the people of God.

153
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,640
 They think that such a grand picture of the church is for some sort of distant heaven.

154
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,440
 The apostle, however, does not give us this picture at all.

155
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,440
 Paul is talking about now.

156
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,240
 The time for transformation is now.

157
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,760
 We have totally missed it if we think it is for another day.

158
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,400
 In this case, our goal might just be to get by.

159
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
 To do church.

160
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:56,800
 Rather than, as it says here in verse 13, to grow.

161
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,320
 To grow in the fullness of Christ.

162
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,240
 Now we might be able to criticise the church for not doing this or not being that, but

163
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,080
 we need to come back to our own lives.

164
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:19,840
 We can ask ourselves, are we, are we, am I truly seeking these three things?

165
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,400
 In verse 13, for our own lives.

166
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,200
 Let's look at them one at a time.

167
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,720
 Firstly, Paul said to attain to the unity of the faith.

168
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:38,160
 If I am seeking the unity of the faith, then I myself will live by faith.

169
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,280
 As Dr Seth told us, I will love others because they are God's people.

170
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,840
 Even if I don't get along with them as well.

171
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:56,120
 I will seek God to teach me all the truth that I need to know that I can rightfully

172
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,920
 carry out my work of ministry.

173
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,480
 Faith is always unifying.

174
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,520
 Because it constantly calls us to go beyond our own way of treating others and to care

175
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,600
 for others as Christ would.

176
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,680
 And next Paul talked about attaining to the knowledge of the Son of God.

177
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:27,600
 If I am seeking the knowledge of the Son of God, then all other goals in my life will

178
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,140
 become by comparison unattractive.

179
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:43,240
 What once occupied my mind and heart is now gone because I have tasted the love of God.

180
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,960
 Nothing compares with Christ.

181
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,520
 We want more of Christ rather than less.

182
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,960
 Away with church politics, infighting, jealousies.

183
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,960
 We just want Christ.

184
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:07,040
 And lastly Paul said we attain to mature manhood to the measure of the stature of the fullness

185
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,840
 of Christ.

186
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:17,360
 If I am to be a mature man, and yes this of course includes you ladies, if I am to

187
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:24,320
 be a mature man through which Christ fully lives, I need to focus on my growth which

188
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:31,120
 fosters humility rather than my past experience which fosters pride.

189
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,480
 We want Christ to be known through our lives rather than us being known.

190
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,440
 We desire God's love to radiate to others through our lives.

191
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,440
 But the question I keep asking myself, why?

192
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,920
 Why doesn't the church look like this?

193
00:19:52,920 --> 00:20:01,320
 And we will see the answers for this in the next section, the second half on Ephesians

194
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,680
 14-16.

195
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,800
 Paul will be telling the church three things.

196
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,720
 Number one, don't be deceived.

197
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,440
 Secondly, speak the truth in love.

198
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,960
 And thirdly, grow up.

199
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,880
 Let's look at them one at a time.

200
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,640
 Firstly, don't be deceived.

201
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:34,720
 Ephesians 14, so that we may no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves and

202
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:42,600
 carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful

203
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,760
 schemes.

204
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,360
 You know, the biggest problem with the church is she doesn't think she is deceived.

205
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,840
 And if we don't know the problem, then we are most likely infected with the virus, yeah

206
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,440
 that word again, which results in our deception.

207
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,800
 I want to draw to your attention four serious flaws that have resulted in big problems for

208
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,440
 the church.

209
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:21,160
 Firstly, professionalism allows the notion that certain members should and do the majority

210
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,320
 of church work.

211
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,560
 I'll leave it to the pastors, after all, my tithes pay their salaries.

212
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:35,720
 Because of this, the people are not mobilised, and much of the work of the ministry is neglected.

213
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,280
 People do not expect to be trained because they do not see themselves as the workers.

214
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:48,680
 They tend to think they are better off when the worship service is short and entertaining

215
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,520
 rather than long and instructive.

216
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:59,760
 Their Christianity can be summarised by one church service that they attend each week.

217
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,000
 The second serious flaw is individualism.

218
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,080
 Individualism wrongly teaches that the expression of our own thoughts and ideas is most important

219
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,320
 to our life and fulfilment.

220
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:22,640
 These individuals will focus on meeting their own felt needs rather than the needs of others.

221
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,920
 This happens when a pastor seeks the approval of the congregation rather than the training

222
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,200
 of others.

223
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:37,080
 This also results when the congregation do works for the Lord in their own flesh.

224
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:43,840
 One observation I have is how little churches seem to pray these days.

225
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,800
 Carelessness reveals self-confidence rather than faith in the Lord.

226
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:56,320
 We need to build each other up so that we can do God's work together.

227
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,600
 The third serious flaw is what I would call religiosity.

228
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,280
 Religiosity teaches that a person can be a good Christian by attending this function or

229
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,720
 that function.

230
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:16,840
 Associated problems are the great number of people that see church attendance as the only

231
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,920
 thing expected from them.

232
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,240
 They are uncommitted.

233
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,360
 The fourth serious flaw is what I would call spirituality.

234
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:35,280
 Spirituality teaches that one's spiritual life consists in inward, otherworldly notions

235
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:44,160
 and feelings which breeds arrogance and despises rules, authority and interdependence.

236
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:52,560
 On the other hand, true spirituality causes a true desire to constantly grow to be more

237
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,880
 like Christ.

238
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,120
 It causes oneself to be closely involved in the growth of other Christians and it causes

239
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:06,800
 the balance of truth and love worked out in the relationship with others.

240
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:19,960
 It causes a commitment to learn and observe God's truth as taught in his word.

241
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:28,000
 The church has a lot of problems because Satan has duped her.

242
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,080
 She doesn't really know what is right.

243
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,960
 Without this persistent training that God provides us through the instructors he has

244
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,280
 given his church, Christians will stumble and fall.

245
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:48,960
 God has given us the key to growing strong godly people.

246
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:59,200
 We need to be aggressive in training them to equip the saints.

247
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,720
 Secondly he talks about speaking the truth in love.

248
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
 Verse 15.

249
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,200
 "Rather speaking the truth in love."

250
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,720
 Let me ask you a question.

251
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,600
 Is the truth more important than love?

252
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:21,040
 Or is the love more important than truth?

253
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,920
 If you can answer yes to either question, then you are off balance.

254
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,960
 Truth is love and love is truth.

255
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
 Drop one and you lose both.

256
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,500
 Gain one and the other will come.

257
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:44,280
 We must not compromise on what the apostle says is important for the church to carry

258
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,120
 out her mission.

259
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,440
 We need to speak the truth in love.

260
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,520
 Our goal and means are clearly laid out here.

261
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,600
 The goal is to become more like Christ our head.

262
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,800
 The means is simply to lovingly proclaim and live out the truth.

263
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:12,280
 Both of these elements, truth and love, are not to be compromised in any way.

264
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,480
 They are both essential to the glory of Christ.

265
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:25,360
 John 1.14 tells us, "And the word," that's Jesus, "became flesh and dwelt among us, and

266
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,520
 we have seen his glory.

267
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:38,080
 Glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth."

268
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,480
 What I found is the church often swings from one extreme to the other.

269
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,200
 The needed balance was beautifully worked out in Christ.

270
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,240
 The challenge for us is to live it out.

271
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,020
 We must speak the truth in love.

272
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,080
 We speak the uncomfortable truth because people need to hear it.

273
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,360
 We speak lovingly because it is the only way to speak the truth.

274
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:14,240
 Otherwise, we misrepresent the truth.

275
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:22,200
 Churches need to instruct their people on how to both speak the truth in love as well

276
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,300
 as how to make Christ the goal in life.

277
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:34,480
 We must refuse to compromise the truth in the name of love.

278
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,520
 Paul's last call is simple.

279
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,080
 It is two words.

280
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,960
 Grow up.

281
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,720
 We are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ.

282
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:53,600
 Note the fact we are to grow up in all aspects.

283
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,400
 To be honest, it will take a lifetime, but why stop?

284
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,240
 Let us reflect on growth by examining a number of questions.

285
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,540
 Firstly, how come some Christians don't think they need to grow?

286
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:14,840
 The biggest problem of the church is that she does not think she needs to grow.

287
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,480
 Once a person knows he or she is a Christian and guaranteed a seat in heaven, they lose

288
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,820
 interest in the things of God.

289
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:28,280
 This is largely because the church has not done a good job of training, of equipping

290
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,040
 the church.

291
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,480
 Very few churches implement discipleship.

292
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:43,040
 Christians think they know what they need, when in fact all they know is the means by

293
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,840
 which they can learn more.

294
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,520
 How are Christians to grow?

295
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,400
 God has revealed the whole growth process in Ephesians 4.

296
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:03,280
 The church can only grow if she rightly receives the word of God, the Bible.

297
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:10,800
 Each of the main conduits through which the truth enters the church is an instructor of

298
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,720
 truth.

299
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,680
 Growth is inextricably related to acquiring a love for the truth.

300
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,200
 We learn the truth and obey it.

301
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,280
 Growth then means a person is more like Christ in his attitudes, his treatment of others,

302
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,920
 and his belief in God.

303
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,240
 And lastly, how are we to measure our growth?

304
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,680
 Many Christians live aimlessly in this world.

305
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,760
 They have no goals, no instruction, no motivation.

306
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,280
 A Christian that is growing will find sweeter and sweeter times with the Lord.

307
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:55,080
 Better relationships with others and a feeling of deeper personal fulfilment.

308
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:02,240
 This does not mean things will go easy for him or her, but only that they have the peace

309
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:09,080
 of heart about the Lord taking care of his situation.

310
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,240
 So our solution is simple enough.

311
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,120
 Number one, do not be deceived by the world.

312
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,800
 Number two, speak the truth in love.

313
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,960
 And number three, keep growing like Christ.

314
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,920
 But I'm not done yet.

315
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,760
 I won't be long.

316
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,960
 The apostle has given us a special illustration that ties everything together.

317
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,320
 And it is verse 16.

318
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,480
 Now let's read it together.

319
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,760
 I know I'm in the UK and you're in Hong Kong, but we can read it together.

320
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:55,560
 1 2 3 From whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it

321
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:03,160
 is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself

322
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,280
 up in love.

323
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:12,400
 From this verse we can see how the body should rightly grow.

324
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,720
 I'm going to make some observations.

325
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,840
 I want to take it phrase by phrase.

326
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,480
 Firstly, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which

327
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,680
 it is equipped.

328
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,180
 Each person is part of the whole, part of the whole body.

329
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:37,200
 Each person has his own key role to play in the overall development of the whole body.

330
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,520
 No part is to be neglected.

331
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:47,040
 Each is valuable and important to reaching the final goal that God has for us.

332
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,280
 We cannot say or assume that one part is not important.

333
00:31:52,280 --> 00:32:02,520
 Each part has a place and each part is interdependent, it is held together.

334
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:09,020
 Paul then goes on to say when each part is working properly, we must be diligent to make

335
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,960
 each part properly function.

336
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,560
 A part might be in the right place, but if it is not functional, it still can't rightly

337
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,620
 help others.

338
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:28,520
 We all need to be diligent in not just having people come to church, but they are effectively

339
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,940
 trained, equipped, so that they can rightfully serve.

340
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,400
 No training means no proper working.

341
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,900
 Lets move on.

342
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,480
 Makes the body grow so that it builds itself up.

343
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,640
 When the individual body parts are rightfully functioning, then the whole body grows.

344
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:59,960
 We are on the whole far too individualistic.

345
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,600
 We think about our own growth, rather than the whole body's growth.

346
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:11,880
 Have you ever prayed, "Lord help me grow so that everyone will be benefited"?

347
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,060
 Probably not.

348
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:19,240
 And lastly, these two words, in love.

349
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,360
 Growth is inextricably linked, related to love.

350
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,080
 Love is the definitive summary of growth.

351
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,800
 Love captures everything that is supposed to happen.

352
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,080
 Love is the life of God being poured into our lives.

353
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,320
 Love is the connecting glue that keeps us together.

354
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:47,280
 Love brings about smooth interfunctioning, much like oil.

355
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:56,280
 Love is the joy and desire to continuing functioning together in the future.

356
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:04,200
 Love has to be the motivation for us to equip the saints.

357
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:14,360
 Love also has to be the motivation for us to serve the community.

358
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,360
 Can I hear Amen?

359
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
 Amen.

360
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:29,600
 I am so excited that next week, Pastor John is going to be giving us a how-to, on equipping

361
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,320
 and how to share the gospel with others.

362
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,960
 And the week after, Pastor James is going to give us a how-to, a how to present the

363
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,280
 Word of God.

364
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,760
 I would love to pray for us now.

365
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,200
 And if I could just pray as the band comes up.

366
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:58,520
 Father, I thank you for your provision for us, for all that you've provided for us as

367
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,960
 a church.

368
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,640
 I pray now that you'd fill us once again with your Holy Spirit.

369
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:11,160
 In particular, Lord, that you'd allow us to speak the truth in love.

370
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:18,760
 Lord, I pray your love would shower upon us as a congregation, so that we would take your

371
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:26,040
 love out to a world and a community that needs it so desperately.

372
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,040
 We pray this in Jesus' name.

373
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,620
 Amen.

374
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,440
 Thank you guys and I'll see you in two weeks.
