[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   Today I'm with my family, beautiful wife Christine, daughter Abigail, and Tomiko, my son.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.160]   Our last daughter is home.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.560]   She's not doing coronation.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.700]   I hope she does.
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.840]   She's doing homework.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.560]   So yeah, thank you very much.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.400]   I just want to talk a little bit about myself.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.720]   Originally we are from Zambia, and we are Zambians.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.520]   He wanted me to revise the geography.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.880]   Zambia is in the sub-Saharan Africa, specifically on the southern part.
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.880]   Got independent in 1964 from the British, and now we are on our own.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.920]   So that's where I was born, and in a village called Lundazi.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.600]   So my parents relocated to a city, Lusaka, and we grew up there.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.720]   From a family of eight, I had elder brothers and sisters.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.200]   I am the seventh one, and yeah, almost at the end, so I have a younger sister.
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.800]   So today I want to just talk about my life in Zambia briefly.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:30.360]   So in 1990, or the 1990s, what happened was that the nation suffered a crisis, financial
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.320]   crisis.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.800]   And this was under the dictate of the IMF, because they had to tell the government to
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.920]   restructure, to change things here and there.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.600]   So what that entailed was that many people had to lose their jobs.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.640]   You know what it means when the companies are restructuring, okay, if you want us to
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.600]   help you, if you want us to look into this debt accordingly, you need to trim down.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.120]   You need to lay off some people.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.960]   And this affected a lot of households.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.840]   It affected a lot of families.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:17.520]   Listen, ladies and gentlemen, as though that were not enough, it was the HIV and AIDS situation
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:26.120]   had just hit, and it was at its peak, it was escalating in the 1990s.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.800]   And that meant some of the family heads, instead of going for work, they had to remain behind
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.080]   because they are sick, or every day they are at a hospital.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.880]   And because of that, they were laid off.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.520]   So that means a lot of people lost school places.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.080]   I mean, the children weren't able to go to school, because that time, the government
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.440]   had not introduced free education.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.440]   You had to pay.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.920]   There was a fee.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.760]   And a lot of children dropped off school.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.480]   So this is what happened.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.560]   Together with a group of people from a church that we were attending, we said, "We are going
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.520]   to educate these kids.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.600]   We are going to start a school for them.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.200]   We want to make sure that they're able to read.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.920]   They are missing out."
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.440]   This led me to resign from a job.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:35.120]   I was working as a salesperson, as if you want, a petrol attendant at a gas station.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.320]   And from that gas station, I survived two killings.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.320]   I mean, I was at gunpoint.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.360]   We're working in the night, and this guy just drives in and says, "Hey, can you fill my
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.480]   tank?"
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.520]   I go to the door to receive the money.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.080]   He says, "Hey, out of here."
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.080]   First time.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.400]   Second time, we were just resting at the backyard.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.720]   Somebody comes and says, "Hey, give us all the money.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.720]   Give us all the money."
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.720]   We had to do that.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.840]   Guess what?
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.600]   I was saved from that.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.640]   I believe that it was for a reason.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.600]   I believe that God had something in store for me.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.560]   He saved my life.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.480]   And I left that job, not because of those guns, not because of that threat, but because
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.120]   we saw the kids that were unable to go to school.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.640]   We went around the neighborhood.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.320]   We went around the community, and we said, "Hey, come to this school.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.760]   We are going to start a school at Jesus Army Church.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760]   Come, come, come, come."
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.200]   And we started a school in a makeshift kind of arrangement in terms of infrastructure,
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.840]   in terms of building.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.800]   And there were 50 children that appeared on the very first day.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.160]   So long story short, these children were written off.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.460]   These children were unable to read.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.680]   By the way, it's either a child has dropped out of school because of money, like I'm saying,
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.840]   or just a silly thing like without shoes.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.100]   And we were like, "Come to school without shoes as long as you want to learn."
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:18.740]   So we gave them an opportunity to learn.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.460]   In the first three years of operation, this is what we did.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.900]   It was free, and all the teachers were voluntary.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.700]   I was one of the teachers, as a matter of fact, leading these teachers on a voluntary
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.700]   basis.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.180]   How do you survive?
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.180]   By faith.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.380]   The Bible says, "Rashas, live by faith."
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.140]   And we were doing other things to make ends meet, but it was difficult.
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.940]   But we had to go on.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.580]   We had to go on, and we continued because we had these children at heart.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.580]   Later, we started collecting fees.
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.220]   These fees, ladies and gentlemen, will lead to nothing.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.460]   So when we collect the money, we used to put it together, buy supplies.
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.060]   The remainder, we would share amongst ourselves.
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.620]   Maybe at times, I would be the last person to receive that.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:21.620]   Just give other people.
[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.740]   Just give other people.
[00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.440]   I don't know why that was happening, but we continued.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.340]   We hung on in there.
[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.500]   We hung in there.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.220]   And the Lord is faithful, and he came through, and he helped us.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.220]   So there was no money.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.420]   The little that we got, we didn't call it a salary even.
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.620]   It was just an allowance.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.780]   That if you are on school break, there is no allowance.
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.780]   There is nothing.
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.100]   But with a joy, we continued.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.820]   And this is what was happening.
[00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.240]   We were not just looking at life in the classroom or in the school.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.460]   We had life beyond.
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.940]   This is how come sometimes I would receive a knock.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.900]   We didn't have no cell phones.
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.900]   Yes?
[00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.420]   We didn't have -- only a few people that had cell phones.
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.820]   The privilege at that time in the '90s.
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:27.380]   And knock at our door in the night, in the middle of the night, and somebody says, "I
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.540]   have no food."
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.020]   And this is apparent to the child who comes to school.
[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:38.340]   We only know them by virtue of the child coming to our school.
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.340]   And they think, "Well, I can find help there."
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:42.420]   But there is no help.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.380]   So what do you do?
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:55.200]   You sacrifice the little that you have and give it to the people that come.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:01.420]   So in Zambia, we also started a church.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:08.340]   And the church that we started was actually full of the kids that we were serving.
[00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:13.100]   Because most of them didn't know the law.
[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.700]   They didn't have the relationship with God.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.460]   They didn't have.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.820]   And we started a church.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.280]   The church was already there, but we planted another one.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.860]   Most of them came to that church.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.100]   And their parents.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:35.180]   So we passed that church up to 2012, from 2005.
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.120]   I had to leave Zambia.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.540]   I was leaving the school from 1998.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.140]   That's when it started.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:48.780]   And then in 2012, I left the school to come and work in Hong Kong.
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.460]   I joined Crossroads Foundation.
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:57.740]   And in Crossroads Foundation, one thing that...
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.980]   I wasn't feeling good whenever I see a wheelchair.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.860]   I avoided touching a wheelchair.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:10.620]   Because when I was leaving Zambia, my father was bound to a wheelchair.
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.620]   And he blessed me.
[00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.300]   And he said, "Go well, my son.
[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:20.660]   If I had strength, I was going to jump up off this wheelchair to take you to the airport."
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.660]   And you know what?
[00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.780]   A father's blessing is important.
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.620]   And he says, "God bless you.
[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.140]   Go well."
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.580]   And with that, I had to come to Hong Kong in joy.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.260]   But whenever I see a wheelchair, I would...
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.220]   I remember my father.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.980]   But listen to me.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.860]   You need to be obedient.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.860]   I said, "Okay, I'm going to clean this wheelchair.
[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.860]   I'm going to prepare it.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.740]   And I will put it on the container that is going to go to Moldova.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:52.720]   That is going to go to the Philippines.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.820]   The container that is going to go to an African country.
[00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.220]   For I know how it is going to help."
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.460]   Listen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.460]   I've been on either side.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.700]   One side where we receive a container.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.820]   And on the other side where we pack a container.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:13.720]   And when you pack that container, you know the impact that it is going to have.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.860]   You know the impact.
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.100]   You know the lives.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.900]   You know how many children are going to be touched because of the container that you're
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.900]   packing.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.020]   As a result, you go for it.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.020]   You serve.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.220]   I love wheelchairs, man.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.740]   From that time, the trauma that I had was like, "Okay, fine.
[00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:38.100]   It is important that I pass through this thing so that I can understand what other people
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.540]   need."
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.860]   How it helped my father.
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:48.580]   I know that I want to step into the shoe of another man that needs a wheelchair.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.300]   For this matter, I'm going to clean it.
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.100]   And when I send it out of Hong Kong, I want it received with dignity.
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.140]   And I continued serving in Crossroads.
[00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:04.780]   I continued.
[00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:08.140]   I used to go in homes.
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.300]   Sometimes people come to my office and say, "We want a bank bed."
[00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.060]   But they don't know how to assemble it.
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.380]   I just go an extra mile.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.260]   I go home later and my wife says, "Hey, where were you?"
[00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.740]   I said, "Honey, there was this lady.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.500]   She has three children.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.740]   And they're living in this house.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.260]   And they don't even know how to assemble a bank bed."
[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:38.380]   Listen, when you give somebody a piece of furniture, your job should end there.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:45.500]   But if you listen to the inner voice, you cannot stay.
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.500]   You want to go an extra mile.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:53.500]   Okay, so I just want to tell you something about the refugees.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.820]   And I'll share a few stories.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.020]   And then we'll go on and look at a few verses.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:05.860]   Two weeks ago, Dr. Susanna was able to give us a demographic situation in terms of life
[00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.940]   in Hong Kong.
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:13.380]   She did emphasize how there is this gap between the poor and the rich, how that it is widening.
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.580]   I want to believe that this is world over, right?
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.580]   These things are happening world over, not just in Hong Kong, but specifically to Hong
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.580]   Kong.
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.580]   She gave us these demographics.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:27.220]   And I want to add to it that among those people that she was describing are refugees.
[00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.140]   Trust me, refugees are even worse.
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.380]   They're even worse.
[00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:42.540]   You heard how Pastor John just introduced that scenario of refugees not being allowed
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:51.060]   to work, of refugees being not allowed even to line up for whatever medical condition
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.300]   that is, you know, procedure.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:57.060]   Just to line up, they don't even have a right.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:09.660]   I want to emphasize today that what Dr. Susanna was saying includes the refugees.
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:16.500]   Let me take this opportunity to thank KFCI for having supported Branches of Hope.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.300]   I know you have supported Branches of Hope.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.980]   And thank you so much.
[00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.980]   God bless you.
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.260]   God bless the work of your hand.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:32.020]   So let me just tell you a few stories about these refugees that I have an opportunity
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.420]   to talk with.
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:41.700]   On March 6, there was ... Do you want to go back to that?
[00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.260]   Go back to that, okay.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.860]   Yeah, just to start.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.660]   Come back to that later.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:52.780]   March 6, this woman called Kay.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:58.340]   She walks into the office and she comes to my desk and says, "Mr. Green," at least that's
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:01.060]   what they call me, they call me Mr. Green.
[00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:05.380]   She's like, "Mr. Green, I would like to have some baby clothes.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:12.500]   I would like to have some baby diapers, baby wet wipes, and so on and so forth."
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.780]   And she just gave me a wish list.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:21.340]   And I made an appointment for her to go and pick up, because as Branches of Hope, we work
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.620]   with other organizations that we can collaborate with.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.800]   For instance, those people that are going to do legal services, we don't have the capacity.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:35.260]   We have very little capacity in terms of in-kind donation, and we refer them.
[00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.220]   And the first place we refer them to was Crossroads.
[00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.020]   And the appointment is fixed.
[00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:46.260]   Listen to me, ladies and gentlemen, she calls me and she says, "Hey, Mr. Green, can we change
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.140]   this appointment to at least April?"
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.340]   I said, "Okay."
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.580]   And then it was changed.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:59.780]   She calls me again and say, "Can we change this appointment up to May?"
[00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.180]   What is it with the changing of appointments?
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.180]   Is there a problem?
[00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.060]   And she says, "Yes, Mr. Green.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:09.580]   My baby is in the hospital."
[00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:11.980]   I said, "When did she go there?"
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.540]   She said, "She was born six months ago.
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.780]   In fact, four months ago."
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.900]   That's what she told me.
[00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.420]   And she has never been home.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.420]   This baby has never been home.
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.220]   This is how come I'm postponing.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.420]   This is how come I'm just deferring.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:38.980]   Because I don't have anywhere to put these things when I receive them, because I'm sharing
[00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.740]   with my two friends.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.300]   I'm in a shared space.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.300]   This is where I live.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.260]   And my baby cannot come to that space.
[00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:55.500]   When I get my baby out of the hospital, I'm going to start living with the father in Kuta."
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.860]   I said, "Oh, so are you separated?"
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:06.380]   And then she says, "Actually, I'm only hoping that the baby's father would take her on,
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.900]   because she's already married to another woman.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.460]   Not only are we separated, but she's married to another woman."
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:16.420]   I said, "Oh, really?"
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.820]   Then I called her again.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:28.860]   This time around, it was actually on 5th April.
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.860]   I called her.
[00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.100]   I said, "Hey, Kay.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.100]   How are you doing?
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.540]   How is your baby this time?"
[00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.460]   She prefers to do an audio.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.900]   She said, "Mr. Green, my baby is still sick.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.220]   My baby is now on oxygen.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.380]   I am afraid.
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.220]   I don't know what is going to happen."
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.340]   I said, "Does the father visit?"
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.340]   "No.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.740]   Only my two friends.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.060]   No other person visits me."
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.700]   And she's on oxygen.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.500]   I'm afraid, Mr. Green.
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.140]   You know what?
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:13.860]   When you hear such kind of a thing, you're moved by compassion.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.860]   You're moved.
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.980]   You remember what Pastor John was telling us about compassion, that the Greek word for
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:25.460]   compassion is splas nizomai.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.060]   It's not just an ordinary thing.
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:35.860]   It's something that you feel inside of you, in the deeper ends of your body, your bowels.
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.140]   They move.
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.820]   And when that thing happens to you, you cannot just stand still.
[00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:46.260]   When this thing happens to you, ladies and gentlemen, you want to do something.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:52.220]   If this thing happens to you, if something begins to move here, I wonder whether you're
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.220]   going to sit and fold your hands.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.260]   I was like, "Oh, I don't have money.
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.340]   I'm not a medical doctor.
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.700]   What am I going to do?
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.100]   I know I have something in me."
[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.820]   Of course, I was not telling her that.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.940]   Then to me, ladies and gentlemen, I said, "Can I pray for her?"
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.820]   I just said, "Yes, Mr. Green."
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:11.820]   I prayed.
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:19.060]   I'm like, "Father God, in the name of Jesus, this baby has been sick, has been in this
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.620]   hospital and the mother has been waiting.
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.740]   You know how long she's been waiting?
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:26.740]   Please Lord, heal her."
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.300]   I am praying, I'm praying.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:34.020]   The lady starts to sob afterwards and she's like, "Thank you.
[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.300]   Thank you, Mr. Green.
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.100]   By the way, she's a Muslim.
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.740]   I pray that the Lord is going to touch her one day.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:49.380]   I pray that the Lord is going to come through for her and that she is going to turn to him."
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:55.980]   Listen, then I called her again.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:00.820]   This was just on 4th May, before yesterday.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.620]   I said, "Hey, how is the baby?"
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:09.780]   She said, "Mr. Green, the baby is fine, but she had COVID.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.660]   She had COVID from the hospital.
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.220]   You know, she stayed in the hospital for two weeks.
[00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.220]   By the way, it's Queen Mary.
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.820]   We're not discrediting the hospital.
[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:17.060]   They did all they could.
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.980]   The baby was, you know, yeah, but we thank God because I mean, it's something that is
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:22.980]   inevitable.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.500]   You know, when you're confined like that.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:36.020]   So, she said, "The baby is fine, but the doctor says after recovering from COVID, soon
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.500]   she's going to come home.
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:41.100]   However, they gave me a condition.
[00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.980]   You cannot take this baby to a shared space.
[00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.260]   You need to find your own space."
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.860]   Now, how is she going to make it?
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:57.260]   I know that the government through the social warfare, they provide housing, you know, allowance
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.540]   and everything, and it's just little.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.780]   You and me know, it's very little.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.580]   It's meager, very little.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.300]   But she said, "Now, I have problems.
[00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.500]   I don't know what to do.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.500]   The father won't accept this baby because we're divorced."
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:21.260]   This baby is so beautiful.
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:29.660]   Her name is F. Fiaza.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.660]   Look at that baby.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.660]   So beautiful.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:44.220]   This baby needs your prayer.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.940]   I want to tell you another family.
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.660]   I called them Mother Anne and her two sons.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:58.860]   I was careful not to write M-O-M-N, like Mom Anne.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.220]   I want it to be English.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.180]   So, Mother Anne and her two sons.
[00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:10.380]   One son is six years and the other one is eight years.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:16.020]   As a matter of fact, Pastor John, if you remember, I talked about a boy called Siam.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:19.940]   This is the same family.
[00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.820]   It seems I'm just connected to them.
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.540]   Not intentionally.
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.940]   It just happens.
[00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.860]   This is on the 13th of April.
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.860]   By the way, before I go there, I am walking.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.060]   I'm going to work, Branches of Hope.
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.260]   We are at a traffic light.
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.260]   We're waiting to cross.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.420]   As we cross, I realize a boy is on the phone.
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.420]   I got concerned.
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:46.420]   I said, "Hey, what's happening?
[00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:50.380]   Let me see who this boy is and who the mother is."
[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:54.460]   It so happens that it was the boy that I know, Siam.
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.820]   This boy, this time around, he's in the company of his sibling.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:59.820]   The three.
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.820]   I'm like, "Oh, hello, hello, hello, hello."
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:03.820]   Then we're going.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:09.380]   They were going to Branches of Hope for the program that I run together with my colleagues.
[00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.180]   Then I said, "How come today you're coming with two children?
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.900]   How come there are three of you?"
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:18.260]   He said, "You know what, Mr. Green?
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.660]   Because there's no one at home to remain with the other child.
[00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:31.780]   Because only last night, only last night, we escorted, we took the father to the airport."
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.140]   Because immigration was like, "Come right now.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.620]   Pack your bags right now."
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.620]   I don't know about you.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.420]   Some of you might know about the removal policy.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.420]   Things have changed.
[00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:50.220]   If your claim is not accepted, there and then, there's not going to be any appeal.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.880]   You don't know when you're going to go.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.940]   We're living in fear.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.260]   We've just been hearing these things.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:56.940]   I have seen this firsthand.
[00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:02.380]   One family that I'm dealing with, separated, just like that.
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:10.300]   And then on the 13th of ... A few, I think one week later, this thing happened.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:16.940]   The children are playing, and the two children are playing, and they smash a window.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.100]   The child had 10 stitches.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:26.460]   At 9 p.m., they call an ambulance, and the child was in hospital for two days.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:32.620]   And there's no one to take the other child, the older one, to school.
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:38.780]   Because the mother has to attend to the one that is in the hospital.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:47.580]   If she goes to school, I mean, if she takes the boy to school, that means she's not going
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.460]   to visit the hospital, as it were.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.340]   There's another schedule in Hong Kong where schools are concerned.
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:59.940]   And so, he has to tag along to go to the hospital when the mother is going to nurse.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:09.420]   Ladies and gentlemen, when I look at this, she said, "Oh, Mr. Green, I'm so scared, because
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:15.620]   the landlord is going to ask me to repair, and I don't have no money.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:21.860]   And I haven't even told the landlord about what happened, because she's going to say,
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.580]   'Pay right away, repair it.'"
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:28.740]   What am I going to do?
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:35.580]   Branches of Hope has got no budget for such things sometimes.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.260]   I go online, and I search.
[00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:42.100]   I find an organization called Build and Wish.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.100]   And I call them.
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.180]   I said, "I have this problem."
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.060]   And they said, "Okay, where is it?"
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.060]   I said, "It's in Jordan."
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:54.020]   And then they said, "Okay, I'm going to send you a form to fill.
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.020]   Sorry, it's in Chinese.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.940]   You need somebody to help you translate it."
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.500]   And then he said, "Oh, by the way, you need to pay us $300.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.500]   We're not rich people.
[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.140]   There are people that go around Hong Kong.
[00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.140]   Maybe you know them.
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:14.020]   The people go around Hong Kong that renovate poor people's property or living space.
[00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.900]   Poor people don't own property, but they're renting.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.180]   So they renovate for them."
[00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:22.140]   And I reached out to these guys, and they said, "Yes, we're going to do it, but you
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.540]   need to give us $300."
[00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:30.500]   They said, "It's administrative or appreciation fees or something like that."
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.780]   Look, when people are struggling like that, my heart breaks.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.060]   You see how the window is broken there?
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.180]   I don't know what breaks yours.
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.100]   I don't know what breaks your heart.
[00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:49.540]   But such situations are the situations that break my heart to pieces.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.940]   And God helps to bring those pieces together.
[00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:56.540]   God helps to bring those pieces together, and he helps.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:01.460]   I want you to know that these are some of the people that we serve.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:08.620]   So I'm just praying that help is going to come for this woman.
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:12.140]   She's now alone with the children.
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:20.700]   Very quickly, the next one is Mother A and Son.
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.300]   Mother A and Son T. They need glasses.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:30.740]   Every time a child goes for an assessment, and they just give them a prescription, and
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:34.100]   they say it's very expensive.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.140]   And the mother, the same.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:44.220]   Ladies and gentlemen, only yesterday I had the privilege to go into the living space.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.820]   Forget about the glasses, forget about the prescription.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:54.420]   But one thing that really broke my heart, I was just telling my family last night, I
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:55.420]   was late.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.420]   I'm late.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:03.500]   I'm leaving the office late, and this woman just comes and says, "Mr. Greeney, come.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.380]   Mr. Greeney, come.
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.020]   I don't know how to measure.
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.420]   I want to..."
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:15.180]   She's receiving a wardrobe from Crossroads, but she says, "I want to measure because I
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.300]   don't know how to measure."
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.300]   She's uneducated with all due respect.
[00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.700]   She can't use a tape measure.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.380]   I said, "Look, I am late.
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.620]   I'm running late."
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:27.620]   What do you do in such cases?
[00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.500]   You just go, and I went.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.300]   I was holding my tears back, not because of what she told me.
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:39.300]   When we entered the house, I thought we were still going to the house.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.620]   We are yet to enter the house.
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.260]   But she says, "We're here."
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:48.380]   She says, "Sorry, Mr. Green, our house is small."
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:52.860]   Tea, the son was like, "Mr. Green, how do you like my place?"
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.580]   Everything is just in one place.
[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.380]   She says, "I don't like it."
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.660]   I said, "You know what, Tea?
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:01.260]   Other people do not have a roof over their head.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.260]   They sleep on the street.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.660]   You've got to be thankful."
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:13.860]   But listen to me, I was holding my tears back because the space is like this.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:14.860]   A small cube.
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:15.860]   Okay, a small cube.
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:20.740]   I'm like, "Where is she going to put the wardrobe?"
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.540]   So I measured and I sent it across.
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:29.420]   This morning I was saying, "These are the dimensions for two centimeters, 199 high and
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:34.700]   45 centimeters wide, deep 42 centimeters.
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:39.500]   These are the people that we serve.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.180]   These are the people that are in Hong Kong.
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:50.580]   Yes, they're refugees in Hong Kong and the instructions are very hard.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.580]   Why we serve?
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.580]   Why do we serve?
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:58.820]   I just want to share a few biblical reasons, three as a matter of fact.
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:00.300]   Why we serve?
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:04.500]   So I want to say serving is an act of submission.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:11.500]   You cannot serve if you do not submit yourself to the Lordship of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.500]   You cannot serve.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:22.820]   Now, even if you are already a Christian and if you have a prompt to serve and you're not
[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:27.180]   submissive, it's difficult to serve.
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:34.940]   If you're going to serve for the sake of it, you're going to grow weary.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.500]   You're going to grow tired.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.700]   You're going to seek people's praise.
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.700]   I don't care who is looking at me.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.380]   I don't care who is clapping or not.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:51.340]   I have to serve because I have to submit.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:58.740]   Let's read a couple of scriptures here.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:04.020]   Serving is an act of submission.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.780]   Before we read the one on the screen, this one is not on the screen, it's 1 Peter 3,
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.780]   verse 8.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:19.180]   Finally, all of you be like-minded, be sympathetic, love one another, be compassionate and humble.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.420]   We're not reading that one.
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:27.820]   Pastor John has alluded to it and it's been going and it's up on the screen there.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:36.460]   But I wanted to say we need to submit ourselves to Christ and we need to humble ourselves.
[00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:42.860]   When we humble ourselves, we are taking the Christ-like trait.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.980]   We become more like Jesus.
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:47.500]   We become more like him.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:55.700]   I'm here to encourage you to say when you submit, you're going to put others first.
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:31:00.700]   When you submit, you're not going to put your interests in front of others.
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.420]   It is going to be others than you.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.940]   Like Jesus is our perfect example.
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.860]   He submitted himself.
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.460]   He humbled himself up to the cross.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.900]   Death, even death on a cross.
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:22.500]   I want to encourage you, ladies and gentlemen, that when you take that attitude, when you
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:27.180]   take that attitude, you are going to begin shifting.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:32.580]   I want to believe that there are so many times that we have been called to volunteer and
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.260]   only a few people come to volunteer.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.260]   That's fine.
[00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:42.580]   I want you to realize that when you're humble enough, automatically you are going to shift
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.180]   from being served to serving others.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:52.580]   Automatically you are going to shift from a situation of being first, but then you're
[00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.740]   going to let others go before.
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:00.460]   Ladies and gentlemen, I want to encourage you that what we need is a paradigm shift
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:06.380]   in the model of being served, from the model of being served to the model of serving others.
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:08.020]   I want to encourage you.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.980]   You have to learn to be humble.
[00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.380]   I have to learn to be humble.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:18.900]   After that, I will serve.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.900]   This is submission.
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:32.460]   Listen, ladies and gentlemen, submission is not compliance.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.940]   Some people just submit for the sake of.
[00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:36.940]   You're only complying.
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.740]   You're not obeying.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:42.100]   Jesus Christ obeyed.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.660]   He obeyed.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:50.300]   Ladies and gentlemen, I pray that there's going to be a shift in your life.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.540]   I pray there's going to be a shift in your life.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.420]   I pray there's going to be a shift in my life.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:00.860]   That shift from me first to others first.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:05.820]   That shift from I don't know what to do.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:21.900]   That shift from being asked, "Can I do something?" to, "Can I do something for you?"
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:28.140]   The other point I want to share is serving speaks.
[00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:29.140]   Serving speaks.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:41.420]   You serve, you're actually sending a message about the love of God, about salvation.
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:49.740]   Of course, I want to emphasize that serving people does not save people.
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:55.740]   But in a way, they might just come to you and say, "Oh, you're a Christian."
[00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.660]   No wonder.
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:04.340]   People come and say, "Hey, how do you survive without a salary in Crossroads?"
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.700]   And then they come and say, "You're a Christian."
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.660]   I say, "Yes, I'm a Christian."
[00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.740]   You don't need to blow a trumpet.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:15.980]   I am a Christian.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.700]   No, they see what you do.
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.820]   Your action will speak.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.700]   Your serving will speak.
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:29.540]   I have a lot of people coming to me and say, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.540]   I say, "Yes."
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.540]   And they say, "No wonder."
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.780]   And I say, "How do you know?"
[00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.100]   And then they say, "I can tell."
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:46.300]   The other day, I'm just, "Oh, if you are submissive, if you are serving, you don't need an announcement.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.020]   People will know you.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.260]   They will know you're a Christian."
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.700]   I don't know whether you do this in this church.
[00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.820]   Just tell the next person seated to you, "They will know you."
[00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.460]   Oh, yes.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:05.180]   They will know you.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:11.060]   Let's read the scripture there.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.900]   Can I have a scripture come up?
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.340]   Matthew chapter 5.
[00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:26.700]   In the same way, let your light shine before men that they may see your good work and glorify
[00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:30.980]   your Father which is in heaven.
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:33.540]   You may not evangelize, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.300]   You may not know how to speak, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:41.340]   You may not have money to give, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:46.740]   But whatever little you do, it counts.
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:53.620]   It might draw someone to Christ and glorify our Father which is in heaven.
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:59.740]   Let your light so shine.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:02.260]   Don't hide the light.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.580]   Everyone here has something to do.
[00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.620]   We've heard this over and over.
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.260]   We have been equipped.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:16.300]   And the last point, ladies and gentlemen, I want to say, when you serve, you are but
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.940]   keeping what has been entrusted unto you.
[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.580]   Serving is stewardship.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:30.300]   Listen, if you have been given something to keep, it is not yours.
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:35.860]   If you have been entrusted with something, you've got to take care of it.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.180]   And how do we take care of what God has given unto us?
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:42.780]   We take care by serving others with it.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:50.220]   We take care of what God has given unto us by, you know, blessing others.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:55.460]   I remember a niece of mine in Zambia.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:37:01.260]   She is so prayerful, very young, and she goes in the community.
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:07.940]   She finds people that are sick and then she washes them.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.900]   These are people that are living alone.
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.100]   She washes them.
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.380]   She does the dishes.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:16.460]   She does the cleaning and everything, the laundry.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.660]   She did this for a long time and she had very good results.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:25.780]   And somebody just came to her and said, "Hey, I'm looking for somebody to employ as a house
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.260]   maid, as a house help."
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.300]   And my niece was employed.
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:36.340]   And this kind woman looked at her and said, "Esnet, what do you want to do in life?
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:38.260]   Do you have your school results?"
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.420]   She produced her school results and said, "These are good results.
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.460]   How come you're not doing nothing?"
[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.780]   And she says, "I have no money to go to college."
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.100]   And she says, "Okay, what do you want to do?"
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.140]   "I want to do nursing."
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:56.060]   Not because she wants to do nursing for the sake of it, but it is in her heart.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.620]   That's a gift.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:03.820]   She wants to keep this gift as a steward by passing on unto others.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.220]   And God expanded her.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.340]   Instead of saving a few people, she's going to save a lot of people that are walking into
[00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:15.540]   the hospital.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:20.020]   What God has given us should be used to the benefit of others.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:23.540]   We need to bless others with what has been trusted.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:34.500]   Luke 12 verse 48, and then we'll be done.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:53.300]   But the one who did not know and did what deserved a beating will receive a light beating.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:58.540]   One to whom much was given of much will be required.
[00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:04.980]   And from him to whom they entrusted much, they will demand more.
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:11.420]   Ladies and gentlemen, I want to say, if you have a great gift, your responsibility should
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.860]   be great.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:16.620]   If you have a greater one, your responsibility should be greater.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.920]   It's not for you to keep.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.340]   It's not for you to enjoy.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.180]   It's for you to pass on to others.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.020]   It's for you to serve others.
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:29.700]   It's for you to obey and go with it and say, "Somebody needs to benefit from this."
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.340]   To whom much is given, much is required.
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:37.340]   KFC, you have been equipped.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:42.100]   Much has been offloaded by people that are coming, by passing on.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.700]   And other pastors in this church, they have equipped.
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.340]   They keep to equip.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:53.220]   So that equipping is not for the sake of us receiving, but we need to go out there so
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:58.900]   that we are strengthened, so that other people can benefit.
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:02.060]   Much has been given and it's time to stand.
[00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:06.180]   It's time to go.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:14.540]   I want to encourage you to do something.
[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:23.180]   Having heard all of these things in Hong Kong and elsewhere, what are you going to do about
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.180]   it?
[00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:27.500]   Listen to me.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.300]   There is something that you can do.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:35.180]   I remember Pastor John said, "You can start from somewhere."
[00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.620]   Let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, we started a makeshift school.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.660]   We started from somewhere.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:46.260]   Incomplete buildings and we started.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:54.740]   Do you know those kids that passed through those dirty walls, some of them are doctors
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.180]   today.
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:59.020]   Some of them are teachers today.
[00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.260]   Remember I said these are children that were written off.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.020]   It took submission.
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:07.740]   It took realization that we need to speak.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:13.600]   It took realization that we need to be stewards.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.020]   So you can do something.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.860]   You can start from somewhere.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.700]   Right now if you have a phone, this is the only time that you're going to be allowed,
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.500]   I guess, to use a phone in the church.
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.300]   I would like you to grab a phone.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.500]   Take it out now.
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.140]   Let's do this.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:38.260]   If you want to mark a time when you will pray for any cause that is dear to your heart,
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.260]   mark it.
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.580]   Make a calendar, make an alarm.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:46.500]   When they want to pray for the refugees or maybe you want to pray for this mother that
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.320]   I've been sharing about.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.740]   It could be baby.
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:50.740]   It could be the mother.
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.740]   Pray for their salvation.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:54.860]   Pray for healing.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:55.860]   Pray for resources.
[00:41:55.860 --> 00:42:00.100]   Pray that their needs be met.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:05.180]   The other thing that you can do is to just educate yourself.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.900]   You see what I did?
[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:14.700]   I went online and said, "Which organizations can do repair works for people free?"
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.460]   And I found this one.
[00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.140]   You can do the same.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.540]   I'm not saying you should find organizations that help people.
[00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:27.380]   Find organizations that you can help.
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:33.980]   Organizations that you can be a part of, to work in, to partner with, or even to pray
[00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:34.980]   for.
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:35.980]   It's good.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.980]   It's good yourself.
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:37.980]   That's what I did.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:38.980]   That's what I did.
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.380]   Thankfully, I found Build and Wish.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.780]   So do research.
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:49.860]   Having done that, you need to just say, "Okay, I want to volunteer."
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:50.860]   Get involved.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.460]   Do something.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:43:03.500]   Whatever you do, in summary, I want to say serving is an act.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:08.020]   An act of submission.
[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:11.780]   Serving speaks.
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:18.500]   Serving is stewardship.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.460]   All these things, it's all about Jesus.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:25.100]   It's all about Jesus.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.180]   It's all about Jesus.
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.180]   It's all about Jesus.
[00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.300]   It's going to give you inner peace.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.620]   It's all about Jesus.
[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.980]   Saved people serve.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:39.980]   Thank you very much.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:39.980]   [Applause]
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:43.340]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.700]   [APPLAUSE]
