00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 (audio cuts out)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,480
 - Good evening, everyone.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,560
 My name is Michelle,

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,480
 and I serve as one of the pastors here.

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,160
 This is your very first time.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,360
 Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,960
 Now we live in a day and age

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,680
 where everything seems to be true

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,200
 as long as you have enough conviction

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,960
 and passion about it.

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,440
 I mean, we hear about these slimming products, right?

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,960
 We wanna slim down ourselves,

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,760
 or we hear these hair growth products,

14
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,480
 or we have all these books that teach us

15
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,520
 how to be successful, or just get the right stocks

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,720
 so then we can have more money, right?

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,240
 And so we tend to just follow things here and there,

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,400
 and we think that, oh, this is true, or that is true.

19
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,080
 And we're tossed and turned around

20
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,960
 as if we're in the waves.

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,960
 And so today we're really gonna look at what is the truth?

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:59,920
 What is the truth that Paul here really urges

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,800
 and commands Timothy to uphold?

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,800
 And how is it that we can uphold it in our everyday lives?

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,680
 And as the scripture is here in 1 Timothy,

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,520
 the very first chapter,

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,800
 now Apostle Paul here is charging Timothy,

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,760
 who literally is brought up in faith by Paul.

29
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,480
 And he's saying to him, "Stay there," verse three,

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,100
 "in Ephesus so that you may command certain people,"

31
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,780
 not everyone, just some,

32
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,480
 "not to teach false doctrines any longer,

33
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,840
 "or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,940
 "Such things promote controversial speculations

35
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,800
 "rather than advancing God's work, which is by faith."

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
 Now we look at this and we know that, okay,

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,360
 there are false teachings,

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,120
 but what are they?

39
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,160
 Now, Paul does not specify exactly what those are,

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,960
 but we actually look and reference to chapter six, verse three

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,080
 which we're not gonna look at, but I will let you know.

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,040
 What is it?

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
 They are the things that go against Jesus's teaching.

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,200
 And they are the things that don't bring people

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,440
 to godliness.

46
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
 And so whatever those things are,

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,040
 those are the false teachings that Paul is addressing here.

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,400
 And at the same time,

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,680
 these people also devote themselves to myths

50
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,280
 and endless genealogies.

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,200
 And myths are like those far-fetched stories.

52
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,000
 They're like things, they're stories,

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,320
 made up ones about gods of other sorts.

54
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,360
 And also what are endless genealogies?

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,120
 Well, at those times, people like to look at the bloodline

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,120
 to see what it is that they're entitled to,

57
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,360
 rather it's priesthood that they can do or other things.

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,440
 And so they just spend all this time doing all these things.

59
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,600
 And that's why Apostle Paul's telling Timothy,

60
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,520
 "Hey, stay there,

61
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,760
 "because there's all these things that are going on."

62
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,880
 And not only that,

63
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,760
 but they would promote controversial speculations.

64
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,040
 They might be about how did things happen in the past

65
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,040
 or things about how are they gonna happen in the future?

66
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,360
 And actually in a similar sense,

67
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,680
 we might be like that today as well.

68
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,560
 We might believe in myths and stories.

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,640
 We actually are quite interested sometimes

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,560
 when people tell us,

71
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,560
 "Hey, you know, this is probably how things have happened

72
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,400
 "in the past."

73
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,160
 And we're like, "Oh, tell me more about it."

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,000
 'Cause it's fascinating to hear these stories.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,560
 Or we're interested in mythological things

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,040
 or mysterious things.

77
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,520
 And sometimes when we hear about angelic beings,

78
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,480
 our ears turn up like, "Oh, tell me more.

79
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,280
 "I wanna know more about angels."

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,880
 Or like, "What's going to happen?

81
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,440
 "What about end time?"

82
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,240
 And I have friends who would say,

83
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,640
 "Oh, you know what?

84
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,320
 "Jesus is gonna come back during my lifetime."

85
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,640
 And I'll be like, "Oh, how do you know about that?"

86
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,080
 And they will say, "Well, I just know

87
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,520
 "this is gonna happen."

88
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,920
 And so they tend to base it on things

89
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
 that are just myths, stories,

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,600
 or things that give them a hunch.

91
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,160
 And then also, we spend also time

92
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,680
 where sometimes we might match the current events

93
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,640
 with what's happening in the Bible, right?

94
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,960
 Oh, this is the symbol it stands for.

95
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,600
 And if we have a certain leader

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,120
 that we think are unethical,

97
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,560
 we might say, "Oh, look, they have the sign

98
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,560
 "of the mark of 666, that's Satan."

99
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,040
 And so we start having all these speculations.

100
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,600
 But what it's really saying here,

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,760
 and if we go to verse six,

102
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,320
 and it tells us that some of them

103
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,000
 have departed from these which are the truth

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
 and have turned into meaningless talks.

105
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,600
 And what is Paul's really trying to tell Timothy

106
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,880
 and also to us is that stay focused

107
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,080
 on what's important, which is the truth

108
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,640
 in which we will look at.

109
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,160
 And you see, these people in verse seven,

110
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,080
 they said, "They want to be teachers of law,

111
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,720
 "but they do not know what they're talking about

112
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,040
 "or what they so confidently affirm."

113
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,520
 So what we do see is that these people,

114
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,800
 they don't lack aspiration.

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,360
 They wanna be teachers of law,

116
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,320
 so they have this desire.

117
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,360
 And also, they're confidently affirmed

118
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,600
 in what they wanna talk about.

119
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,040
 So what that tells us is they're really zealous for it,

120
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,000
 they're passionate about it.

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,840
 But just because they have these two things,

122
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,520
 it's not enough, because here,

123
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,160
 they don't have the most crucial thing,

124
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,040
 which in the scripture, it tells us,

125
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,600
 they do not know what they are talking about.

126
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,440
 So what is it that they lack?

127
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,360
 Understanding.

128
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
 They don't have understanding.

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,640
 And so this brings us to our first point,

130
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,920
 which is in order to uphold the truth,

131
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,600
 we must have true understanding of it.

132
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,600
 Now, we might be thinking, well, what is true understanding?

133
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,240
 Well, the teachers and all these false teachers

134
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
 seem to get it at some level.

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,200
 They're like, okay, I get this, I get that.

136
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
 But they don't have true understanding.

137
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,920
 And what we see is that Apostle Paul

138
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,200
 actually struggled with that as well.

139
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,680
 At some point in his life,

140
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,840
 he was actually persecuting Christians.

141
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,720
 And here in verse 13, he even wove in his own experience,

142
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,280
 and he said, "I was once a blasphemer,

143
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,880
 a persecutor, a violent man," and see what he says,

144
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,400
 "and acted in ignorance and unbelief."

145
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,720
 He also claimed that at some point in his life,

146
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,120
 he was ignorant.

147
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,840
 He had no idea what the real meaning is, what's important.

148
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,120
 And that's what happened with the false teacher.

149
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,320
 They don't have true understanding.

150
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,920
 And later we see that Paul had such a big turnaround

151
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,920
 that he actually told us what is the proper use of the law.

152
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,520
 And we see in verse nine, he names it out.

153
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,640
 "The law is made not for the righteous.

154
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,160
 "It isn't that these laws will gain you righteousness,

155
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,560
 "but it is for the lawbreakers, the rebels,

156
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,520
 "the ungodly and the sinful, the unholy, irreligious,

157
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,280
 "for those who kill their fathers or mothers,

158
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,640
 "for those murderers, for the sexually immoral,

159
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,960
 "practicing homosexual, slave traders, liars,

160
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,040
 "perjurers, and whatever else

161
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,680
 "is contrary to the sound doctrine."

162
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,280
 And once he had this full understanding

163
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,200
 of what the truth is, he knows also

164
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,680
 what the meaning is for the law and how to use it.

165
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,080
 Now I wanna kind of give an example

166
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,360
 about how sometimes we kind of get things,

167
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,120
 but we don't really get it.

168
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,200
 I mean, for example, you might have a girlfriend

169
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,520
 or your wife may ask you,

170
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,720
 "Oh, I would like some flowers."

171
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,720
 Okay, so yes, on the surface level, they want flowers.

172
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,240
 And that's how we can understand it too, you know?

173
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,800
 But really, what is the true meaning or the goal behind it

174
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,720
 is actually that she wants the guy

175
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 to display the adoration and the love that he has for her.

176
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,200
 Now, if he gets that,

177
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,120
 then that means he understood the true meaning

178
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,280
 of why he asked for flowers.

179
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,160
 And on the contrary, the same,

180
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,840
 when the boyfriend or the husband says to his girl,

181
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,840
 "Listen to what I say."

182
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,520
 And on the surface, it's like

183
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,560
 just listening to what he wants.

184
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,320
 And if we get that as the female or as the girl,

185
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,700
 then we only understand the surface level of it.

186
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,400
 But what is it that's the goal

187
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,680
 or what is it that's the meaning behind it?

188
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,000
 Well, what he's really desiring is respect

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,960
 and also trust when he tells the girl to do something.

190
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,560
 So in a similar way, you know,

191
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,280
 we might understand the Bible

192
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,400
 or we might understand the truth,

193
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,160
 but only in the surface level.

194
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,280
 And if we don't understand the meaning behind it,

195
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,840
 then we've missed the point,

196
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,360
 we've missed the goal of what the truth is talking about.

197
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,920
 And so here we see that the false teachers

198
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,440
 have misunderstood a few things.

199
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,080
 They devoted themselves to the wrong things

200
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,400
 and they don't even know how to use law properly.

201
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,900
 And they don't know where righteousness come from,

202
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,200
 which is Jesus, and they've missed the goal.

203
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,720
 And in verse five, it tells us the goal of everything

204
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,320
 and the truth is love.

205
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,640
 So how do we experience,

206
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,640
 how is it possible that we can have this true understanding?

207
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,120
 'Cause I mean, okay, now we have established

208
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,960
 a true understanding is important.

209
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,440
 We need to know the meaning and the goal behind everything.

210
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,700
 But how is it that we can achieve it?

211
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,600
 Well, if we look at the false teacher and Paul,

212
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
 what is their greatest difference?

213
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,040
 I mean, what's the difference between them,

214
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,800
 these false teachers and Apostle Paul?

215
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,240
 What's the difference?

216
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:32,320
 Well, the difference is that Paul had experienced this truth

217
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,840
 and the false teacher did not.

218
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,680
 What does it mean to experience something?

219
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,240
 Well, it's kind of like,

220
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,280
 what if you had to explain to someone

221
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,120
 what it's like to swim?

222
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,540
 And if you've never swam yourself,

223
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,920
 you might've heard about what it is

224
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,200
 so you can tell them all the correct description about it.

225
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,800
 Oh, swimming is like this, it's like this, it's like this.

226
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,640
 But then even as you're seeing it,

227
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,840
 you don't truly understand what it feels like to swim

228
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,280
 unless you go and get into the water

229
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,460
 and you start like moving your arms

230
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,440
 and allow that water to splash your head.

231
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
 And in the same way,

232
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,760
 the truth cannot be fully understood

233
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,680
 unless we've experienced it.

234
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,160
 Now, I don't wanna say that any kind of experience

235
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,040
 that you have make that a truth, okay?

236
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,740
 Just because you've experienced something

237
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,640
 and it has worked for you, it doesn't mean it's a truth.

238
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,540
 But if it is truth and the gospel,

239
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,760
 the salvation of our Jesus Christ, our Lord is true,

240
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,040
 then we should and we need to experience it.

241
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,640
 And that's when it's real to us.

242
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,700
 That's when we have conviction

243
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,120
 and that's where we will gain true understanding.

244
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,280
 And so here it brings us,

245
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:59,400
 and here it brings us to an important part,

246
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,320
 which is unless we have true experience of the truth,

247
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,580
 we will always stay at just the surface level

248
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,320
 of understanding it.

249
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,840
 So we must get ourselves wet,

250
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,000
 we must get into the water

251
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,480
 and truly experience this truth.

252
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,100
 And so in here, in verse 14,

253
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,100
 when Paul had experiences for his own,

254
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,780
 for his personal firsthand experience,

255
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,060
 this is what he said,

256
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,660
 "The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly,

257
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,500
 along with the faith and the love that are in Christ Jesus."

258
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,660
 Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance.

259
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:48,700
 "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners,

260
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,160
 of whom I am the worst."

261
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,040
 Now, you see, he could not fully understand this statement

262
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,720
 until he himself was shown grace.

263
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,080
 And in order that he would be shown grace,

264
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,080
 it's a very crucial enlightenment that he must have,

265
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,960
 which is that he is a sinner.

266
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,720
 And in here, he clearly says, "Of whom I am the worst."

267
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,360
 And you see, because he saw how much sins he had,

268
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,160
 he was able to comprehend,

269
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,320
 to experience the amount of grace

270
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,680
 he also received from the Lord.

271
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,680
 And so if we have only experienced a little bit of sin,

272
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,920
 well, we can only experience a little bit of his mercy.

273
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,360
 And maybe that's our problem.

274
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,760
 I mean, how many of you here,

275
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,720
 you can fully say that I am the worst of all sinners?

276
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,840
 Put up your hand if there's one out there.

277
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,640
 Oh, there's one hand.

278
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,800
 Oh, there's another one.

279
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
 There's another one, maybe here and there.

280
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,860
 But you know, we're somehow like,

281
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,480
 we don't even wanna go all the way, right?

282
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,720
 We're like, yeah, kind of.

283
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,240
 You know, there's always someone worse than me.

284
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,640
 You know, I can't, I don't know if I'm the worst.

285
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,880
 And I'm not saying that, you know,

286
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,280
 go out and do something bad

287
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,080
 so you are the worst after you repent, okay?

288
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,560
 It's not my point.

289
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,840
 But my point is maybe our problem

290
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,520
 is that we don't really think we're that bad.

291
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,160
 I mean, we haven't killed anybody.

292
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,940
 I hope, okay, if you did,

293
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,840
 I don't know if you should let me know, but okay.

294
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,600
 We haven't, and we haven't stolen anything, hopefully.

295
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,800
 And so it's hard for us to gauge.

296
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,880
 I mean, we wanna love the Lord.

297
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,000
 We know that we're sinners, but in our head,

298
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,880
 but we don't really see ourselves that bad.

299
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,840
 How are we gonna like receive that mercy and love

300
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,000
 that the Bible always talks about?

301
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,960
 And that's kind of the same with me

302
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,120
 when my first two decades of my walk with the Lord,

303
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,880
 I know I look really young and I still am really young.

304
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,960
 I mean, the first two decades of my walk,

305
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,880
 and I believe when I was really extremely young,

306
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,080
 the first two decades when I walked with the Lord,

307
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,920
 I went to church, the Bible study,

308
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,720
 and I knew when I did the sinner's prayer

309
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,760
 and, but I just always felt that I'm not that bad.

310
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,160
 And because of that, for the longest time,

311
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,120
 I can't really feel or experience

312
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,400
 the amount of love and mercy.

313
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,620
 And it wasn't until that I was in a ditch

314
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,880
 that I prayed to the Lord, Lord, please show me the truth.

315
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,320
 And I didn't even know what the truth is.

316
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,480
 I just did that prayer.

317
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,320
 And I believe that it was the Holy Spirit then

318
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,520
 who opened my eyes and, you know,

319
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,240
 like I believe it was a few days later and I was like,

320
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,800
 oh my God, I actually saw myself.

321
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,400
 I was like, I didn't know I was this prideful,

322
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,760
 but all of a sudden I saw it.

323
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,160
 And I didn't know that I was that boastful

324
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,560
 or I didn't know I was still selfish

325
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,120
 and everything was about me.

326
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,040
 And, and, you know, in the Bible,

327
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,840
 it says that you don't have to kill someone

328
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,700
 in order to commit that sin.

329
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,260
 Even if you hate it, you're brothers,

330
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,360
 you're already liable to it.

331
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,560
 So what he's really saying is our sinful nature.

332
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,880
 So you don't have to kill anybody to do that,

333
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,360
 but we can't really see it

334
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,000
 until Holy Spirit shows it to us.

335
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,120
 And so if you feel like, you know,

336
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,940
 oh, I've understood the gospel so many years,

337
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,880
 but I don't really sense the mercy

338
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,120
 or the love that God has.

339
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,040
 I know his love.

340
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,800
 I don't say that you don't know,

341
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,280
 but I don't experience it.

342
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,960
 And then I really urge you to pray that prayer

343
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,120
 where you ask God, show me the truth,

344
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,840
 show me who I am so that I could see who you are.

345
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,800
 And that's exactly what happened to Paul,

346
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,800
 that he saw how Jesus had abundantly poured out

347
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,240
 his grace to him when he saw

348
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,080
 that he was the worst of sinners.

349
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,160
 So let us really experience, jump in if you haven't,

350
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,520
 'cause I feel like we might be here

351
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,560
 like dipping our toes into the pool,

352
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,960
 but not really like jumping in.

353
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,420
 That's what we need to do.

354
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:13,300
 And so having said that, he continues on,

355
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,680
 and he really tells us

356
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:21,840
 that as we are holding onto this truth,

357
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,120
 something changes inside of us.

358
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,320
 And he becomes so sure that he says,

359
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,520
 this statement is trustworthy.

360
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,460
 This is a full acceptance

361
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,540
 because he had experienced it for himself.

362
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:47,300
 And so I just wanted to say that for him,

363
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,640
 this gospel for Paul has been entrusted to him.

364
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,280
 And he says in verse 22,

365
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,760
 I'm trying to find where my verse went.

366
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,520
 Now he said in verse 16,

367
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,080
 "But for that very reason, I was shown mercy

368
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,560
 so that in me, the worst of sinners,

369
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,800
 Christ Jesus might displace his immense patience

370
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,560
 as an example.

371
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,560
 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible,

372
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,880
 the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever."

373
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,880
 This is an important turnaround

374
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,960
 because he sees that the purpose for him

375
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
 to understand the truth, to experience it,

376
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,140
 there's only one reason,

377
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,140
 and that is so Christ Jesus may be displayed in him.

378
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,000
 This is for the purpose.

379
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,720
 And he sees it because this has been entrusted to him.

380
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,200
 And it has been entrusted to us as well.

381
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,040
 And this brings us to our third point,

382
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,800
 which is when we uphold the truth,

383
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,680
 we need to be true vessels of it.

384
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,080
 Now, Paul is a true vessel because he had experienced it.

385
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,520
 And now he knows that it's been passed on to him.

386
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,840
 And every day he lives it out.

387
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,520
 And I don't know about you.

388
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,460
 Do you think you live out this truth every day?

389
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,460
 Does your life, does your decision center around this truth?

390
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,620
 And what is the truth that he says?

391
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:42,440
 That Christ Jesus came to save sinners.

392
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,480
 Do you center your life around that

393
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,840
 so that other people can see God in you?

394
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,920
 Now, for those that don't,

395
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:01,240
 I believe that there's something that God's calling us to do

396
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,560
 which is to be his true vessels.

397
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,080
 Now, sometimes we think, well, how do I do that?

398
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,420
 Because I mean, all I do is I wake up every day,

399
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,400
 I go to school, I go to work, and then I eat my dinner,

400
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,960
 and then I sleep, and I spend time with my friends

401
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,360
 and family, and what does it look like?

402
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,660
 How am I supposed to live out this truth

403
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,240
 that Jesus Christ came to die for sinners?

404
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,560
 How do I do that?

405
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:33,560
 Well, I wanna show you like an everyday life example.

406
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,560
 So a few days ago, I was going to Hot Pot,

407
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,580
 I was trying to bring my mom to a Hot Pot in Causeway Bay.

408
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,480
 So we're going, talking, having a great time,

409
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,220
 and then as we got there,

410
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,160
 you know how MTR stations are, right?

411
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,080
 There's 100 exits, and you're like, oh my goodness,

412
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,680
 which one should I go, right?

413
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,100
 Of course, I was attempting to exit the one

414
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,380
 that's closest to the restaurant,

415
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,920
 of which I did not choose

416
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,240
 because I've mistakenly exit another one.

417
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,780
 And so I was there with my mom and she's walking out there,

418
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,180
 you know, it's 35 degrees,

419
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,720
 we were both sweating a little bit,

420
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,740
 and you know, extra five minutes outdoor.

421
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,060
 And then she turns to me and then she said,

422
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,220
 you know, if you don't know where you're going,

423
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,080
 just let me know.

424
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,560
 And then she's like, you have no sense of direction anyways.

425
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,420
 And then she's saying, okay, you know,

426
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,900
 last time when you were trying to bring me to Disneyland,

427
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,580
 and we were already in Kowloon,

428
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,540
 I brought her to Central, and then I brought her back.

429
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,420
 (audience laughing)

430
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,980
 And then the other time we were in like Korea,

431
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,560
 and then she's like, you made me walk in circles, you know?

432
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,240
 And I wanted to say at that point,

433
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,480
 I realized that I was flushing a bit.

434
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,680
 And then I realized, oh, you know,

435
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,720
 all I wanted to do was to take you to lunch, you know?

436
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,300
 And I felt like that I needed some grace.

437
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,420
 And it was in that moment that I realized, you know what?

438
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,900
 We can actually show grace to the people around us

439
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,480
 with the smallest things possible.

440
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,180
 We can show them how it is that Christ Jesus

441
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,460
 had died for sinners.

442
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,260
 And you're like, whoa, isn't this a far fetch?

443
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,240
 But imagine that day if you had just said nothing

444
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,500
 or said, hey, you know, it's a nice walk out,

445
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,140
 look at these stores, I haven't seen them some time.

446
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,700
 It would have been very different.

447
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,300
 And I don't wanna pick on my mom, which I just did.

448
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,420
 (audience laughing)

449
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,540
 But I wanna say that happens to me all the time as well.

450
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:33,220
 So my mom calls when I'm preparing this sermon,

451
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,300
 and I'm like, mom, can you just get off the phone?

452
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,300
 And I wanted to show her no patience, you know?

453
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,380
 I'm like, I'm working on this,

454
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,540
 like take care of your own problems.

455
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,460
 Or this other time when someone has wronged me,

456
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,380
 and then I'm trying to WhatsApp another person.

457
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,340
 Hey, you know, guess what that person did?

458
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,420
 It's so wrong.

459
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,700
 And I even screen captured it, you know,

460
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,220
 screenshot our conversation.

461
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,740
 And I realized, what, I'm just being so judgmental

462
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,300
 at that time.

463
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,920
 That is not what the truth is.

464
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,300
 And just when I, you know, going through these,

465
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,080
 I was like, it's not the big things.

466
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,660
 I mean, yes, also the big things,

467
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,900
 but it's also the small things.

468
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,540
 And maybe that's why a lot of non-believers

469
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,980
 call Christians hypocrites,

470
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,020
 because you say your God's this way,

471
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,660
 but I'm not experienced Him like that through you.

472
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:27,860
 But imagine if every day, the little things that we do,

473
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,420
 that we display Christ Jesus,

474
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,820
 we display this truth in our lives.

475
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,460
 Would they not turn to Christ and say,

476
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,700
 what is this God that you believe?

477
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,900
 And then what made that look like in a workplace?

478
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,280
 I mean, there might be a coworker,

479
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,180
 which you hate inside of you,

480
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,740
 but I'm sure you're forgiving him already.

481
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,380
 And he goes and makes a big mistake.

482
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,100
 What is it that you would do?

483
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,240
 Would you go and rub it in?

484
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,420
 Or would you graciously give him a hand?

485
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:06,420
 And like, what if like your wife nags you for the 10th time?

486
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,620
 Oh, this is something that's really bothering me.

487
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,420
 What do you do?

488
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,580
 Do you like patiently listens to her cry and respond?

489
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,140
 Or do you just say, (speaks in foreign language)

490
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,420
 or just like, oh, it's annoying.

491
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,380
 What do you do?

492
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,620
 What do we do?

493
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,020
 And what do we need to do?

494
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:33,020
 And God tells us, be true vessels of the truth.

495
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,560
 And really, I don't know,

496
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,560
 maybe it's because we don't fully understand the gospel.

497
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,720
 Maybe we haven't experienced the mercy

498
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,400
 so we can't give mercy to others.

499
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,060
 I don't know what it is.

500
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,480
 Or maybe it can just be like me

501
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,480
 where I forgot to uphold it and just slipped.

502
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,840
 But whatever it is, God tells us

503
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,360
 that we are to uphold the truth

504
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,640
 and we are to be his vessels.

505
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,440
 And that's what Paul does.

506
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,620
 He has entrusted, or God has entrusted the gospel to him

507
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,800
 and he had been faithful.

508
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,580
 Would we too be faithful?

509
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:24,480
 Now, the truth is that Jesus Christ came to the world

510
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,000
 to save sinners.

511
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,960
 Would you and I be willing to have our lives

512
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,120
 work around it so that we're constantly displaying

513
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,920
 Jesus Christ to others around us?

514
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,480
 And even though when we were broken,

515
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,680
 Jesus came and he gathered us, he accepted us,

516
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:54,680
 he shown us mercy, he forgave us and made us whole.

517
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,660
 Would you be willing to display that same love to others?

518
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,940
 So if you don't, if you feel like,

519
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,180
 oh, I don't really fully understand,

520
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:13,540
 I don't really fully experienced his mercy and love,

521
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,960
 please pray that the Holy Spirit opens your eyes,

522
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,420
 enlightens you to your sins.

523
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,020
 Then you will see the mercy

524
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,780
 and be able to let that flow out.

525
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,660
 If you already understood everything

526
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,620
 and then experienced it,

527
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:33,380
 then let us live that out in our everyday lives

528
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,380
 because all of this is actually for one purpose.

529
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,480
 And that is so the eternal King,

530
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,260
 the invisible God would be given glory and honor.

531
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,420
 Let us pray together.

532
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:54,220
 Dear heavenly Father,

533
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,620
 thank you for giving us Jesus.

534
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:02,660
 Thank you for showing us how much you love us,

535
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,980
 that while we were sinners,

536
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,980
 you already came for us to wash away our sins.

537
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:14,980
 And maybe some of us here understood it in our head,

538
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,620
 but have not experienced it.

539
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,620
 I pray, Father, that your Holy Spirit will open up our eyes

540
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,040
 so that we would see ourselves,

541
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,500
 so that we could see how much you love us.

542
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,260
 And Father, we just pray

543
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,980
 that you will help us in our everyday life

544
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,980
 to be that vessel to show everyone

545
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,860
 in the big things and small things

546
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,780
 who it is that lives inside of us.

547
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,520
 In Jesus Christ, and we pray, amen.
