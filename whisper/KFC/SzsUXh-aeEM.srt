1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,700
 Good evening, everybody.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,560
 One day I was invited to the Chinese International School in Fremont Hill.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,440
 It was billed as their religion day.

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:27,020
 Also invited were a Catholic priest, a Buddhist monk, and a Jewish rabbi.

5
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:32,640
 We all had the opportunity to address the pupils.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,080
 And this was followed by a series of questions and answers.

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,420
 The very last question was this.

8
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:48,420
 How does your religion differ from all the others?

9
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:58,040
 My fellow panelists all gave a similar answer, albeit dressed in a slightly different format.

10
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:04,700
 Basically what they were saying is that we are all the same and it is just a different

11
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,320
 way of expressing it.

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,140
 I was the last to answer.

13
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:23,200
 I said, I can see where my colleagues are coming from, but sadly I cannot agree with

14
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,960
 that answer.

15
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:35,740
 For in Christianity we have this thing called grace, G-R-A-C-E, God's riches at Christ's

16
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,800
 expense.

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:48,080
 In fact I said that Christianity is not so much a religion as a relationship.

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:58,180
 It's not about us trying to reach God by good works and devotion, but instead God reaching

19
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:04,160
 us through the death of his son, Jesus Christ.

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:12,180
 Suffice to say I was not invited back the next year.

21
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,440
 We are in the eighth week of our series, Don't Give the Enemy a Seat at Your Table.

22
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:27,220
 We've been looking at the dangers of exposing our lives to the evil one, giving him an inch

23
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,280
 and watching him take a mile.

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:41,960
 We have looked at his deadly lies exposed, the spiral of sin and taking every thought

25
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,960
 captive.

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:52,160
 We've been speaking about denying the enemy.

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:00,520
 But what happens if you give the enemy a seat at your table?

28
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,080
 Acting, chin, can you be the enemy for a minute?

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
 Can you just sit down?

30
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,760
 Give him a round of applause.

31
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,280
 Nothing personal.

32
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,460
 What happens if you give the enemy a seat at your table anyway?

33
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,360
 Is that curtains?

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,200
 The end of our series, finito?

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,380
 And that's where my CIS answer comes in.

36
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,160
 The answer is simple.

37
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,120
 No.

38
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:54,640
 The essence of the gospel is that God forgives sins through Jesus Christ and makes you new.

39
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,400
 But there is a requirement.

40
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
 Confession.

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,360
 Confession when you repent, God wipes out your sins.

42
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:16,320
 God forgives you and cleanses you and God ejects the devil from your table.

43
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,120
 Thank you.

44
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,640
 Look at this, Proverbs 28, 13.

45
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:32,960
 Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes

46
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,000
 them will obtain mercy.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:51,760
 Yet you know, even after we confess our sins, two things often linger.

48
00:04:51,760 --> 00:05:03,160
 Those two things are guilt and shame.

49
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,880
 Guilt and shame.

50
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,760
 Often they get lumped together, but they're actually very different.

51
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:20,000
 Guilt is the position of being accountable for sins and shortcoming.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,160
 It's a legal term that points to remorse.

53
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,360
 We get examples of it when we have our courts with the judge.

54
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,280
 I remember a few years ago, it was my birthday.

55
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,600
 Sandra remember this?

56
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,160
 You didn't tell me where we were going, do you remember?

57
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,520
 And I was driving the car and I was actually just here going up towards Cotton Tree Drive

58
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,280
 and a policeman stopped me.

59
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,680
 He said, "You are guilty of careless driving."

60
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,640
 Careless driving me?

61
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,160
 Anyway, I get a letter through the post.

62
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,760
 I had to go to court.

63
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,800
 The judge was there.

64
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,200
 Have you anything to say before I give sentence?

65
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,940
 No.

66
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,160
 So what I got was points and a fine.

67
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,040
 I was guilty.

68
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:30,000
 And yet in spiritual terms, you've given the enemy a seat at your table.

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:41,660
 Fear, pride, anxiety, lust, a lack of trust.

70
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,080
 The gavel comes down, the verdict comes in.

71
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:56,800
 You've fallen short of the glory of God and yes, you are responsible for it.

72
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,040
 You are guilty.

73
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:11,080
 Shame on the other hand, is the feeling of being defined by your sin and shortcomings.

74
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:22,080
 Shame acknowledges guilt, yet somehow intertwines the sin with your identity.

75
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,200
 Guilt is a legal and spiritual state.

76
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:31,080
 Shame is an emotional and mental state.

77
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,040
 In guilt, you admit you did something wrong.

78
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,640
 I have done something wrong.

79
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,560
 I have fought something bad.

80
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:55,200
 In shame, you take the sin upon yourself and you say, I am something wrong.

81
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,720
 I am bad.

82
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:08,880
 Even though they are separate, guilt and shame have the same solution.

83
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,600
 And I need to tell you this tonight.

84
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:24,680
 The pathway to freedom from both guilt and shame is the story of grace.

85
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,600
 Spiritual justice has a social framework and restitution.

86
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:37,960
 That's how I got my 12 points, or where I was on my license and my fine.

87
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:46,320
 Yet the ultimate solution is always the grace of God.

88
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,560
 There are many people in this room, many people listening online, who are walking around like

89
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,800
 this.

90
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:08,320
 You're walking around and you're carrying the weight of guilt and shame.

91
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:17,480
 It prevents us from walking in the freedom purchased for us at the cross.

92
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:25,200
 My friends, it doesn't have to be that way.

93
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,080
 We can have victory.

94
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,520
 I love this expression.

95
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,640
 I'll put it on the screen.

96
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,680
 The grit, the grit of grace.

97
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:47,380
 The pathway of freedom is open to all people in the covering of grace.

98
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,920
 But it's not airy fairy or flimsy.

99
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:59,420
 Grace has grit, backbone and muscle.

100
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,760
 You remember the film True Grit with John Wayne.

101
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,840
 There's nothing airy fairy about John Wayne, I tell you.

102
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:16,580
 Shane once said, "Grace is the left hook that destroys the power of sin."

103
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:26,860
 Firstly, let's see how grace destroys shame.

104
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,660
 Shame is a powerfully destructive force.

105
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:37,660
 It causes you to feel as if you're unworthy of God's love, unworthy of God's acceptance,

106
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,740
 purposes and plans.

107
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:51,900
 Shame causes us to feel so marred, so strongly that we feel damaged beyond repair.

108
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,900
 When you feel shame, you're always trying to hide.

109
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:09,500
 You try and hide from God behind denial or by trying to keep out of his way.

110
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,620
 Or you hide from people.

111
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:21,580
 You hide behind layers, walls, titles, accomplishments or in Hong Kong, especially busyness.

112
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,620
 You don't want anyone to know you.

113
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,300
 So you keep people away at arm's length.

114
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:37,940
 Or you don't want people to know what happened to you.

115
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:45,220
 Shame imprisons you and me to the past.

116
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:52,140
 How very telling that when God created Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, we read in

117
00:11:52,140 --> 00:12:04,300
 Genesis 2.25, "And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed."

118
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:10,580
 Everything that God created was described as good and being naked and unashamed was

119
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,860
 part of the goodness of paradise.

120
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,100
 Yes, the garden was beautiful.

121
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,300
 Yes, there were plants and food and animals.

122
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,060
 Everything was in perfect condition.

123
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:38,180
 Note that the ultimate description of goodness in paradise was a lack of shame.

124
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,260
 The Hebrew word for this was al-min.

125
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:50,140
 It means naked and unashamed.

126
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,580
 Then came the fall.

127
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:02,060
 Adam and Eve made disastrous decisions that resulted in huge consequences.

128
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,460
 Earth broke apart as a result of their choices.

129
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:17,980
 And both guilt and shame entered into this story and into ours too.

130
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,660
 One minute, Adam and Eve were naked and unashamed.

131
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:32,640
 The next minute, they were hiding from God, trying to cover themselves with fig leaves.

132
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:39,200
 They had exchanged the al-min, naked and unashamed, for al-rum.

133
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,700
 Notice the play here on Hebrew words.

134
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:54,260
 Al-min, al-rum, and al-rum means deceitfulness, guilt, and shame.

135
00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:01,500
 However, back in the garden, God formed a rescue plan.

136
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,060
 With Adam and Eve, he clothed the two humans in garments of animal skin that he'd made

137
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,260
 for them.

138
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,620
 But what God did was this.

139
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:19,020
 He pointed to the future and to the cross of Jesus.

140
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:27,940
 When the serpent, representing Satan, would harm Jesus by striking his heel.

141
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,980
 But Jesus would gain full victory by crushing the serpent's head.

142
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
 Let's read it.

143
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,300
 "I will put enmity between you," that's the serpent, "and the woman, and between your

144
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,180
 offspring and her offspring.

145
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,220
 He will bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel."

146
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:56,340
 In other words, God would destroy sin and death and fully reconnect people to the purposes

147
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,780
 and the personhood of God.

148
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:14,100
 Thanks to the work of Jesus on the cross, you and I can live free from shame.

149
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:20,660
 My friends, don't let that truth pass you by.

150
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,140
 Shame does not need to be part of your story.

151
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:30,780
 We'll talk more about this in a little bit.

152
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:41,260
 Second, let's look at how grace is also the solution to guilt.

153
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:47,180
 The grace of God moves into your story and through the work of Jesus on the cross, the

154
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:55,620
 grace of God cancels your spiritual guilt and sets you free.

155
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,780
 Grace positions you rightly before God.

156
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:10,340
 Yes, there is a penalty to be paid for wrongdoings.

157
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:19,020
 Yet Jesus has already taken that penalty, the penalty of sin for you.

158
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,420
 Jesus has set you free.

159
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:31,220
 We see hints of the grace that you and I did enjoy today, even in the Old Testament.

160
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:37,620
 Go to Isaiah 6, it records the prophet Isaiah seeing a vision of the Lord and a vision of

161
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,620
 heaven.

162
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,700
 It was a beautiful and powerful vision.

163
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:50,460
 And when he saw this vision, Isaiah did not say, "Wow, that's cool."

164
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,900
 Look at Isaiah 6, verse 5.

165
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:59,620
 I said, "Woe is me, for I am lost.

166
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:06,060
 For I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips.

167
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:12,380
 For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."

168
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,060
 Isaiah felt completely shattered before God.

169
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:24,700
 He instantly saw the gap between who he was and who God is.

170
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:32,340
 Isaiah's response points us to the finished work of Jesus on the cross.

171
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:38,340
 You can step up to that finished work by the act of repentance.

172
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,060
 When you say the equivalent of Isaiah's words, "Woe is me.

173
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,020
 I've fallen short of God's holy standard.

174
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,140
 I've fallen short of God's best for my life.

175
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,300
 I take responsibility for it.

176
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,420
 I am accountable for my sin.

177
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,660
 Whether or not I admit it or respond emotionally."

178
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:04,580
 Repentance is not a negative thing.

179
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:11,940
 Your act of admitting guilt opens a doorway called grace.

180
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,780
 And God comes to you through that doorway.

181
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,900
 It does for you what none of us can do for ourselves.

182
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:28,220
 Grace was what was extended to Isaiah.

183
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:38,580
 The great news is that verses six and seven tell of an angel who flew to Isaiah with a

184
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,220
 burning coal in his hand.

185
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,300
 Let's read verse six.

186
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:53,620
 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having in his hand a burning coal that he had taken

187
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,700
 with tongs from the altar.

188
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,100
 Isaiah expected to be exterminated.

189
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:13,460
 He takes one look at the burning coal and thinks, "That's it, I'm toast."

190
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:24,540
 Instead, the angel touched Isaiah's mouth and said this.

191
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:30,980
 And he touched my mouth and said, "Behold, this has touched your lips.

192
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,540
 Your guilt is taken away.

193
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:38,820
 Your sin is atoned for."

194
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:48,100
 When we fast forward the story to the New Testament, we see another live burning coal

195
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:57,780
 has come down from heaven, the Holy One of God, Jesus Christ.

196
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:09,500
 He gave his innocent life and took our guilt on Calvary's Hill.

197
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:21,500
 Through his death, his burial, and his resurrection comes our freedom.

198
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:26,140
 Jesus was pure and innocent.

199
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:34,220
 And on the cross, a great exchange took place in heaven's courtroom.

200
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:44,060
 You and I were guilty of our sins and our shortcoming, but God took our guilt and placed

201
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:51,820
 it instead on his innocent and righteous and willing son.

202
00:20:51,820 --> 00:21:03,580
 But then God took the innocence and the righteousness of his son and made it available to us.

203
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:16,620
 To everyone who repents, God proclaims forgiveness in the same way that the seraph said to Isaiah,

204
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,300
 your guilt is taken away, your sin is atoned for.

205
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:28,020
 You are set free by a holy, righteous God.

206
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,100
 All your guilt is taken by Jesus.

207
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,500
 You are made brand new.

208
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:44,900
 I love 1 John 1.9.

209
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:55,340
 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us

210
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,500
 from all unrighteousness.

211
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,980
 Now John was actually addressing the new believers here, helping them understand the power of

212
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,180
 the gospel.

213
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,340
 And he wrote this.

214
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,660
 What it means is your acts of confession is vitally important.

215
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:20,620
 When you confess, you admit you are responsible for sin in your life.

216
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:28,600
 You are saying, I did it and it was wrong.

217
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,300
 But here is the biggest news of all.

218
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:41,700
 If you do sin as a Christian, confess your sin to clear the air in your fellowship with

219
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,540
 God.

220
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,580
 Because of the cross, you are already forgiven.

221
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,900
 Jesus is not coming back to the cross and dying again.

222
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:59,940
 It is finished, remember?

223
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:07,060
 So you say, Father, I'm sorry I've sinned.

224
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:13,200
 Thank you that I am forgiven.

225
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:22,780
 I want you to give me the grace and power to walk in a different direction.

226
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:30,080
 So what you do is you confess both your sin and his forgiveness.

227
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,900
 Now that's a reason to celebrate.

228
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:42,080
 Yet I need to tell you, the enemy will not go quietly on this one.

229
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:50,600
 He will do all he can to keep you on a guilt trip indefinitely.

230
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,960
 Do you recognize the voice of dread?

231
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,800
 Well, now I see you are a Christian.

232
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:04,980
 I see you believe you're going to heaven when you die.

233
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:13,360
 I'm going to make sure your life feels like hell right now by pointing out, pointing out

234
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,280
 to you everything that you've ever done that was wrong and everything that you're going

235
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,420
 to do in the future.

236
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
 That's right.

237
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,920
 I'm booking your tickets for a one-way cruise.

238
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,200
 You're going on a guilt trip.

239
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,720
 And I'm the captain of the ship, mister.

240
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:42,860
 My friends, it's far too easy to jump on that cruise.

241
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:50,400
 The enemy remembers everything and he'll bring back all the ugly details of your past life

242
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,640
 back to you.

243
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,440
 He works hard to convince you that if you keep your sins hidden, all will be well.

244
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:07,280
 If you just press those sins down hard enough, if you just party it up hard enough, that's

245
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,320
 what's needed to feel good.

246
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:16,320
 But my friends, that doesn't work.

247
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,320
 Your guilt is never removed when you hide.

248
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,400
 It is only when you bring your guilt into the spotlight of Christ's grace that your

249
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:35,520
 sins are atoned for and your guilt is removed.

250
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:46,840
 In Jesus's holy, loving, and kind presence, you can say, "Lord, I confess I've done some

251
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,240
 things wrong.

252
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:56,060
 I also want to let you know that I've had some wrong things done to me.

253
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:01,240
 These things have made me marred, damaged, hurt.

254
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,600
 I've been both a perpetrator of sin and a victim of sin.

255
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:14,700
 I want your forgiveness and I want your freedom.

256
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:23,680
 I want your eyes to see all that I have done and all that has been done to me."

257
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:31,300
 By your work, the effects of sin are canceled.

258
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:38,840
 By your stripes, I am healed.

259
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:49,900
 You see, grace not only cancels guilt and shame, but it also redefines you and me.

260
00:26:49,900 --> 00:27:00,200
 The biggest change in definition is from failure to family.

261
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,500
 The author Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a book in 1850 called The Scarlet Letter.

262
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,540
 You might have heard of it.

263
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:16,860
 In the story, a young woman called Hester Pryne had a baby through an affair.

264
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,240
 Hester is jailed for adultery.

265
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:30,240
 When the baby is about three months old, Hester is released from jail, her debt to society

266
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,140
 paid.

267
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:39,560
 Yet in order to shame her permanently, the townspeople make Hester stand on a scaffold

268
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:47,260
 in the town square for three hours wearing a red cloth with a letter A stitched on the

269
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,260
 front of the dress.

270
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,040
 You see, I put a picture on the screen.

271
00:27:53,040 --> 00:28:03,880
 The legacy of the public shaming will be the ongoing punishment.

272
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:11,680
 For years afterwards, Hester is treated as an outcast.

273
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,680
 She is defined by what she has done.

274
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:23,920
 Now maybe you can identify with that story because I'll be honest with you, many of you

275
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:31,040
 are walking around with a scarlet letter of your own.

276
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,600
 You're defined by your sin.

277
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,400
 You look at that letter on your chest, you say, "Yeah, that's me."

278
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,760
 Or maybe it was someone else's sin that God exported into your life, an abusive parent

279
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:52,880
 or spouse perhaps, the friends who rejected you.

280
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:59,800
 And I'll be honest, as a pastor, I see so many people walking around this city with

281
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:08,620
 an R on their chest, the R for rejection.

282
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,400
 Even then you look into the mirror and you say, "I'm damaged, I'm ruined."

283
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,640
 You take other people's failure and you wear it as your own.

284
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,880
 But God changes your identity.

285
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,600
 I love this, it's on the screen.

286
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,120
 The enemy wants to define you by your scars.

287
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:39,360
 Jesus wants to define you by his scars.

288
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,840
 Can I say it again?

289
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,720
 I love it so much.

290
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,120
 The enemy wants to define you by your scars.

291
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,960
 Jesus wants to define you by his scars.

292
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:01,920
 The grace of Jesus Christ removes your old identity and replaces it with a brand new

293
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,920
 identity.

294
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:09,280
 1 John 3 says this, "See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should

295
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,680
 be called children of God."

296
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,720
 And so we are.

297
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:20,520
 The reason why the world does not know us is it did not know him.

298
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,920
 This is your new identity.

299
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:34,000
 You are a son or a daughter of God, a child of the King.

300
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,640
 Sandra and I were updating our wills this week.

301
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,240
 If you want to find out whether you're in it, just let us know.

302
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,120
 But we've been updating our wills.

303
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:49,560
 But I need to tell you, you are written into God's will.

304
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:55,280
 You are an heir of everything that God has.

305
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,520
 Grace has redefined you.

306
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:08,160
 You are a beloved member of the family of God because you have been given a seat at

307
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,680
 his table.

308
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:17,140
 Two years ago, you remember traveling?

309
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:21,160
 We took a team from KFCI to Israel.

310
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:29,680
 And one of the places we visited was the beach where Jesus had gently restored the apostle

311
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
 Peter.

312
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:35,760
 I've put a picture of it up on the screen.

313
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,600
 This is the actual beach where Jesus restored Peter.

314
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,800
 Now in Peter's original commission, Jesus said, "Follow me and I will make you fishers

315
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,800
 of men."

316
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
 Remember that?

317
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
 Matthew 4.19.

318
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,840
 In other words, follow me because I have a plan and a purpose for your lives.

319
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,720
 But Peter, of course, betrayed Jesus three times on the night before his death.

320
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,080
 He had messed up.

321
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,440
 He was a failure.

322
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,520
 And so he returned to his old gig.

323
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,720
 He ignored his new commission.

324
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,000
 He'd gone fishing.

325
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,300
 Oh yes, but fishing for fish again.

326
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:30,800
 I think Peter knew he was wearing the identity of three-time betrayer on his chest.

327
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:37,080
 He did not believe a three-time betrayer had any place in the plans and purposes of Jesus

328
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
 anymore.

329
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,600
 Have you ever been in a similar place?

330
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,520
 You've denied Jesus, so now you feel cloaked in shame.

331
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:59,360
 Or you've ignored Jesus, forgotten Jesus, and now you're back to your old way of life.

332
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,480
 You've sinned.

333
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,560
 You've given the enemy a seat at your table.

334
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,880
 When that happens, you go to a familiar place.

335
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,880
 Even though that familiar place isn't part of Jesus' call on your life, to a place you

336
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,800
 know and know only too well.

337
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:29,440
 You go to a place that's easy to go to, but seldom beneficial.

338
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:37,440
 It may not be a place of debauchery or gross sin, but merely a place where you think you

339
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,120
 can do life without God.

340
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:48,800
 It is perhaps the grossest sin of all.

341
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,640
 In a place like this, it's hard to believe you can ever be restored.

342
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:02,480
 But as the day broke, there was some good news.

343
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,460
 Day broke, Jesus stood on the shore.

344
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,640
 He asked the disciples if they'd caught any fish.

345
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,000
 He already knew the answer.

346
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,600
 He asked them to throw their nets on the other side of the boat.

347
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,960
 Man, we tried that already.

348
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,600
 We're experienced fishermen, you know.

349
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:30,000
 The difference was because Jesus was behind the declaration.

350
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:38,380
 Fortunately, Peter and the other disciples followed Jesus' voice and their nets became

351
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
 instantly full.

352
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,840
 We caught 153 fish.

353
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,760
 Peter got so excited, he jumped into the sea and swam to land to see if it really was Jesus.

354
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,480
 And there's me jumping into the sea.

355
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,160
 Boom.

356
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:00,680
 There's me jumping into the sea.

357
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:07,320
 There is me jumping into the sea.

358
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:30,080
 Can I have the next slide, please?

359
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,400
 I need to tell you why you're looking at this amazing picture.

360
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,600
 That's Kathy, by the way.

361
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:45,720
 How Jesus restored Peter is how Jesus restores us today.

362
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:54,240
 I mean, he would have been justified in saying, "Hey, Peter, I heard you denied me three times.

363
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,120
 Are you for real?

364
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,120
 I hate to be a told you so, but I told you so.

365
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,360
 Why did you let me down at the most critical point of my mission?

366
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,480
 Are you even sorry?

367
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,480
 You're worthless.

368
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,480
 You're a hypocrite.

369
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,480
 Get out of here."

370
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,600
 No, Jesus did not say that to Peter.

371
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,160
 And he doesn't say anything like that to you and me.

372
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,680
 He simply said to Peter, "Come and have breakfast.

373
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,280
 Come close to me.

374
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,640
 Get some warm baked bread.

375
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,560
 Here's barbecued fish fresh off the grill.

376
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,000
 I'll bet you're tired and wet.

377
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,960
 Come by this warm fire.

378
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:55,120
 Sit and rest a while and dry your damp clothes."

379
00:36:55,120 --> 00:37:01,000
 What do you think Jesus will say to you when he takes you for breakfast?

380
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,640
 Do you think it will be words of accusation?

381
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,480
 Certainly the enemy would like to put that into our minds.

382
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,880
 Do you imagine that Jesus would say to you, "You're done for, finished."

383
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:23,280
 Yet Romans chapter eight says, "Yet there is therefore no condemnation for those who

384
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,720
 are in Christ Jesus."

385
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,120
 No condemnation.

386
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:33,920
 Jesus gave us such a perfect picture of that verse in his dealings with Peter.

387
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:39,240
 And Jesus offers us similar kindness.

388
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,120
 After the meal, Jesus had some more kind words for Peter.

389
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,360
 Jesus asked one question in three different ways.

390
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,880
 Essentially, he said to Peter, "Do you love me?

391
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,080
 Do you love me more than these boats and nets and fish and these things you've given your

392
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:58,400
 life to but I called you away from?"

393
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:11,040
 When Peter affirmed his love for the Lord Jesus, Jesus replied, "Feed my sheep."

394
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:18,320
 Jesus did more for Peter and more for us than we can imagine.

395
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,400
 Jesus was telling Peter he wasn't finished.

396
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:30,000
 Peter was gonna be the rock on which the mission of God will be established and carried forward.

397
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,040
 It said that his identity was not gonna be a denier of Jesus.

398
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,620
 He would not have D sketched on his shirt.

399
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,680
 He would be the hero of faith and a legend in the church.

400
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,720
 Peter will one day very soon preach the gospel and the power of the Holy Spirit and 3000

401
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,000
 people will be saved that day.

402
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,440
 Jesus never focused on Peter's failure.

403
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,440
 He focused on the restoration.

404
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,080
 Grace removed Peter's guilt.

405
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,040
 Grace removed Peter's shame.

406
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,080
 Peter's identity was no longer wrapped up in the denial.

407
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,640
 Yes, he'd failed.

408
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,000
 He failed big time but his life wasn't a failure.

409
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,160
 His life was no longer marked by shame.

410
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:32,200
 Grace redefined Peter as a friend and a family member of the God Almighty.

411
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:38,920
 And that's what the grace of God does for you and me too.

412
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:48,560
 As I draw this to a close, one of my favorite verses in the whole Bible, Psalm 34, 5 says,

413
00:39:48,560 --> 00:40:00,480
 "Those who look to him are radiant and their faces shall never be ashamed."

414
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,040
 Jesus says, "You are not damaged goods.

415
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,680
 You are a child of the Almighty God, an heir to the King of the universe."

416
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:17,920
 When Jesus invites you to breakfast on the beach, He simply asks if you love Him.

417
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:25,240
 If the answer is yes, Jesus proceeds with the restoration.

418
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,720
 Now the enemy might wanna twist it.

419
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,040
 He might wanna keep sitting at your table.

420
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:36,200
 He wants you to listen to his voice looking away.

421
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:43,780
 But the first in Psalms encourages us to look to the Lord and promises us, you will be radiant.

422
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,080
 This is a powerful image and the opposite of shame.

423
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,820
 If you are looking to the Lord, you are radiant.

424
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,040
 Your face is reflecting the light and love of Christ.

425
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,240
 Look, I know, I know it can be hard to forgive yourself.

426
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,840
 I get it.

427
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:14,140
 Your new identity comes from realizing that Jesus forgives you.

428
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,100
 He says, "Those who look to him are radiant, their faces shall never be ashamed."

429
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,220
 He calls you son.

430
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,540
 He calls you daughter.

431
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:29,340
 Jesus says, "You are forgiven."

432
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,860
 Do you agree with Him?

433
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:45,520
 As the band comes back, could we all stand?

434
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,660
 I believe we've got some business to do tonight.

435
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,300
 Don't worry about what you're gonna have for dinner.

436
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,580
 You can worry about the 15 minutes.

437
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,900
 We're gonna pray, we're gonna pray for restoration.

438
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:11,060
 We're gonna receive the freedom that he has for us.

439
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,980
 If you're in the overflow room or even if you're watching at home, you might want to

440
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,300
 stand with us as well.

441
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,540
 Because I'm gonna ask you to repeat a prayer after me.

442
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,780
 Why I'm gonna ask you to do this is actually a confession of your lips.

443
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,780
 It's the first thing there.

444
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:32,180
 The first thing we're gonna do is repent.

445
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,700
 Then we're gonna renounce.

446
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,380
 And thirdly, we're gonna break.

447
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:50,060
 So repeat after me, "Father God, I repent of doubting your love for me.

448
00:42:50,060 --> 00:43:00,900
 I also repent of believing that you have really forgiven me and that the blood of Jesus has

449
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:14,460
 cleansed me from all of the sin, all of the guilt, and all of the shame of my past.

450
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:24,780
 Heavenly God, I repent and listening and agreeing with the voice of the accuser, telling me

451
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:34,100
 that I'm an evil person, that I'm dirty, and that I'm unworthy to come and receive your

452
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,260
 love.

453
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:46,740
 Here today, I renounce guilt, false guilt, and shame.

454
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:56,940
 I renounce condemnation, self-condemnation, and all sense of unworthiness.

455
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:10,780
 I renounce every spirit assigned to work against me with guilt, shame, and condemnation.

456
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:21,540
 I renounce what they have done to keep me from becoming the person God created me to

457
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,540
 be."

458
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:26,420
 We're gonna break these now.

459
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:38,940
 I break all agreements I have made with the lying voices of guilt, shame, and condemnation.

460
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:46,500
 I break all word curses I have spoken about myself.

461
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:57,980
 I break all soul ties and all generational ties that would bind me in any way to past

462
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:03,220
 guilt, shame, or condemnation.

463
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:13,420
 I break every vow, covenant, or agreement, and all word curses that would give these

464
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:21,260
 spirits any power or influence in my life.

465
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:33,740
 All spirits of guilt, shame, and condemnation, I break your power over me in the mighty name

466
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,620
 of Jesus.

467
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:50,740
 Father God, I choose to open my heart to receive your unconditional love, your grace and forgiveness,

468
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:59,380
 and a full release from all guilt and shame in my life.

469
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:13,260
 And by your grace, I also choose to forgive myself in Jesus' name.

470
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,980
 I believe that God has done something in us tonight.

471
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:26,260
 We've identified these major tools of the enemy in guilt, shame, and condemnation.

472
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:32,780
 And we've broken their power in the name of Jesus.

473
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,500
 I'm going to ask you to do one thing now.

474
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,260
 I'm going to ask you to lift your head.

475
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,860
 You don't need to stoop anymore.

476
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,860
 Lift your head.

477
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:43,860
 Lift your head.

478
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:49,620
 And I'm going to read these words again over you.

479
00:46:49,620 --> 00:47:00,740
 Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed.

480
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,140
 Let's declare this as we sing this song, "My Chains Are Gone."

481
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:09,940
 The price is paid.

482
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,220
 Amazing grace.

483
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,180
 Let's sing this together as a church.

484
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:14,540
 Amen.

485
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:16,540
