[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   Isaiah 9 verse 6 has been a favorite verse of mine for many years.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.400]   I think it goes back to when I was in a youth group as a child and I remember, I can't remember
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.680]   the context of this play I was in, but I can remember coming out, holding a baby, well
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.440]   it wasn't a baby, it was a plastic baby, you know what I mean, a drama baby, holding it
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:38.320]   above my head and quoting Isaiah 9 verse 6.
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.980]   When the subjects came out, the wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting father,
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.040]   I grabbed everlasting father.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.760]   And I wondered why I grabbed it and then about two or three weeks ago I heard Ken's testimony
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.360]   for the first time.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:06.960]   How his father had been such an important part of his journey, but how his father had
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.640]   died.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.480]   My own father died when I was a teenager, I was 17 when my father died.
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.200]   And I remember the day he passed away, he called me in and his last words to me were
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.320]   these, "Son, take care of your mother."
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:40.960]   And you know, a few years ago I felt very much of the same call that God the father
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:52.280]   was calling me to his side and saying to me quite specifically, "Son, take care of my
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.920]   church."
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:03.160]   And I really sense that is a call that's upon me and upon Sandra and we've seen this manifest
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:11.320]   in the fact that we have children all over the place and that we're father and mother
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.160]   to so many.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:26.360]   And yet tonight I'm going to look at something that might be described as puzzling.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.800]   But before we start, I need your help.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.840]   I'm going to post a question and I want you to answer in the chat line.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.420]   It's not difficult.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:49.400]   It's actually this, what one word do you associate with the word father?
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.480]   Can you perhaps give us some answers there?
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:59.240]   What one word, when you hear the word father, what is the one word that you associate with
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.240]   it?
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.760]   We'll just wait for you for a moment.
[00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:18.840]   Authority, loving, provider, protector, obey, security, caring, protection again.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   Unpredictable, that's a good one.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840]   Love from James.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.840]   Thank you, James.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.440]   Strength, unconditional love, provision.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.440]   My goodness, we're doing well here.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.320]   Upright, says Gordon.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.040]   Wow.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.880]   Thank you so much for that.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.000]   I want to go back to the verse.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.880]   Incredible, wonderful.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.240]   I want to go back to the verse that we are looking at tonight and read it to you again.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.360]   I think we've sung it so many times already this evening.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:07.080]   For unto us, unto us a child is born.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:18.720]   Unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:31.760]   be called wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting father, prince of peace.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.680]   I want to put this in context.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:43.360]   In context, this verse is proclaiming the redemption of Israel and the activities, the
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:53.240]   titles, the blessings of the Messiah who is to rule the earth and usher in a reign of
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.320]   blessing and peace that will have no end.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.760]   Can I repeat?
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.240]   No end.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:12.640]   And one of his titles is everlasting father.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:20.760]   Like the name mighty God that Johnny spoke about last week for centuries, this name everlasting
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.680]   father was shrouded in mystery.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.400]   I mean, what mortal could have this title?
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.120]   Jesus had arms, legs, eyebrows.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.880]   He screamed in a manger and by the way, I don't believe that line when they said the
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.680]   baby Jesus no crying he makes.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.360]   I'm sure he screamed in the manger.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.920]   But there is a dilemma here.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:13.120]   In Isaiah 9, 6, the Messiah is described both as a son unto us a son is given and a father.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.320]   His name shall be called everlasting father.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:27.600]   Is he a son or is he a father?
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.320]   And that gives us a bit of a dilemma when we look at the Trinity.
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.360]   Father, son and Holy Spirit.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:44.640]   And the first thing I want to say is that this verse has nothing, nothing to do with
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:53.680]   the precious Trinity relationship of father, son and Holy Spirit.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:03.560]   This verse we know speaks of looks towards Jesus.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.760]   Now we know he was a son.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.840]   We've been singing about it.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.140]   We'll be celebrating his birth in six days time.
[00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.480]   We have the Christmas season.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:25.200]   But we also know that he was crucified when he was around 33.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:31.360]   He never married and was never a father.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   And so what I want to do is unravel this.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:44.620]   I want to attempt to cover three things.
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.860]   And I'm going to ask three questions.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:57.660]   Number one, what is the meaning of the name everlasting father?
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:08.880]   Number two, is there any evidence that Jesus Christ is the everlasting father?
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:19.080]   And thirdly, what is the importance of the name everlasting father to believers today?
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:25.280]   And I'm going to take those one at a time.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:32.340]   And what I want to ask firstly is what is the meaning of the name everlasting father?
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:39.860]   And the first thing I want to say, it is a name, yes.
[00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:50.060]   But it is also an expression of huge symbolic significance.
[00:08:50.060 --> 00:09:00.020]   And what I mean by this is the most common symbolic use of the word, the Hebrew word
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:11.260]   Abiyad, which is translated father, is that the Messiah is an eternal father.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:24.620]   Meaning that he became a child in time through his birth, but he is the father and possessor
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.700]   of eternity.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:35.620]   And this reveals several aspects of his character.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.460]   And I'm going to use a number of scripture verses.
[00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.100]   I want to give thanks to Al Daily Bread for some ideas here.
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:48.340]   And if you haven't been reading it, this has been actually the best preparation for Christmas,
[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.940]   the best devotion I've ever come across.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:57.180]   Thank you, Al Daily Bread, one of KFC's partners.
[00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:03.580]   And the first thing, the first aspect of his character that it reveals is this, is that
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:11.460]   he inhabits and possesses eternity.
[00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:21.900]   In Hong Kong apartments, we have people who own them, landlords, and people who rent them.
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:27.220]   Tenants and rents are very high.
[00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:37.620]   But when it comes to eternity, Jesus is both the owner, it is his, his name is on the deed,
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:42.220]   and he also is the one who lives in it.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:50.300]   When it comes to eternity, we can regard him as an owner-occupier, a landlord-tenant.
[00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.660]   Let's see it in this scripture.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:11:07.660]   "For thus says the one who is high and lifted up, who inhabits eternity, whose name is holy,
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:18.140]   I dwell, I live in the high and holy place, and also with him who is of a contrite and
[00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:27.780]   lowly spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite."
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.180]   So that's number one.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:35.940]   Number two, his name is eternal.
[00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:48.260]   The name Jesus is derived from the Hebrew name Yeshua, which means to deliver, to rescue.
[00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:52.060]   Jesus has delivered his people.
[00:11:52.060 --> 00:12:00.180]   Jesus is delivering and will forever be the deliverer, the rescuer.
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:07.940]   The Psalmist tells us, "May his name endure forever.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:17.380]   May it continue as long as the sun, and all men shall be blessed in him.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:23.580]   All nations will call him blessed."
[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:29.060]   Number three, he is the eternal provider.
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:35.020]   Jesus not only delivers and rescues, he provides.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:41.820]   We can take heart whatever our needs are, he will always provide.
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.660]   Always.
[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:50.100]   At the very end of the Bible, at the end of Revelation, we read this, "He said to me,
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.220]   'It is done.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:57.140]   I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:04.660]   To the thirsty, I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.260]   Those who are victorious will inherit all of this.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:15.420]   I will be their God, and he will be my son.'"
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:28.180]   And lastly, he is eternal in all that he is and all that he does.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:36.420]   This implies two crucial truths that will claim for God's Messiah, both in the Old and
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.680]   the New Testaments.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.420]   Number one, he is pre-existent.
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.700]   Think about this for a moment.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:52.700]   Before the mountains were born, before the mountains were born, or you brought forth
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:14:00.540]   the whole world, from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:07.300]   And not only is he pre-existent, he is self-existent.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:18.340]   In Exodus 3, God calls himself, "I Am."
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:23.100]   This name defines who God is.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:30.500]   He is totally independent of his creation, and he is totally independent of time.
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:41.100]   He is the God who is Alpha and Omega, the God of the eternal present tense.
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:47.020]   He is completely self-dependent.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:58.340]   Now you say this is all very well, but is there any evidence that Jesus Christ is the
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.020]   everlasting Father?
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:07.460]   And for this, I want to take you, if we can have the next slide, please, to the Gospel
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.460]   of John.
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:25.540]   In John 8, a fascinating dialogue occurs between Jesus and his religious antagonist, the Pharisees.
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:31.700]   Jesus called God his Father.
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.660]   The Pharisees called Abraham their father.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:43.500]   And Jesus said that if Abraham were their father, they would do the works of Abraham.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:49.980]   And they responded, we've got to get back at this, at least they were not born of sexual
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:56.180]   sin, implying that Mary had been sexually active before marriage, which of course is
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:57.180]   not true.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:07.180]   And then they matched Jesus' claim by saying they all have one Father, God.
[00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:16.180]   And we read this, Jesus said to them, "If God were your father, you would love me.
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.900]   But I have come here from God.
[00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:27.220]   I have not come of my own, but God sent me.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.220]   Why do you not understand my speech?
[00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:36.980]   Because you are not able to listen to my word.
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:45.740]   You are of your father, the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires."
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:56.860]   The Pharisees were making their claim to Abraham and the God of Abraham, but Jesus didn't back
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.420]   down.
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:08.540]   Instead, he clarified that their link to Abraham was merely physical.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:27.300]   Then he makes the most amazing statement of all, wait for it, "Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.580]   Just think about what he said.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:39.060]   God had introduced himself to Moses in the burning bush.
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.580]   His name was I am.
[00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:53.100]   And Jesus said to the Pharisees before Abraham's time, "I was God, I am."
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:58.200]   Now in the mind of the Pharisees, he'd gone too far.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:04.940]   They recognized by such a claim, he was making himself equal with God.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.500]   The I am of the burning bush in Exodus 3.
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:17.020]   This claim so infuriated them that they picked up their stones to kill him.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:24.640]   In retrospect, we can see more here than the Pharisees' rage.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:34.440]   We also see the one, the one who by his miraculous life, death, and resurrection had shown the
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:44.440]   right to the name that Isaiah's prophecy had declared 700 years before his birth.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.900]   My friends, make no mistake.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:55.400]   Those who reject the eternality of Christ also reject his deity.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.300]   The two are inseparable.
[00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:05.480]   If Jesus is not eternal, he is not God and vice versa.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:16.220]   Isaiah was saying that when Messiah came, he would be the physical embodiment of the
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.300]   everlasting father.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:31.140]   The ability of Christ, of Jesus Christ to be a timeless source of fatherly protection
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:36.100]   and provision, which came up earlier when I asked you to describe what a father was.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.180]   You talked about provision, you talked about protection.
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:45.460]   Is claimed a number of ways in the New Testament.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:53.140]   Firstly, his character is described as eternally consistent and unchanging.
[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:59.500]   Jesus Christ is the same today, yesterday, and forever.
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:08.980]   Secondly, his New Testament title, Alpha and Omega, uses the first alpha and the last omega
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:16.160]   letters of the Greek alphabet to symbolize that Christ is before everything and will
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.340]   surpass everything.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:27.260]   Also John the Baptist, whose birth preceded Jesus, still recognized the eternality of
[00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:35.620]   Christ when he said, "This is he of whom I have said, 'After me comes a man who is
[00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:43.580]   preferred before me or has surpassed me because he was before me.'"
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:48.660]   Church, KFCI.
[00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:54.900]   He is the eternal one.
[00:20:54.900 --> 00:21:05.820]   And lastly, what is the importance of the name everlasting father to believers today?
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:09.820]   How does it affect all of us on this Zoom call?
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:12.620]   You and me.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:24.120]   Well, the self-existence of Christ means that he will not leave us as all our earthly fathers
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.580]   eventually must.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.780]   You've heard Ken's story.
[00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:32.380]   You've heard my story.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:39.460]   Sadly, our fathers left us.
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:53.100]   This amongst many other facts makes the incarnation, the Christmas story, an amazing thing.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:22:01.460]   The eternal God who took upon himself the limitations of a human body so that he could
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:07.840]   bring us into an everlasting relationship with himself.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.200]   My friends, that's so important.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.820]   I want to say it again.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:20.120]   The incarnation, the Christmas story is a story of an eternal God who took upon himself
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:29.760]   the limitations of a human body so that he could bring us into an everlasting relationship
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.920]   with himself.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:43.800]   Even though this world is marked with unfairness, inequity, suffering, those who believe in
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:55.560]   God's Messiah are in the hands of an eternal father and provider.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:03.080]   As the author to the book of Hebrews says this, "Let your conduct be without covetousness.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:09.440]   Be content with things, such things as you have.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:15.960]   For he himself has said, 'Never will I leave you.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.160]   Never will I forsake you.'"
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:23.200]   Look at those words, "Never."
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.240]   Never will I leave you.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.920]   Never will I forsake you.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:35.760]   This is the father who will never leave us.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.140]   He maintains an eternal presence.
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:44.200]   He gives us life that is eternal.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:53.480]   He graciously provides for those who realize that eternal values are what really counts.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:24:01.600]   Matthew 6:33, I've put it there, says, "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness,
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.480]   and all these things will be given to you as well."
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:19.600]   This year, 2020, is the year when many of the world's values have been stripped away.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:30.760]   Those people who have bought their life upon money, power, title, possessions, it's all
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.600]   been stripped away.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:42.440]   Can I just say, if he were only God for the length of our lifetime on earth, he would
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:48.240]   still deserve our reverence and trust.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:57.800]   But as the God of eternity, he is worthy of our unending devotion and our most careful
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.960]   attention.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:08.560]   Can I just finish with a challenge?
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:22.240]   May we take the time this Christmas to consider offering ourselves completely to Christ.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:32.480]   Christ, who was the timeless one, who invaded time to rescue us from sin and self.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:46.960]   The everlasting father who has given his life that we might have eternal peace with God
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.560]   and with one another.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:26:04.680]   Just pause for a moment and maybe use this time of reflection to offer yourself to Christ
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   completely.
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:20.320]   For those of us who are believers, where we maybe have relied upon our job, our parents,
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:32.440]   our money, our possessions, it's a good time for us just to release that and say, everlasting
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:41.440]   father, would you be completely Lord of my life?
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:47.040]   And if you haven't made that decision yet to follow him, maybe you're watching on YouTube.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.800]   I don't know, maybe you got on the link by accident.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.840]   I don't think it's an accident.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.200]   Can I just challenge you?
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:06.960]   Jesus Christ, I recognize I've done things wrong in my life, things that the Bible calls
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.200]   sin.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:19.600]   I believe that you are the eternal father who came to earth to die for my sins.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.080]   I offer you my life.
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:35.040]   Lord you take my life this Christmas and use it for your glory.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   In Jesus name.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.400]   Amen.
[00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:49.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
