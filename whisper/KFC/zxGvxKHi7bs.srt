00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 (Applause)

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Thank you, thank you.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Alright, so as some of you may have suspected,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 I'm not actually from Hong Kong.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Originally, I'm from Australia,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 where I got this beautiful accent from.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Now, before I came to Hong Kong, I knew some things about it.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Subtropical place, in a changeover,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 big financial hub, great food.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 I didn't know much, but I knew some things.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 As I came here, I started to see the skyscrapers with my own eyes.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I tasted the dim sum, I rode the ferry.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 I started to clock some experience with the city.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 And then, over time, I have my own things that I love about Hong Kong.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 My favourite restaurants, my favourite places to go.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 I have my own frustrations.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I get to know some of the people and the culture.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I went through some pretty significant events with Hong Kong.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Now, I went through this city with sheer joy

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 and also various uncertainties.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Now, I still don't know Hong Kong fully.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 I don't even speak Guangdong dialect.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 But you can see the difference from when I first came,

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 where I kind of knew some things about the city,

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 to now where I'm really kind of knowing the city.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I feel the heartbeat.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I understand it a bit.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I understand the one and a half different seasons here.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 The more I know it, the easier it becomes home.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Now, this is the same as how we want to grow with knowing God.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 To move on the journey from knowing about God

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 to knowing Him deeply.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 And to do this, we're going to start with Psalm 23,

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 the Psalm that is at the core of this book,

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 "Don't give the enemy a seat at your table."

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 He makes me lie down in green pastures.

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 He leads me beside still waters.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 He restores my soul.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 He leads me on paths of righteousness for His name's sake.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I will fear no evil, for you are with me.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Now, I don't know about you, but as we read,

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 "You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies,"

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 it's easy to get a little envious of this,

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 even though it's true for us.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 But with His enemies around Him, David is focused on God.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 He is focused on Your goodness, and love will follow me.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And look at how David describes God earlier in Psalm 23.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 "He restores my soul. He leads me beside still waters.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I will fear no evil, for you are with me."

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Now, this about our God is as true for you as it is for me as it was for David.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 So then why so often, when God is with us in the presence of our enemies,

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 do we want to focus on our enemies rather than on God?

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Now, the key difference is this.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Often when I'm reciting Psalm 23 to myself,

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I'm simply reminding myself of things I know about God.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Now, this is a good thing to do.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 But David didn't just know these things about God,

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 but he is listing out his experience with God.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 As Pastor John pointed out earlier in this series,

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 this Psalm wasn't some nice lullaby.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 It was written from a full life with God,

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 a full life of mountains and valleys with God.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Not just mountains and valleys, mountains and valleys with God.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Now, David is declaring these things from a place of knowing God,

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 from walking with Him, from a life of having been open and vulnerable with Him,

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 from experiencing and understanding His grace and forgiveness.

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 It is through all this that even in the presence of the enemies,

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 he is focused on God.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Now, last year we had Pastor Francis Chan come and speak to us,

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 and one of the things he urged was that we can look at the menu,

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 we can look and see that God is good,

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 but we don't want to be just stuck looking at the menu.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 We want to do as David does, says in Psalm 34, 8.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 We want to taste and see that the Lord is good.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 We want to experience that God is good, that He is with us.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 This is where David wrote this Psalm from.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 And to unpack one reason why this is so important,

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 when God is right before us in the presence of our enemies,

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 the more we know Him, the easier it is for us to trust Him.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 But wait, God's trustworthiness isn't dependent on whether we know Him or not.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 So let's consider the statement this way.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 The less we know Him, the more hesitant we are to place our trust in Him,

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 the more easily we will place our trust elsewhere.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Let me say that again.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 The less we know Him, the more hesitant we will be to place our trust in Him,

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 the more easily we will place our trust elsewhere.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 The easier it is for then us to say,

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 "Hmm, maybe we need to pull up some other seats at this table.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 Maybe just for safekeeping.

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Maybe I'll look somewhere else for comfort, peace, acceptance, direction, forgiveness."

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Now, let me give you an example from my own experience.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 When I was younger, I really felt God telling me that I needed to stop getting drunk.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 I was a Christian then, and I knew this was from God,

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 and I could understand that this was what I needed to do, but I didn't want to.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 How could I have a better life with whatever God had planned

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 than if I just did what I wanted to do?

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 I didn't know how I could fit in and make friends.

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 I had no idea how God was going to lead me, so it was hard and full of failure.

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 It was easier for me to trust what I already knew.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 While I knew God was speaking to me, it was so hard to be focused on Him,

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 to follow Him.

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 I could understand His way would be better,

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 but there was comfort and familiarity in my own way.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 And it's important to mention that it is hard for us to trust what we don't know.

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 It's also important to mention that God is at our table.

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 How we react to Him being there doesn't change who He is,

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 it just changes how we react to Him.

116
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Whether or not we know Him deeply doesn't change that He is trustworthy.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 But if we are to be fixated on God so that we can more fully enjoy what He has for us,

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 and we don't give the enemy a seat at our table,

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 it is vital that we are getting to know this God who we are to trust and follow.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 So you may have also noticed that the title of this sermon is 'Staggered by the Mountain'.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 It is based on a moment in his book where Louis discovers that he really needs to go from

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 knowing about God to knowing God.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Now, my experience is a different experience and a different process,

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 but really a point in my life where I realised I need to go from knowing about God to knowing God.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 I realised I couldn't just take what God had said and do it on my own.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 I needed to walk with Him, go to Him in failure.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 I needed to accept His grace and forgiveness and walk alongside Him.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 I needed to taste and see that the Lord is good.

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 It was then I was more easily able to trust and follow Him.

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 Now, this doesn't guarantee us no problems or failures,

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 but we can know more deeply His grace, comfort and boldness that we see in Psalm 23.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 It then goes from something we recite to ourselves to remind us of God's goodness,

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 to one we declare as we experience that He is good.

134
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 We can go from, 'Valley of death, but God is with me, God is with me'

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 to 'I will fear no evil, for God is with me'.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 And as we know Him more deeply and since they fixated on Him,

137
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 we can come to know more deeply His goodness, grace, forgiveness and love.

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Now, maybe this gives us a sinking feeling like,

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 'Oh, I find it really hard to trust God. Do I really even know Him?'

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 But let me be clear, this is not a message of guilt about knowing God enough.

141
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 This is a message of excitement and encouragement.

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 It's actually amazing that we can get to know this star-breathing Creator of the Universe in this way,

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
 walking alongside in deep one-to-one relationship, just as David did.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And I'll let you in on a secret, we all need to work on this.

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 This is a process for all of us.

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Getting to know God in this way isn't overnight.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And some of us may find it harder than others.

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 And there may be some moments of rapid growth.

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 But even for David, this was a process.

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 We often think of David as bursting onto the scene

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 and taking down Goliath in this amazing act of faith.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 In 1 Samuel 16, we are first introduced to David and the next chapter, boom, down goes Goliath.

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 Amazing. What an act of faith. And it was.

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 But let's look at 1 Samuel 17 37.

155
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 "And David said, 'The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear

156
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.'

157
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 And Saul said to David, 'Go, and the Lord be with you.'"

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Before Goliath, David had been building up his trust in God for years

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 as he had seen Him working and protecting him.

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 His journey didn't start with this giant event that we all know.

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 So whether you're just exploring or new to faith or have been following God for years,

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 be encouraged that we can continue to know Him more deeply

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 and that this is a process for all of us.

164
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 So when He is with us in the presence of our enemies,

165
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 we don't just know that He is good, but we know that He is good.

166
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 We can trust Him enough to be fixated on Him wholly

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 and we don't give the enemy a seat at our table.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Okay, well, that's all exciting, but maybe sounds a little bit lofty.

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 So let's get practical.

170
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 How do we actually move along this process from knowing about God

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 to really knowing God and having deep relationship with Him?

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 Now, we need to learn about God, have community around Him,

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 and dialogue with Him.

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 So we need to learn about God, have community around God,

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 and work on our dialogue with God through praise, confession, and practicing trust.

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 So let's look at learning about God.

177
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 Now, you may be thinking, after this whole spiel

178
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 from going to knowing about God to knowing God,

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 is this guy actually just say that?

180
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 But this is not a contradictory statement.

181
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Part of the process of getting to know God is to be actively learning about Him.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 When I started dating Mel and she told me things about her

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 such as, "I was born in Canada," or, "I'm training in intensive care,"

184
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 my response wasn't to say, "That's irrelevant.

185
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 I'm trying to get to know you, not about you."

186
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 It's part of it.

187
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 As we get to know God deeply and personally,

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 this doesn't mean we stop learning about God and His character,

189
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 but it does mean we actually experience Him and know His character more deeply.

190
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 We need to be pursuing a deeper understanding of God and His character.

191
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 In his book, Louis Giglio lays out a great example of this.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 Let's look at Isaiah 6, 2-3.

193
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 We see six-winged angels called seraphim

194
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 that are covering their feet and faces crying out,

195
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty."

196
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 We can see this and see that God is holy.

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Already we have a truth about God.

198
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 He is holy, set apart, and sacred.

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 But we can go deeper.

200
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 These angelic beings are covering their faces and feet.

201
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 They're so in awe of God that they can't even look at Him

202
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 and they're covering feet in honour of Him.

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And they are crying out, "Holy, holy, holy."

204
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
 Now, why are they saying this three times?

205
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Surely once is enough, right?

206
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 As we see in Hebrew, when a word is repeated, it doubles the emphasis.

207
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 To see this repeated three times is actually extremely rare.

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 So we have these angelic beings so in awe of God,

209
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 crying out, not just to say He is holy,

210
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 but He is holy, times holy, times holy again.

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 He is holy, holy, holy.

212
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Now, this is just one example.

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 We're just scratching the surface.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 But the step of learning more about God and learning His character

215
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 is vital in knowing Him.

216
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 As we come to see and know more of His character,

217
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 we come to see who it is that we are to place our trust in.

218
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 So what does this mean for us practically?

219
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 This might simply mean for some of us that we need to read the Bible.

220
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 If this is a hard habit to build,

221
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 signing up to a reading plan on a Bible app can be a really, really helpful thing.

222
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 Now, this may mean we need to start actively memorising Scriptures,

223
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 writing them on our hearts.

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And it may mean we need to start looking at some of the commentaries,

225
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 getting deeper into what these texts are saying.

226
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 So let's look at having community around Him.

227
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 Now, I'm a guitarist.

228
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 A lot of what I have learnt has been through my own practice.

229
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 But the expertise and experience from other musicians

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 has been invaluable to my own growth.

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 In sharing my joy and knowledge of the instrument,

232
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 I strengthen what I know, sometimes through correction from others.

233
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 But I also learn from their knowledge and their experiences.

234
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 And through this, I gain a deeper understanding about the guitar.

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 I get to know my instrument better.

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
 Now, the same is true for when we come together with others

237
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 and walk with each other in our faith.

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 This is what God is doing in my life.

239
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 Wow, so great to hear how God has come through for you.

240
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 God is teaching me this right now.

241
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 We grow with God as we walk together with Him,

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 learning more about Him and witnessing Him working in each other's lives.

243
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 So practically, what can we do here?

244
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 Get that community.

245
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 Get involved in a clan if you're not already.

246
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Find a prayer partner, someone who you share with.

247
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 This is something I've been doing with a friend of mine in Australia

248
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 for a number of years, and it has honestly been one of the most

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 beneficial things in my journey with God.

250
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And lastly, in your family life,

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 prioritise and be intentional about walking with God with your family.

252
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 And so, the third is working on our dialogue with God.

253
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 As we do life with God, we get to know Him more.

254
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 So how does that look actually?

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 The truth is that it's us who needs to get to know Him more.

256
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 He already knows us deeply, but He desires for us to let Him in.

257
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 This Psalm 23 has brought so many, so much comfort in so many dark times.

258
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 So let's take a look at some other examples that David has left

259
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 through his Psalms with his dialogue with God.

260
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Now this is a three-parter.

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 We're going to look at praise, confession, and practising our trust in Him.

262
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 So let's look firstly at praising God.

263
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 What a surprise, the worship leader says we need to spend more time in praise.

264
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Which, yes, but through music is just one way we praise God.

265
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 We need to be giving Him thanks and acknowledging who He is.

266
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 Now let's take a look at Psalm 145, 1-4.

267
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 And this one we're going to read out together,

268
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 and really take note of the words as we speak them out.

269
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Let's go.

270
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 "I will exalt you, my God the King.

271
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 I will praise your name forever and ever.

272
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Every day I will praise you and extol your name forever and ever.

273
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise.

274
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 His greatness no one can fathom.

275
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 One generation commands your works to another.

276
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 They tell of your mighty acts."

277
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
 This actually goes on for 17 more verses.

278
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 I mean, can you imagine just sitting and writing out all of this praise to God?

279
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So why is this praise so important?

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 In his praise, David is acknowledging who God is.

281
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Look at verse 1.

282
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 "I will exalt you, my God the King."

283
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 Now remember, David was literally a king.

284
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 So as David puts God in this position, he's humbling himself and exalting God.

285
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 God is king.

286
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 With that praise coming out, we can't justify following our own way.

287
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 We can't justify clinging on to the enemies around us

288
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 as we proclaim that God is king.

289
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 Throughout the Psalm, David also speaks of his character.

290
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 "Greatness no one can fathom.

291
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 Mighty acts.

292
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Gracious and compassionate.

293
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 Slow to anger.

294
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Rich in love."

295
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Calling out his character, who he is.

296
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 We see this also reflected, actually, when Jesus teaches us how to pray in Matthew 6,

297
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 where he starts off with, "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name."

298
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 He's acknowledging who he's praying to, our Father in heaven, and praises him.

299
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 Hallowed, meaning wholly consecrated.

300
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 How could I not want to follow this God?

301
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 I want to know this God more and more.

302
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 I want to be in deep relationship with this God.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 I want to experience this God.

304
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 His ways are far greater than mine.

305
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 This is a God I can trust.

306
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 Here we see David actually praising upon the mountaintop.

307
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 We'll get to praising the valley, don't worry about that.

308
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 But like David, we also need to be praising God when we're on the mountaintops.

309
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 Because equally in those moments, we need to remember who is king, and that is God.

310
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 But David didn't just have these moments of praise boxed in their own little corner.

311
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Never to be seen amongst struggles and fear or repentance.

312
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 But this carried with him in all sorts of circumstances.

313
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 So practically, what are we going to do?

314
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 We need to make praise a regular part of our dialogue with God.

315
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 In our prayers to God, call out his character.

316
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 Praise him for who he is, prioritize it.

317
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Before we get to, "Please help me, and I'm struggling with this."

318
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 Praise him in the good times and the bad.

319
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 Get the relationship right with God, that he is good, that he is holy, and that he is king.

320
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 Starting with our prayer life.

321
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 Now my challenge to you is this.

322
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 Set aside some time in prayer to just praise him.

323
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 Speak of his goodness, call out his character.

324
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 But set aside some time where the only thing you do is praise him.

325
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Now the second is confession.

326
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Often when we fail, and what I know from experience, one of the prominent voices we hear is,

327
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 "Really? After that? After failing yet again?

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 You're going to come to God as if you're still some sort of Christian?

329
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I don't think he wants to hear from you."

330
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 Now let me be clear, this is a lie.

331
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Sometimes I would believe this lie, but what we must do is to ignore that lie and run to God.

332
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 When we fail, the only place to run to is God.

333
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 There's nothing you can do that will make God not want to hear from you.

334
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Again, there is nothing you can do that will make God not want to hear from you.

335
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Now let's look at some of Psalm 51,

336
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 which is a Psalm written by David after he was confronted by the prophet Nathan for adultery and murder.

337
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 "Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love,

338
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 according to your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.

339
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.

340
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 For I know my transgressions and my sin is always before me.

341
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight.

342
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 So you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge."

343
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 What David had done was horrible, yet even he is able to come to God, confess, receive forgiveness,

344
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and not be defined by these sins, but by who he is in God.

345
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And God already knew his sins.

346
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 He sent the prophet to tell David so that David was aware of them.

347
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 But by bringing his sins to God, David doesn't just know that God is forgiving,

348
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 but he knows God's forgiveness.

349
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 Look closely as David confesses.

350
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 "According to your unfailing love, according to your great compassion,

351
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 you are right in your verdict and justified when you judge."

352
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 As we go on to verse 14 and 15.

353
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 Through his confession, David is praising God, calling out his character.

354
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 In verse 14 and 15, we see that with God's forgiveness, David knows that he can praise God freely.

355
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 And notice what it's not.

356
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 "I'll praise you, but I'll still remember all my sins and that I'm horrible and that I'm inadequate."

357
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 It's not that at all.

358
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 This does not take David back to square one in his relationship with God.

359
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 Again, this doesn't take David back to square one in his relationship with God.

360
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 And this is why our praise is also so important here in confessing our sins.

361
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 If I hold myself as king, I still fall short.

362
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 I don't deserve God's forgiveness.

363
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 But if God is king and God is Lord, I am forgiven fully.

364
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 So what do we do?

365
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 We need to come in confession to God regularly.

366
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 It doesn't just have to be the big ones.

367
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 My challenge to you is to make this tangible.

368
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 Write them out or say them out loud.

369
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 They don't have to be adultery or murder.

370
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 We all need to have time of confession to God.

371
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 Praise Him as you do so and then receive and know His forgiveness.

372
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 And lastly, we need to practice trusting God.

373
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 Now this is a little bit like the chicken or the egg.

374
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 Well, does knowing God help me trust Him or does trusting God help me know Him?

375
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 And the answer is really both.

376
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 So now remember, whether or not we place our trust in God does not determine whether or not He is trustworthy.

377
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 He is.

378
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 But this is precisely why we want to know Him more.

379
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 That we may find it easier to place our trust in Him and walk with Him.

380
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 We all know what it's like to be in those places where we don't know what God is doing.

381
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Where we can't see what's ahead of us.

382
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 Now let's take a look at my personal favourite psalm, Psalm 13.

383
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 "How long, Lord, will you forget me forever?

384
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 How long will you hide your face from me?

385
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,000
 How long must I wrestle with my thoughts and day after day have sorrow in my heart?

386
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 How long will my enemy triumph over me?

387
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 Look on me and answer, Lord my God.

388
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 Give light to my eyes or I will sleep in death.

389
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 And my enemy will say, 'I have overcome him.'

390
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 My foes will rejoice when I fall.

391
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 But I trust in your unfailing love.

392
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 My heart rejoices in your salvation.

393
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 I will sing the Lord's praise for He has been good to me."

394
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 I still remember reading this for the first time and just being blown away by that shift in verse 5.

395
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 I mean, look at this brutal honesty in verses 1 to 4.

396
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 "Will you forget me forever?

397
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 How long will my enemy triumph over me?

398
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Give light to my eyes or I will sleep in death.

399
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 David is in a heavy place.

400
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 No one is envious of him in these four verses.

401
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
 But then within all of this, within all the frustration, uncertainty, feeling of abandonment,

402
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
 David commits to trust God.

403
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 He remembers that the Lord is good and commits to singing his praises.

404
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 He is vulnerable with God and he places his whole trust in Him."

405
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 Now, he isn't a backup plan, he is the whole plan.

406
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 And we see here praise again.

407
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 And I want you to consider going through this without praise.

408
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 Without "God is King", we think, "Is God King?

409
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 I know He's helped me before, but should I get this one?"

410
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 We need to remember God is King.

411
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 We need to be honest with Him in these times and trust and praise Him.

412
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 And this is consistent with David throughout his Psalms.

413
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 Somewhere he's literally being hunted by enemies.

414
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 But this doesn't only apply to us when we're literally being hunted.

415
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 Of Psalm 13, Charles Spurgeon says this,

416
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 "The Psalm cannot be referred to any special event or period in David's history.

417
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 All attempts to find it are birthplace are but guesses.

418
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 It was doubtless more than once the language of that of much tried man of God

419
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 and is intended to express the feelings of the people of God

420
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,000
 in those ever-returning trials which beset them."

421
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 This is for us in all times with that struggle,

422
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 whether it is in lust, anger, jealousy, greed, whatever it may be.

423
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 So what are we to do?

424
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 We need to be honest with God.

425
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 He already knows everything anyway.

426
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 Looking at David in Psalm 13,

427
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 look at David in Psalm 13.

428
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 With whatever is going on, we need to bring that to Him,

429
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 lay it down at His feet and trust Him to take it.

430
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 All of this takes practice.

431
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 Remember, this is a process for all of us.

432
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 And this may look like, "Lord, I'm struggling so much with this sin.

433
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Please take this burden for me."

434
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 Or, "Lord, I don't understand what is in front of me, but I trust in You.

435
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 Lord, I'm so stressed out with work, but I know You are in control.

436
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 I give these worries to You."

437
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 Again, this can really help to make this tangible.

438
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 Write them out or speak them out loud.

439
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 And we may never solve the chicken or the egg

440
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 with whether trusting or knowing God comes first, but that's okay

441
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 because what you will find is that as you step out and place trust in God more,

442
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 you will grow in knowing Him, and you will grow in experiencing Him,

443
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,000
 and you will see that He is for you, if a band can come up.

444
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 So I invite you on this process.

445
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 It's an exciting one, and it's one that we will all go through together,

446
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 of learning about God, having community around God,

447
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 and dialoguing with Him in praise, confession, and trust.

448
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 And then we can say with confidence, with joy, from a place of knowing God deeply,

449
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 "I praise Him for He is good. He has forgiven my sins.

450
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 I trust Him in the good times and the bad, and I have seen Him come through.

451
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Even when I am surrounded by all of my enemies,

452
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 He is the only one at my table, and I am fixated on Him.

453
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 I know God, and I trust Him."

454
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 Let me pray.

455
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 Lord, we thank You that You are a good God.

456
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 You are holy. You are worthy of praise.

457
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 You are worthy of all trust, Lord.

458
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 We thank You that we have this opportunity to walk in relationship

459
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 with this God who created the universe, Lord,

460
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 from the big, massive stars to every single little piece of sand on the shores.

461
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 And we thank You, Lord, that You are not a distant God,

462
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 but You are a God who reaches out to us, who comes to us.

463
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 Lord, You sent Your Son to die for us so we may be forgiven for our sins.

464
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
 We thank You that You are a God who wants to be in deep relationship with us.

465
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 And Lord, we cry out that we want to get to know You more, Lord.

466
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 We repent of the times that we struggle to trust You, Lord,

467
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 and we repent of the times when we would rather be doing something else.

468
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 But Lord, help us to just run to You in all circumstances

469
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 and get to know You more deeply, Lord.

470
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 And we ask that You'll be revealing Yourself to us more and more, Lord.

471
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 And we thank You that You are doing that, Lord.

472
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 Help us to recognise You working,

473
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 that we, in all circumstances, can know that You are with us,

474
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 that You are God,

475
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 and that You are the only one we need at our table.

476
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 We pray this in Your name. Amen.

477
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:35,000
