[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   (audio cuts out)
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.080]   Open up this word.
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:05.920]   Actually, what did you think
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.920]   you were coming here for this evening?
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.240]   Were you just kind of filling in a gap
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.240]   just before your reservation?
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.300]   Or is this just what you do,
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.740]   or your parents tell you to come, whatever it might be?
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.040]   I think when it comes to church, for me,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.820]   I'm getting this deeper and deeper sense
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.440]   of gratitude and reverence as to we're coming here
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.940]   because we're gathered here for Him.
[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:26.780]   We're gathered here for Him,
[00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.200]   and it's not even the speaker, the sermon,
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.560]   or the great songs that we just sang.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.080]   We're gathered here for Him.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.800]   And do you recognize that?
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.720]   Do you truly believe that?
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.560]   Is that what you're here for?
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.480]   Is that what you're hungry and thirsty for?
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.440]   This can't just be a routine thing,
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.440]   'cause if it's just a routine thing,
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.480]   and you're sitting here just because
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.720]   your dinner reservation is at 7.30,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.720]   then actually, I don't think it'll be any good for you.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.200]   But if you come expectant for the Holy Spirit
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.520]   to speak into your life,
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.440]   if you come being ready to be pointed to Jesus
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.880]   and to be embraced by the Father's love,
[00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.980]   I think then the Lord has something for you this evening.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.500]   Amen?
[00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.500]   And now we've been going through,
[00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.100]   you've been going through parables.
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.700]   I love parables, stories.
[00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.140]   Jesus was the greatest storyteller.
[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.980]   He chose to use stories because it's through the stories
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.540]   that we get to remember things.
[00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.140]   We watch movies for the same reason.
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.780]   We get to see these stories lived out,
[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.780]   and we kind of resonate with them,
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.220]   and we remembered them.
[00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.780]   And now we're like, "Oh, mustard seed.
[00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.420]   "It's about that."
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.020]   And then so Jesus uses stories,
[00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.920]   and He also uses it in them to help those
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.860]   who are really genuinely hungry for Him to get something.
[00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.060]   Because we all know what it's like to be spoon-fed
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.500]   and forced just morals and teachings and Bible verses,
[00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.940]   and you remember them just for that second,
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.340]   and then you don't live them out anymore
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.220]   because you've forgotten about them
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.260]   because you didn't go and get it yourself.
[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.580]   So Jesus tells stories
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.100]   so that the people who really want to,
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.940]   the people who have a soft and open heart,
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.460]   will then go, "Okay, Jesus, what is that about?"
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.500]   And of course, with stories,
[00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.300]   there's always a moral to the story, right?
[00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.660]   That you think, "Okay, so that's what it's about."
[00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.860]   And so that's why He tells stories,
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.080]   and I love this story here.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   It's only a short one.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.740]   I was gonna read it,
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.760]   but it looks like the video already read it for me.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.680]   This is an interesting one because Jesus starts the story,
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.920]   and actually, the one just before,
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.720]   the parable just before was talking about prayer.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.560]   He's saying, "You need to be persistent in your prayer.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.960]   "You can't just give up after one trial.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.260]   "You've gotta be persistent.
[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.080]   "It's gotta be a continual relationship."
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.400]   And then He does, He jumps into another parable,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.000]   another story, and He starts with saying,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.480]   "Two men walk into a bar."
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.960]   Well, this is not two men walk into a bar.
[00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.540]   He says, "Two men walk into a temple."
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.260]   And He basically contrasts two men,
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.420]   the Pharisee and the tax collector.
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.660]   Now, you and I know these two men fairly well,
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.220]   or at least what they represent.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.260]   And today, we're gonna go through this passage,
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.420]   and we're gonna see, actually,
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.460]   Jesus, what were you actually talking about here?
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.280]   And what I'm gonna do,
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.500]   because there's only really six verses,
[00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.740]   what I propose that we do is actually,
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.580]   we go through these six verses one by one.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.860]   As we go through them, we'll glean what we can
[00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.060]   from actually what is the bigger picture at play here?
[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.880]   What is Jesus talking about?
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.000]   What's the context in which He's talking from and to?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.520]   And after that, we'll draw out some practical applications
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.440]   just before we go and eat,
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.960]   so hopefully that we can remember them,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.560]   and actually really be able to apply them to our lives.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.600]   Is that good?
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.560]   So let's go.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.920]   Verse nine, He says this.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.840]   This is the word of the Lord.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.760]   "He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.320]   "that they were righteous,
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.400]   "and treated others with contempt."
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.240]   Thank you for putting that up.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.320]   I totally forgot to do this.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.240]   I need to remember.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.600]   Okay.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.100]   So, I love this, because in other passages,
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.620]   we have to first figure out what the context is.
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.700]   When Paul writes a passage, we've got to figure out,
[00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.820]   oh, what is the context?
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.700]   Who's he writing to?
[00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.400]   Why is he talking to them about this?
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.380]   But here, Luke goes out of his way
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.740]   to tell us who he's writing to.
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.620]   He makes it very clear.
[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.240]   He's saying, "He told this parable
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.180]   "to those who trusted in themselves
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.180]   "that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt."
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.140]   We're told the audience.
[00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.880]   We're told the context.
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.740]   What's the context?
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.300]   He's talking to people who are proud.
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.520]   We're talking to people who are prideful here,
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.360]   and you're looking at yourself,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.680]   okay, well, this is a good context,
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.720]   and of course, at the very end,
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.100]   if we just fast forward to the end,
[00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.820]   for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.500]   and the one who humbles himself will be exalted.
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.560]   So, we know this is about pride,
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.000]   but then, why don't we just say,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.620]   hey, guys, stop being prideful.
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.460]   That's it.
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.280]   End of sermon.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.120]   Let's pray.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.960]   Let's go.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.780]   There's more to it.
[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.020]   And so, as we look at this, we look at, okay,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.800]   people who trusted in themselves,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.340]   people who actually are, hmm, I think I can do it.
[00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.000]   I think I'm a good person.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.600]   If you keep pulling that all the way back to the end,
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.080]   this is Adam and Eve.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.320]   Adam and Eve didn't trust God.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.640]   That's the original sin, right?
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.840]   What is the original sin
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.240]   that has led to all these other sins?
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.440]   The original sin was,
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.100]   God, I'm not sure I can really trust you.
[00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.500]   I think I'm gonna trust myself.
[00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.120]   I think I'm gonna eat the apple.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.440]   I think I wanna know the difference
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.120]   between right and wrong myself.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.560]   I'm gonna trust in myself,
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.360]   and that they were righteous.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.680]   We don't use that word that much anymore, right?
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   What context do we use the word?
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.400]   When was the last time you heard the word righteous,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.980]   apart from the pulpit?
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.560]   The word righteous is often used in a negative tone.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.560]   That person is so self-righteous, so stuck up,
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.120]   so full of themselves.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.080]   But of course, that's not what the word righteous
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.000]   wants to bring out, the original meaning.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.680]   If you were to search it in the dictionary,
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.200]   it would be to be morally right, or just, to be good.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.040]   And so then you think, oh, well, actually, I'm good.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.200]   I'm a pretty good person.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.040]   But that's actually just half of it.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.480]   The problem here is, these guys that he's telling the story
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.320]   to trusted in themselves and thought they were righteous,
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.740]   so they were self-righteous,
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.460]   because they didn't really understand the true,
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.840]   the deeper spiritual meaning of the word righteous,
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.600]   which is, if you are to be righteous, as the Bible says it,
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.020]   it is to be right in the eyes of God.
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.440]   It is to be right in the eyes of God.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.540]   How does the Bible describe righteousness?
[00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.640]   It is an attribute of God.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.520]   It is perfection.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.960]   It is the holiness of God,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.480]   and you cannot attain it yourself.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.880]   The problem is, these people he's talking to
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.320]   have decided they can trust in themselves,
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.140]   that they can declare themselves good and perfect.
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.020]   What does that mean?
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.680]   They have severed their own connection between them and God.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.720]   They're like, God, we know you're up there,
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.680]   but actually, I think we're gonna not trust you.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.040]   I think we're gonna trust in ourselves, thank you very much.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.920]   And so they've completely severed that connection there.
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.880]   And then it carries on.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.920]   And then it says that they were righteous
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.120]   and treated others with contempt.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.760]   Pride, here's the danger of pride.
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.520]   And we're gonna be talking about pride this whole evening.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.200]   Not only does it sever your connection with God,
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.160]   it severs your connection with others.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.040]   You're treating others with contempt now.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.000]   They're looking down on other people.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.520]   So that's what he's talking about here.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.640]   And here's the problem.
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.840]   The whole Christian faith is about
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.040]   how do we love God and love our neighbor?
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.920]   The whole nature of grace is one of,
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.440]   it's almost, it's paradoxical.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.640]   How do you receive grace?
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.680]   You must be willing to give it.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.840]   Jesus, in his sermon, Matthew 5, said,
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.520]   "Blessed are those who are merciful,
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.480]   "for they shall receive mercy."
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.880]   So if you're not merciful, then you may not receive mercy.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.080]   When he teaches them how to pray,
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.400]   later in that sermon, he says, this is how you pray.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.000]   Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.320]   At the very end, he finishes, and we all ignore it
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.960]   because it's not as catchy as,
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.800]   yours is the kingdom forever and ever, amen.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.520]   It's forgive others as you have been given.
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.960]   'Cause if you don't forgive others, what will happen?
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.400]   Your Father in heaven won't forgive you.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.720]   Grace is paradoxical in its nature.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.640]   In order for us to receive it,
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.840]   we must be willing to give it.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.040]   So pride is dangerous.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.880]   That's what he's talking about.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.840]   That's the context.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.760]   Verse 10, he goes, this is his version of two men.
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.320]   Now we hear this, right?
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.600]   We hear the two men walk into a bar joke.
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.760]   Two men walk into a bar, an Englishman, an Irishman,
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.160]   and then goes the joke that really ridicules the Irishman
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.840]   because they're perceived as being not as smart,
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.720]   whatever it might be.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.840]   Or the two kinds of people memes that you see online.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.720]   There are two kinds of people in this world,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.480]   those who are married and those who are happy.
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:54.320]   Those kind of...
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.240]   Happily married, by the way, okay?
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.360]   It's just, that's a joke, okay?
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.240]   It's a joke.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.560]   Christina, it's a joke.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.400]   Okay.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.520]   There are two kinds of people in the world,
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.640]   those who love to talk and those who hate to listen.
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.600]   Okay, so Jesus is kind of, but we remember those things
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.280]   because they bring about a contrast between two people,
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.120]   right?
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.480]   And so he goes, "Hey, let me tell you something.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.640]   "Let me tell you a story."
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.680]   Two men walk into a temple to pray.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.600]   There's the Pharisee and there's the tax collector.
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.840]   We are familiar with these two people
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.000]   because we've heard about them.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.720]   If you've been in church for a certain amount of time,
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.400]   you will know that these two people,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.600]   they represent certain things.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.920]   The tax collector is a sinner.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.080]   He betrayed his people to get more money.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.320]   He worked for the enemy to collect money
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.720]   and to take a lot for himself.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.920]   So we know the tax collector is not a good man.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.680]   The Pharisee, we also know is not a good man.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.360]   There's songs about not being a Pharisee
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.720]   and not being a Sadducee.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.720]   So we know that the Pharisees are a bunch of stuck up people
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.720]   in the church that actually Jesus
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.520]   was very much pushing against.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.400]   But here's the thing.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.960]   When Jesus was telling this parable,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.080]   the listener at the time, the readers at the time,
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.920]   may not have thought that
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.880]   because they don't have the benefit of us
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.400]   having studied the gospels for all these years.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.520]   So in some ways, we need to understand
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.320]   what they were thinking when Jesus was telling the story,
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.720]   'cause then we can understand
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   why Jesus was telling the story to them like this.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.000]   Does that make sense?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.120]   So he says, "Two men walk into a temple to pray,
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.600]   "a Pharisee and a tax collector."
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.320]   We know both are bad guys.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.800]   We know both are fall short.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   But for the people listening,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.560]   they would have been like, "Ah, the tax collector.
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.320]   "Oh, bad guy, we hate tax collectors.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:37.400]   "A Pharisee, oh, influential guy,
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.280]   "rich guy, disciplined guy, knows his scripture well,
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.280]   "keeps the law, has a lot of power, looking up to him."
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:47.840]   That's what a Pharisee would have been perceived.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.800]   I don't know, what's the modern day?
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.600]   Two men walk in, if I start telling you a joke of some sort,
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.080]   and it's two men walk into a church,
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.840]   it's a pastor and a, what's an occupation
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.720]   that doesn't offend people if I say it?
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.440]   Oh, that's... (audience laughing)
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.280]   Two men walk into a church,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.600]   a pastor and a used car salesman.
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.600]   Like, sorry, or insurance salesman or banker.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.320]   I'm only saying that 'cause John used to be one.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   You get what I mean?
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.680]   So straight away, if you're sat there,
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.320]   you're like, "Okay, two men walk into a church,
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.920]   "a pastor and a used car salesman."
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.760]   You go, "Oh, please don't be offended, used car salesman.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.880]   "I love you, though I do not trust you, absolutely."
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.600]   You straight away think,
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.680]   "Okay, I think I know where he's going with this, right?"
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.880]   And so that's what these people are thinking.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.280]   "Okay, he's trying to show us something
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.640]   "about the tax collector that we need to learn,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.320]   "because surely a Pharisee is a very good person."
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.680]   And he says, "These two people go in and they pray."
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.960]   And then it carries on.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.940]   I am terrible, terrible with the slides.
[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:45.780]   Sorry, by the way.
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.680]   Thank you very much for paying attention more than I am.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.520]   I'm just gonna give up now.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.640]   I'm gonna leave it there.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.120]   Verse 11 to 12.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:56.980]   The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus,
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.880]   "God, I thank you that I am not like other men,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.420]   "extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
[00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.180]   "or even like this tax collector.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.120]   "I fast twice a week, I give tithes of all that I get."
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.860]   And so this guy is basically saying,
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:11.520]   "Hey, thank you."
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.600]   Now, first of all, he separates himself.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.760]   He stands by himself.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.880]   And you saw in the video,
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.680]   he stands in a prominent place in the temple,
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.600]   then he says, "God, thank you."
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.020]   By the way, that's the only time he talks to God.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.700]   "God," he starts, and then he says,
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.560]   "Thank you for how amazing I am.
[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.080]   "Thank you, God, that you made me so good."
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.560]   And he separates himself completely from everyone else.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.460]   Now, separates himself just enough
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.540]   so that other people can still hear him talking.
[00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.440]   And so he's like, "I am so glad, God.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.560]   "I am so glad that you didn't make me like that.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.780]   "I am just so proud that you made me the way I am."
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:55.540]   Now, just before I continue to stamp on the Pharisee,
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.380]   let me tell you something.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.120]   There is something that's actually good about them.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.200]   The origins of where the Pharisees even came about
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.560]   is a group of people who looked at society,
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.400]   looked at culture, and were like,
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.960]   "We cannot keep following all this.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.880]   "Paganism is overtaking our culture.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.100]   "Hellenistic beliefs are taking over our culture.
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.380]   "Gnosticism is taking over our culture.
[00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:17.380]   "We must stand firm.
[00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:18.560]   "We must know the truth.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.740]   "We must live the truth.
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.060]   "We must memorize the truth.
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.700]   "We must live this way.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.260]   "We must be holy.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.300]   "We must be set apart."
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.340]   Those are good things, right?
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.100]   And so they're saying, "We must be different."
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.060]   You know what we must be?
[00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:33.840]   We must be in this world,
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.900]   but we must not be of this world.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.720]   Pharisees, fellow Pharisees, gather together.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.180]   Let's keep to ourselves because we know the truth,
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.520]   and we need to live by it to the highest standard
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.680]   we possibly, possibly can.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.340]   That's pretty good, right?
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.580]   So they are good intentions.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.560]   But then somewhere along the line,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.580]   and this happens with all of humanity, all of us do this.
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.860]   We start off with good intentions,
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.860]   and then it slowly, slowly just starts to go down.
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.420]   We start off here, and then suddenly
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.660]   our hearts start to get hard.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:00.500]   And before you know it, what was good intentions
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.500]   in the first place now have become,
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.700]   their hearts have become hardened,
[00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.020]   and they've become obnoxious.
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:08.860]   They were supposed to be set apart,
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.260]   but now they've set themselves above.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.220]   That's the problem.
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.580]   And that's what pride does.
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.140]   Pride looks at other people,
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:19.500]   and then he starts talking to himself,
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.900]   and he starts saying, "Hey, I have so many things
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.220]   "I'm thankful for, God, because of the way you've made me."
[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.940]   He's not talking to God at all.
[00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.140]   He's saying, he may have started off saying God,
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.820]   but then he's really talking to himself.
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.820]   He's talking for himself, by himself, to himself.
[00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.340]   This is all about him.
[00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.100]   Now, the good thing is, this is where I do remember,
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:38.700]   the good thing is, I'm glad he did that,
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.140]   because I'm not sure God really had that much to say to him.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.780]   D.L. Moody has this thing that says,
[00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.140]   "God has nothing to say to the self-righteous."
[00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:49.740]   And so actually, it's very well
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.020]   that the Pharisee isn't talking to God,
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.340]   because I don't think God is talking to him,
[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.780]   because God only talks to the people
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.700]   who are willing to listen,
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.980]   who humble themselves to be wanting to hear his voice.
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:02.100]   But the Pharisees here, they are completely going one way.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.940]   He's saying, "I am so disciplined.
[00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:06.020]   "I am so disciplined.
[00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.620]   "I fast twice a week."
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.460]   Do you know how often they actually needed to fast?
[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.220]   Once a year, once a year.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.060]   The holiest Jewish day, the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur.
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.380]   They needed to fast once a year.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.460]   And he's like, "But I'm fasting twice a week."
[00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:24.420]   My math isn't great,
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.500]   but that means I'm doing 100 times more
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.260]   than what I'm supposed to be doing.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.260]   Aren't I amazing?
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.540]   Tithing, I'm tithing on everything.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.820]   They were only supposed to tithe
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.780]   off the food that they got, the crops.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.460]   But he's like, "God, I'm not even just tithing my food.
[00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.140]   "I'm not even just tithing my shake shack.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.980]   "I'm gonna tithe everything.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.140]   "I'm gonna tithe my salary.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:45.980]   "I'm gonna tithe my house.
[00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.260]   "I'm gonna tithe any income that I get.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:48.700]   "I'm gonna tithe my children.
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.620]   "I'm gonna tithe everything,
[00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.940]   "because I am so generous, God.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.660]   "I'm more disciplined than any
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.980]   "of these other people down here.
[00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.100]   "I'm more generous than all these people here."
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.060]   That's what he's saying.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.340]   But God doesn't have anything to say
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.860]   to the self-righteous.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.260]   And then we go to the tax collector, verse 13.
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.860]   Oh, sorry.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.180]   But the tax collector,
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:14.980]   but the tax collector, standing far off,
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.060]   would not even lift up his eyes to heaven,
[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.260]   but beat his breast, saying,
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.980]   "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.580]   We have one guy who walks into the temple to pray,
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.900]   and he stands right in the middle,
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.820]   separates himself from the other people.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.700]   He says, "God," and then just blurts out his whole CV
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.380]   of how amazing he is.
[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.620]   There's another guy, the used car salesman,
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.220]   who comes into the temple,
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:40.220]   but he can't even look up.
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.580]   Now, you're supposed to be standing to pray.
[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.540]   That was the common thing back then, to stand and pray.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.500]   But he gets into the temple,
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.940]   but he can't even look up, so he looks down.
[00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.420]   And more than that, he starts beating his breast.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.300]   I don't know if you've done this.
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.900]   I tried this as I was practicing and preparing this sermon.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.500]   It actually hurts quite, everyone try it, gently, though,
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.500]   especially if you're nearly turning 70.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.820]   Just do it really gentle.
[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:04.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.940]   All right, just do it over, he can't hear me.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.020]   There you go, beating.
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.340]   Why is he beating his breast?
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.420]   Why is he beating his chest?
[00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.580]   When have you beat your breast?
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.380]   When you are in absolute despair.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:22.380]   When your heart is just so overcome by guilt and shame,
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.220]   just completely broken, you're like,
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.900]   "Oh, I am such a wretched sinner.
[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.820]   "I am such a wreck."
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.740]   Can we understand a little bit
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.300]   of what the tax collector's going through here?
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.580]   He didn't actually need to go to the temple.
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.340]   Judging by who he is,
[00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.900]   he knows that every time he walks around
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:45.020]   in anywhere in that vicinity,
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.060]   he's gonna be looked upon and judged upon.
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.180]   He doesn't need to be there, and he's not a good person.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.100]   Let's not suddenly turn him into an angel.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.180]   He's a tax collector.
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.820]   He knows he's a sinner,
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.820]   but he's so overcome by his own guilt.
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.940]   He doesn't just stay at home,
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.020]   he's like, "I have to do something,
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.000]   "but I don't know what to do,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.160]   "so I'm gonna drag myself.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.980]   "I'm gonna climb up those stairs to the temple.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.340]   "I'm gonna stand there, but now I'm here.
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.020]   "I don't even know what to say.
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.440]   "I don't even dare look up,
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.420]   "so I'm just gonna beat my chest."
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.780]   That's the desperation that he has.
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.260]   He's like, "I am a sinner.
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.220]   "I have no, have you been there?"
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.020]   Where you're just like, "I am at my end.
[00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:28.580]   "I don't know how I can save myself.
[00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.940]   "I need help."
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.140]   But then you get there, and you come to church,
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.880]   and everyone's raising their hands and jumping around,
[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.440]   and you're just like, "I can't.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.860]   "I can't, I'm just, have you been there?"
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.600]   That's what the tax collector is.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.640]   And then he says, "Be merciful to me, a sinner."
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.620]   He doesn't say any more than that.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.200]   He doesn't have any CV worth sharing.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.920]   He just says, "Be merciful to me, a sinner."
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.500]   Now, when he says, "Be merciful to me,"
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:01.000]   he's actually, in the original language,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.400]   it's not just, "God, would you just show me mercy?
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.920]   "Would you just look away?
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.520]   "Actually, would you just make an exception for me,
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.920]   "lower the bar so that I can step in today?
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.540]   "Lord, can you just let me off the hook?"
[00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.440]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.560]   The original, the original meaning of this is
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.040]   not just, "Show mercy to me," it's, "Be merciful to me."
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.880]   It's, "Apply atonement to me.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.540]   "Make me right.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.220]   "God, be merciful to me.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.200]   "I am a sinner, and I can't do anything to save myself.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.640]   "I know I need saving.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.200]   "Would you apply atonement to me?
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.020]   "I am disconnected from you,
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:40.280]   "and I don't know how to get back.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.400]   "But would you reach down and apply atonement to me?"
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.980]   "Be merciful to me and save me."
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.800]   That's what he's saying.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.660]   He's saying, "I need to be saved, but I don't know how.
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.160]   "And I know you can do it, and I can't.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.740]   "So would you be merciful to me, a sinner?"
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.920]   That's what he's saying.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.660]   And then we reach, really, the final,
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.420]   the central axiom of this little parable here.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:13.860]   Verse 14, he says, "I tell you this.
[00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.420]   "I tell you, this man went down to his house justified,
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.460]   "made right, right in the eyes of God,
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.540]   "rather than the other.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.540]   "For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,
[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:26.380]   "but the one who humbles himself will be exalted."
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:28.180]   Now, we're not just talking about Pharisees anymore.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.020]   He's saying everyone.
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:32.060]   Everyone who humbles themselves will be exalted,
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.000]   will be justified, will be saved.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.540]   And those who declare themselves,
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.300]   who trust in themselves, who think they're righteous,
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.060]   who think they're good, they will be humbled.
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.860]   The whole point of this is humility.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.860]   And he's saying, "Anyone who comes to God
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.780]   "with a lowly heart, emptying himself, God will fill.
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.780]   "But anyone who comes with pride, you will be humbled."
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.700]   Another D.L. Moody quote says this.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.300]   "God sends no one away empty,
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.740]   "except those who are full of themselves."
[00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.300]   God sends no one away empty,
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.940]   except those who are full of themselves.
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:06.140]   'Cause why does he need to do anything?
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:09.340]   The Pharisee doesn't need anything from God.
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.100]   In fact, it sounds like God needs to interview with him.
[00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.740]   But if you humble yourself,
[00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.580]   if you recognize that you actually need to be filled,
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.820]   if you recognize that you actually need to be saved,
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.180]   then we're talking.
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.020]   The problem here is this, and Spurgeon says this.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.620]   "The greatest enemy to human souls
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.060]   "is the self-righteous spirit,
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.420]   "which makes men look to themselves for salvation."
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.140]   There was a quote earlier that I forgot to share.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.860]   Actually, self-righteousness is the devil's masterpiece
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.820]   in letting you think better of yourself,
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.620]   that you think you are good enough.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.380]   That pride, that is the most toxic, dangerous thing
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.580]   that we can have as the church.
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:46.460]   When we say, "We're good, we're good, we're doing all right.
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.460]   "We don't need a savior."
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.740]   But the whole point is that we do.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.180]   The whole point is that we do.
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:57.020]   So what we humble ourselves is what we're saying here.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.820]   Final one, "There is no pride so dangerous,
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:02.060]   "none so subtle and insidious as the pride of holiness."
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.900]   There is no pride as toxic as self-righteousness.
[00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:10.540]   And so we know that.
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.500]   And so yes, we can go away and we can say,
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.700]   "Okay, well, I will try not to be prideful."
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.700]   But what are we actually really gleaning from this
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:19.900]   that we can actually apply?
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.780]   As we look at how the Pharisee prays,
[00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:23.500]   as we look at how the tax collector prays,
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.420]   as we think about why Jesus told the story
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:27.980]   in the first place, what can we really glean from it?
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:28.940]   And I think there's a couple of things
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.820]   that I think would be helpful for us.
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.100]   The first thing is this.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.820]   You or me, we should not be the focus of our prayer.
[00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:40.780]   We should not be the focus of our prayer.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.220]   Have a think right now when you pray,
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.300]   when you pray on your own or when in a small group,
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.180]   what are the things that fill your mind?
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:47.980]   What are the things that you talk about?
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.500]   God, Father, God, thank you.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:54.100]   And I've got all these things I need to request of you.
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.820]   God, can you help me live a more comfortable life?
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.340]   Can you help me get the job that I want to have?
[00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.060]   Can you help me be rid of this illness already
[00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.860]   would you help me find a spouse?
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.700]   Would you help me do this?
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.500]   Would you help me have things go smooth
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.540]   and your timing is always good so it's working out?
[00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.020]   Because I really want to get on that holiday,
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.220]   completely healthy with all my work done
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.260]   and so I can have a really nice ski trip.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.580]   When you pray, are you the focus of your prayer?
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:22.420]   Or is it him?
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.060]   Jesus teaches them how to pray.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:27.220]   And he says, our Father in heaven,
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:28.460]   hallowed be your name, your kingdom come,
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.820]   your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.780]   There is nothing about personal requests.
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.580]   There is nothing about personal bragging there at all.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:37.060]   It is all about him.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.060]   We should not be the focus of our prayer.
[00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.460]   A theologian describes this parable,
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.380]   what Jesus is talking about.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.740]   This Pharisee is basically glancing at God
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:48.140]   and contemplating himself.
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.740]   Do you do that?
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:51.580]   Do I do that?
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:52.980]   I think I often do.
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:55.660]   I'm so engrossed in my own personal circumstances,
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.380]   my own ambitions, my own desires,
[00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:03.460]   I glance at God and I'm completely contemplating myself.
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.500]   Where does that come from?
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.660]   Where does that come from?
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.700]   Why do we have that?
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.980]   I think ultimately it's because we want to live a life
[00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.180]   that looks good to everyone on the outside.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.260]   Just like this Pharisee who walks at the temple
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.020]   and wants to show everyone how holy and how good he is.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.100]   His prayer and his worship is completely focused on him.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.140]   It's all about look at me.
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.300]   There's someone who said there are two kinds of people
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.660]   in the world, those who walk into a room and say,
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.940]   "There you are."
[00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.140]   And there are those who walk into a room and say,
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.020]   "Here I am."
[00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:39.660]   The Pharisee is the one who walks in and says,
[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.500]   "Here I am."
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.940]   We are now in a culture where it is all about look at me.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.780]   Look at me.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.420]   Look at everything that I do.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.700]   Look at my CV.
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.660]   I want you to accept me.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.300]   I want you to admire me.
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.180]   I want you to adore me.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:58.980]   Everything, I want you to just focus on me.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:03.420]   9th of February, 2009,
[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.980]   it's the day that mankind, we as a society,
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.740]   changed and not for the better.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:10.420]   9th of February, 2009.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:12.100]   Do you know what that day is?
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.260]   What happened that day?
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:19.540]   That was the day that Facebook invented the button like.
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:22.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.020]   Like.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.020]   Like.
[00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.540]   Ooh, like.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:27.820]   Ooh, like.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:30.100]   And now it's ooh, love.
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.340]   Ooh, ha ha.
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.820]   Ooh, and then they invented poke.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:34.780]   Do you remember poke?
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:35.940]   That was annoying, wasn't it?
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.380]   I'm so glad that's disappeared now.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.540]   Poke, poke you.
[00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.380]   Stop poking me.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.700]   Poke, poke, stop poking me.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.900]   Poke.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:42.740]   Like.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:47.260]   Before that, may it be we shared things about our lives
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.860]   on social media because we wanted to share with people
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.420]   just the stuff that we do in life.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:53.980]   And then people comment on them and go,
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.540]   oh, that's so nice.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.340]   And then the like button came.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.140]   And now we share posts to get the likes.
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.100]   Now we share posts to get those comments.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.380]   You look on social media now,
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.780]   and we all live on social media.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.500]   Depending on your age will determine what app you're using,
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.000]   but we're all on social media.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.700]   And you're all doing this, and we're all doing this,
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.820]   and we're all seeking approval.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:17.420]   I'll tell you, I'll post something and I'll be like,
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:20.180]   ah, how many people liked my post?
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:22.220]   How many people responded to my story?
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.580]   How many people loved my story?
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:25.420]   Love it.
[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.740]   Like, like.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.100]   Look at me, look at me, look at me.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:33.500]   How many of us have posted something,
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:35.140]   posted a bad picture of ourselves?
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.060]   Like really terrible.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:37.180]   And actually, just as I said that,
[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.480]   you two have posted a pretty ugly picture of yourselves.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.280]   Respect, respect.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:49.980]   But we don't, because we all want to show our best side.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.740]   We all want to have the right angle,
[00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.640]   the right filter.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.700]   Everything needs to be right.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:58.220]   What we say in the caption has to be smart,
[00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.660]   and clever, and cool, and hip, and right.
[00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.780]   The latte that I'm drinking has to be perfectly lit,
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.940]   so when I share it, people will see how cool my life is.
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.780]   Right?
[00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.080]   Everything, and the people that I'm doing selfies with,
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.820]   everything is look at me, look at me.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.380]   If we keep going back, what are we actually saying here?
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.380]   That need for approval.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.320]   That need for the like.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.060]   What are we saying here?
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.360]   We're craving attention.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.700]   We're craving attention, why?
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.520]   Because we don't realize how much God loves us.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.420]   It's like a child just crying out for the parents' attention.
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.120]   Hey, look at me, daddy, look at me, daddy, look at me.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.000]   We say that.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.100]   We act in a way to seek approval,
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.520]   because we don't believe our Father in heaven loves us,
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.960]   and is looking at us, and adores us.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.740]   And so we go and find attention
[00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.960]   anywhere and everywhere else.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:55.460]   But if we understood that,
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:58.620]   if we understood how much the Father loved us,
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:01.780]   that we don't need to seek anyone else's approval but his,
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.980]   I think we would stop doing things for show.
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.740]   I think we would live in a way that is completely free,
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.260]   because we know our Father in heaven loves us.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:12.940]   I think some of us are more susceptible to this.
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.260]   Don't know how many of you love
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.820]   kind of like the personality tests
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.980]   and those kinds of things,
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.780]   and the Enneagram test is one of them.
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.260]   And I don't know too much about it now.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.100]   I stopped looking at it,
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.340]   but I remember that when I did the test,
[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:24.940]   I was an Enneagram three.
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:27.020]   Anyone want to know what an Enneagram three is?
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:27.860]   You do?
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.060]   The Achiever, the Achiever.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.160]   And what I got out about personality tests was,
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.020]   if you're an Enneagram three, you're an Achiever,
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.020]   it means that you really care
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.000]   what other people think about you.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.500]   So actually, you can take that one,
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.260]   you can keep that one every time I'm talking to you.
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:43.300]   I'm hoping that you like me.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.700]   And so when I'm unhealthy, that's all I'm trying to do.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.540]   I'm trying to get approval, trying to get compliments,
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:51.540]   trying people to like me.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.160]   So when I'm, I've done this before.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.700]   When I posted something up and I go back and see,
[00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.020]   I just want to see how many likes there are.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.220]   I want to see who's liked my picture.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:58.300]   I want to see why.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.380]   So then I just want to be liked.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.260]   That's when I'm unhealthy.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.180]   But when I'm healthy, I realize, gosh,
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.100]   God loves me so much.
[00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.500]   He's always looking at me.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.420]   I don't need any attention from anywhere else.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.300]   So the focus of my worship,
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.140]   the focus of my prayer is not to show you guys
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.860]   how good I am, but it's just to tell him how good he is.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.300]   Because I know that he's looking at me.
[00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:25.100]   We should not be the focus of our prayers.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.300]   Now, Jesus talks about this,
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.220]   'cause he says in his sermon on the mountain again,
[00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:29.780]   he's saying, "Hey, when you do good things,
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:30.620]   "don't let your right hand know
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.660]   "what your left hand is doing.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.440]   "When you're praying, don't stand on a street corner
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.760]   "and speak loudly with long words.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.100]   "Your father who sees in secret knows.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.880]   "You've already had your reward if you get all that.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.820]   "You get all that manly praise.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.660]   "So don't do that."
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.660]   And then he's saying to the other guys,
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:45.420]   and the gospel is saying,
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.660]   "Hey, you guys are just cleaning the outside of your cup,
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.200]   "but the inside is completely dirty.
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.780]   "You are worshiping me with your lips,
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:53.820]   "but your hearts are far from me."
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:29:00.380]   Your prayer, my worship, who's the focus?
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.460]   Are we glancing at God and contemplating ourselves,
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.920]   or are we truly freed from that need
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.100]   for approval from others?
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.120]   And are we focusing on the only one who's good?
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.860]   People often say there's two kinds of people in the world.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.300]   There's good people and there's bad people.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:16.100]   The movies seem to tell us that.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.220]   There's the hero and there's the villain.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.200]   The truth is, it isn't quite that simple.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.220]   If anything, there are only two kinds of people
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.040]   in the world.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.520]   There are lots and lots of bad people,
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.200]   and there's only one good person, Jesus.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.560]   He should be the focus of our worship and prayer,
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.540]   not ourselves.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.960]   The second thing is this.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.360]   We should not compare ourselves to others.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.960]   This Pharisee looks across at the tax collector and say,
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.860]   "God, I'm so thankful I'm not like him.
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.280]   "Dodged a bullet there.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.480]   "Thank you for that, but I'm gonna take it from here now
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.120]   "and be the best person that I can be,
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.800]   "the greatest you ever lived,
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.540]   "but thank you that I didn't start off like him."
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.140]   Comparison is a dangerous thing.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:03.140]   Comparison is a very dangerous thing, and we all compare.
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.180]   Studies say that we start comparing
[00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.580]   when we're seven years old.
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.120]   And I told you this story before.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.500]   Reuben arrived when he was six when we came to Hong Kong,
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.880]   and then shortly after he turned seven,
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.720]   he'd look at me and go,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.200]   "Daddy, why do people's cars open like this?
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.280]   "That is so cool.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.200]   "I've never seen that before.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.780]   "Why does ours, wait, why don't we have a car?"
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:25.680]   (laughing)
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.580]   And I was like, "Oh, man, here we go."
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.680]   And comparison is dangerous, why?
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:35.200]   You'll never get out, you'll never get away from comparing
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.100]   without putting someone down and lifting someone up, never.
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.860]   Compare anything, even with like a neutral heart.
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:44.260]   You're basically saying, "Okay, which one's better, which?"
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.660]   You're asking for something to be put above
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.080]   and something to be placed beneath.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.940]   It's the pride that it leads to,
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.340]   and it's a very dangerous thing.
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.620]   That's why we're told, when we're focusing on our life,
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:58.240]   just focus on the prize.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.780]   Paul says, "I press on towards the goal
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.200]   "of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.060]   "I'm not looking at anything else."
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:03.940]   Do you remember sports day?
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.540]   For those of us who used to run in the long distance
[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.440]   or the short distances,
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.740]   what are you told to do by a PE teacher and your parents?
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.860]   Don't look to the side, don't compare.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.140]   Keep your eyes focused on here,
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.740]   'cause the moment you look here,
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.460]   you'll realize where they are, and it'll distract you.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.260]   So comparison is a bad thing, do not compare.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:25.460]   And we all fall short of this.
[00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.580]   Now, I don't think any of us are here like,
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.500]   "Oh, when I come to church, I look at some people
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.260]   "and I go, 'Oh, that person is so bad.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:31.460]   "'They worship in such a weird way.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.460]   "'They worship with their arms crossed, that's weird.'"
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.220]   I'm guessing that none of you do that.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.880]   But then, actually, are there things that we,
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.600]   even as a church, are guilty of?
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.600]   This Pharisee is guilty of comparing in the temple.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.360]   Do we have temple comparisons in this modern day?
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.840]   We do.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:55.720]   Society is becoming more and more polarized in every way,
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.320]   and it's seeped into the church, right?
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.540]   There's all these different kinds of Christians now.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.920]   There's evangelical Christians, there's charismatics,
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.400]   there's Presbyterians, there's liberal,
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.440]   there's conservative, there's progressive.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.360]   I lose track of all the different names that we can have
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.980]   for different type of Christians, right?
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.520]   We've got the Presbyterians looking over
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.740]   at the charismatics and going,
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.180]   "Oh, those guys just worship with their heart,
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.200]   "and they're just all feely,
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:23.400]   "and they're singing choruses a hundred times,
[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.720]   "and just never stop singing.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.640]   "Finish the song already!"
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.040]   And you're not using your brain at all,
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.180]   and you're praying as though everything will happen,
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.740]   that God will grant you your request to everything.
[00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.500]   And then the charismatics are looking over
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.340]   at the Presbyterians and going,
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.580]   "You guys don't even use your heart at all.
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.860]   "You're just stone statues,
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.300]   "and you just filled your head with knowledge,
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.700]   "and you're praying as though nothing will ever happen."
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.460]   Of course, both those sides, forgive me, both sides.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.740]   But we see, we look at that and go,
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:52.980]   "Oh, that church is so liberal,
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.100]   "that church is so conservative,
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.280]   "that church is so this, that church is so that.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.120]   "Aren't we doing that?
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.340]   "That church sings this kind of music.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.780]   "Oh, that church does this kind of theology."
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.560]   Every time we start comparing,
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.700]   what we're doing is we're trying to find a place
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.300]   where we can say we're superior and they're inferior.
[00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:09.740]   And that's the pride.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.900]   That's the self-righteousness.
[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.620]   That's us trusting in ourselves.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:16.540]   That's saying, "Hey, we've got the right theology.
[00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.840]   "We've got the right way of worship.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.460]   "We've got the right way to reach young people.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.420]   "We've got the right way to reach old people."
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.300]   And you don't.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.480]   Comparison is a dangerous thing, brothers and sisters.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.320]   Don't compare.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.820]   Our worship, our prayer does not need comparing.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.100]   We're all beautifully made in very different ways,
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.620]   and we all worship in different ways,
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:37.340]   and we all process God and worship Him
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.220]   in very different ways.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:40.140]   The Apostle Paul, 1 Corinthians 14 says,
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:43.040]   "I worship with my mind and I worship with my spirit."
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.360]   We as a church, can we stop comparing?
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.580]   It's the whole mission of one church, right?
[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:52.700]   Can we stop comparing?
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:56.860]   Can we just say, "We are made so beautifully different."
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.060]   We should not compare.
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.860]   Because Scripture tells us we need to look at others
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.120]   and go, "You're more significant than me."
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.980]   That's what Scripture is telling.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.500]   But instead, we look at them and go,
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.540]   "Oh, out of our own insecurity,
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.300]   "we're trying to find their flaws."
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.060]   That's what we're doing, right?
[00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.140]   'Cause we don't feel that good about ourselves,
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.140]   but we're looking at other people and go,
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:20.180]   "Oh, well, they're even worse.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:21.580]   "That makes me feel better."
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.260]   We should not be the focus of our prayer.
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.780]   We should not compare ourselves to others as well.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.740]   And finally, we should not trust in ourselves.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.420]   (baby crying)
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.540]   He's talking to a group of people
[00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.480]   who trusted in themselves, right?
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.980]   I was having lunch recently with someone, a dear friend,
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.940]   and we go for lunch a lot.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.380]   And I'll say, "Hey, imagine if Jesus
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:45.440]   "walked through the door right now, how would you feel?
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.280]   "What would you do?"
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.120]   He's like, "Well, I feel pretty good about myself.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:52.040]   "But I don't think I've done anything majorly wrong.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.660]   "I don't think I've cheated, I've not killed anyone,
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.380]   "paid my taxes, I'm pretty good.
[00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.820]   "I've not done any major sins."
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.660]   I'm like, "Do you think that's gonna be enough?"
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.020]   He's like, "I think so."
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:03.860]   And I'm like, "I don't know,
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.280]   "I don't think it's gonna be enough
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.420]   "because we're not justified by our works."
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.460]   Today, literally today, as I was walking back home,
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.780]   the security guard shouts out to me,
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:15.740]   "Hey, Dan San, Mr. Tang, I heard you're a pastor."
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.300]   I said, "I am."
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.300]   He's like, "You don't look like a pastor."
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:20.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.740]   I was like, "What does a pastor look like?"
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:23.860]   Only just today when I walked in,
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.020]   someone said I look more like a triad than a pastor.
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:26.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:27.700]   Thank you, Paul.
[00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:29.740]   (Dan laughing)
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.340]   Just watch yourself.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.100]   And then he started talking to me,
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.620]   and then we had this 20-minute conversation
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.820]   with my security guard.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.340]   And he was like, "Oh, well, oh yeah, yeah,
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.700]   "I believe in Jesus.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:44.560]   "And actually, my primary school teacher told me this.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.960]   "I went to a Catholic school."
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.980]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.900]   Like, good people go up there, bad people go down here.
[00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:53.020]   End of story.
[00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.820]   He's like, "Oh yeah, but I believe in Jesus,
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.460]   "and I believe that he lived and he died.
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.620]   "I get that, but yeah, good people up here,
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.460]   "bad people down here."
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.060]   And I said, "Oh, well, if it's good people up here
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.000]   "and bad people down here,
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.600]   "then why did Jesus have to die?
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.600]   "Because then you just, you'd be good,
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.240]   "and you make your choice, and you go here.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.420]   "What was the whole point of Jesus dying?"
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.500]   He's like, "Hmm, I don't know.
[00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.780]   "Why is that?"
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.940]   I said, "Because I don't think any of us
[00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.300]   "will ever be good enough."
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:20.420]   Because we're talking perfection, right?
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.300]   We're talking the righteousness of God up here.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.940]   You'll never reach that.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.740]   Mother Teresa never reached that,
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:31.100]   because there's bound to be some flaw in all of us,
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.220]   because that's not it.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.380]   We're not justified by our work,
[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.260]   so we can't trust in ourselves.
[00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.500]   There's a pastor here that says this.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.720]   "I believe that a great number of people
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.080]   "are going to die and go to hell
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.740]   "because they're counting on their religiosity
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.640]   "in the church instead of their relationship with Jesus
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.900]   "to get them to heaven.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.520]   "They will give lip service to repentance and faith,
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.900]   "but they've never been born again."
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.020]   Doesn't that send chills down your spine?
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.060]   When I ask you, "Hey, how confident are you in Jesus?"
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.100]   You're like, "Oh, well, I've been going to church.
[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:57.940]   "My attendance this month is 75%.
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:00.880]   "Pretty good, no fail.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.720]   "I don't know if it's enough.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.220]   "Oh, I've been donating to charities.
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.940]   "Pretty good, no, I don't know."
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.340]   Because it's not about that.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:11.280]   The apostle Paul had the greatest CV, right?
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.460]   He had the greatest CV in Philippians 3.
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.960]   He says, "I was circumcised on the eighth day
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.860]   "of the people of Israel.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.480]   "I was a Hebrew of Hebrews.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.840]   "As to the law, I was a Pharisee.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.680]   "I knew everything.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:20.540]   "I followed all the laws.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.360]   "I disciplined myself in every way,
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.780]   "more than any other people.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.660]   "As to zeal, I persecuted the church.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.780]   "As to righteousness under the law, blameless."
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.900]   And then he says the secret,
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.180]   "But whatever gain I had, I count as loss
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.280]   "because of the surpassing worth
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.300]   "of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord."
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.600]   That's the thing that matters.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.580]   It's not what you do, it's who you know.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.900]   And it's only Jesus that will get you in.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.040]   Good people go down here, bad people down here.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.240]   That is wrong theology.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.400]   'Cause it doesn't work like that,
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.300]   because you will never be good enough.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.880]   Jesus says only one person is good.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:57.320]   And he says, "Be perfect for your Father in heaven
[00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.520]   "is perfect."
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.080]   Now, if you're confident that you're gonna be perfect,
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.000]   then good luck to you.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.760]   But for the rest of us, we need a savior.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.400]   We need someone to save us.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.960]   So do not trust in yourself.
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.560]   And it's not how you look on the outside.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.860]   Can you tell from this Pharisee,
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.000]   his perception of righteousness and of sin
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.520]   was completely external.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.920]   The way he fasted, the way he donated,
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:24.080]   the way he did everything, everything was external.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:29.320]   But what he didn't realize was that God looks at the heart.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.840]   One of my favorite books of recent times
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.360]   is called "The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse."
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.200]   Fantastic book.
[00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.120]   And it has just, for those who don't like reading,
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.400]   if this is the book for you,
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.480]   there's like six words on each page.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.320]   Okay?
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.960]   "The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, the Horse."
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.360]   Incredible, my daughter absolutely loves it.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.720]   Written by a Christian, goes to HDB in London.
[00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.560]   Incredible.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.120]   And if you really, really can't even read six words
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.120]   on a page, it's on Apple TV.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.320]   30 minute cartoon.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.320]   It's incredible.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.360]   And it says this one thing, I think I've got it actually.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   Isn't it odd?
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.800]   So I think, I can't remember which character
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.320]   was talking to which, but it says this.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.480]   Isn't it odd?
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.080]   We can only see our outsides,
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.440]   but nearly everything happens on the inside.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.680]   We can only see our outsides,
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.120]   but nearly everything happens on the inside.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.960]   The Pharisee had an understanding of sin
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.040]   and righteousness all external.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.960]   He didn't realize everything was internal.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.040]   The way we go about our faith is all about sin management.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.120]   My dear friend who was like,
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:30.520]   I think it'll go okay if Jesus comes in.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.160]   He's thinking where the floor is.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.000]   Sin management, I'm not doing these things,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:35.840]   I'm gonna be okay.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.600]   But that's what Christianity is about.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.240]   Christianity isn't about sin management,
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.680]   it's about striving up here.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.920]   It's about our heart.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.680]   It's about heart transformation
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:48.960]   as opposed to behavior modification.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.680]   We should not be the focus of our prayer,
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.040]   we should not compare ourselves to others,
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.720]   and we cannot trust in ourselves.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.000]   What Jesus is saying here is,
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.400]   those who think they are good won't get in.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.840]   Those who know they're wicked, they will.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.000]   Those who think they're good won't get in.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.440]   Those who know they won't, they will get in.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.160]   That's what he's saying.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.120]   Let me finish here.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.880]   When I shared with you what the tax collector said,
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:16.800]   be merciful to me, a sinner.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.600]   Apply atonement to me, make me right.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:23.840]   I can't make myself right.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.440]   Apply atonement unto me.
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.000]   Connect me back with you again, only you can do it.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.880]   That word there only happens twice in the New Testament.
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.200]   One time is right here,
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.740]   and another time is in Hebrews 2.17.
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.920]   Therefore he had to be made like his brothers
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.000]   in every respect so that he might become
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.960]   a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.360]   to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.000]   To make propitiation, to make right, to apply atonement.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.520]   That's the only other place this word comes up.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.840]   To be merciful.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:02.220]   It's saying, what he's saying here is,
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.200]   not God, would you lower the bar so I can hop in?
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.920]   He's saying, would you help me?
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.720]   I am in deep need of atonement.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.120]   Would you come and save me?
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:17.000]   Would you come and save me?
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.400]   When you truly understand then what happens next,
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.360]   that's what frees you.
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.000]   Because how does he save you?
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.600]   Jesus becomes the sinner for you.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:30.320]   For God made the one who knew no sin to be sin
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.800]   so that we would receive what?
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.720]   The righteousness of God.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:39.000]   Jesus became the sinner and took all of our sin
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.600]   and paid all of our debt
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:46.200]   so that we would have atonement applied onto us.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.940]   That we would be made right in him.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:52.000]   At the end of the day,
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.800]   there are only two kinds of people in the world.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.400]   Those who are saved and those who are not.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.120]   Those who think they're good
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:03.400]   and those who know they are wicked.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:07.420]   Those who think eternal life can be earned.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.100]   And those who know that it's a gift.
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:15.600]   Those who seek God and people's commendation
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.480]   and those who seek forgiveness.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.080]   Those who are still dead in sin
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.000]   and those who are dead to sin.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.920]   There are only those two kinds of people.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.840]   And you might be, well,
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.360]   how do I get from one side to the other?
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:38.600]   I am still dead in sin, but I want to be dead to sin.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.600]   How do I do that?
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.640]   There's only one way.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.320]   Jesus.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.080]   Jesus is the only one who can apply
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.160]   that atonement onto you.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.920]   He was the only one who was perfect,
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.880]   that was sacrificed so that all your debt would be paid.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.320]   When you truly understand that,
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.760]   then you will have no pride.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.480]   And this week is the perfect week to reflect on this.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.760]   The cross.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.480]   The cross is the only way you can turn
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:10.680]   from this kind of people to this kind of people.
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:11.880]   And the cross is the only way
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.400]   that's gonna help you go across there.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.640]   He is the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.320]   All you need to do is humble yourself before him
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.080]   and say, "God, I need to be saved."
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:23.240]   I'll finish with this quote here.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.120]   "Every time we look at the cross,
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.120]   "Christ seems to say to us,
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.800]   "I am here because of you.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.840]   "It is your sin I am bearing.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.800]   "Your curse I am suffering.
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.420]   "Your debt I am paying.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.940]   "Your death I am dying."
[00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:39.180]   Nothing in history or in the universe
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.180]   cuts you down to size like the cross.
[00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:43.000]   All of us have inflated views of ourselves,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.620]   especially in self-righteousness,
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.220]   until we have visited a place called Calvary.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.380]   It is there, at the foot of the cross,
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:52.540]   that we shrink to our true size.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:56.980]   Brothers and sisters, this week, there is no better week.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:02.280]   Would you find yourself at the place called Calvary?
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.420]   Would you allow the cross, the message of the cross,
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.860]   to speak into your life, to shrink you to your true size,
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.380]   so that you can truly understand
[00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.060]   your deep need for a savior,
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.460]   and that there is hope, that you can be dead to sin.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.980]   You don't have to remain to be dead in sin.
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.320]   You just need to say, "Be merciful to me, God.
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:27.540]   "I am a sinner, and I need you."
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:32.280]   And when that moment comes, you receive that grace.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.380]   It doesn't matter how many times you fail.
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.480]   His grace will remain.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:42.980]   And that is the art, the true art, of losing yourself.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.540]   So your worship and your prayer won't be about you anymore.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.720]   It'll be completely about him.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.120]   My prayer for all of us is,
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:56.140]   would we allow him to really clean us from the inside out,
[00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.660]   and that we would stop thinking just from the outside in?
[00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:03.700]   That we would allow his Holy Spirit to be in us,
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:08.140]   and allow us to be made right in him.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.200]   Righteousness of God.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.740]   Would you join me in prayer as we respond?
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:25.300]   Jesus, we know that in truth,
[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:30.060]   there are many kinds of people in this world,
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.220]   there are not just two.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:37.220]   And we are all types of sinners, but sinners we are.
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:45.500]   Thank you, Lord, that you did apply atonement to our sins,
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.000]   that you did become a sinner,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.300]   so that we would be the righteousness of God,
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.860]   that we would be made right in God's eyes,
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.220]   that we would be justified.
[00:45:55.220 --> 00:46:00.580]   Jesus, we know that you are the answer to our sin.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:06.180]   We know what your cross can provide for us.
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.700]   So we humble ourselves before you,
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.380]   just like the way you did.
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:13.260]   You, Lord, who, though it was in the form of God,
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.820]   did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:16.780]   but you emptied yourself,
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.420]   taking the form of a servant being born
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.760]   in the likeness of men.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.700]   And being found in human form,
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.540]   you humbled yourself by becoming obedient
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.420]   to the point of death, even death on the cross.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.140]   Lord, you humbled yourself for us.
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:34.340]   And therefore God has highly exalted you
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.220]   and bestowed upon you the name that is above every name,
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.300]   so that at your name, every knee will bow
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.900]   and every tongue will confess that you are Lord.
[00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.620]   You were humbled and now you are exalted,
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:47.220]   and we follow your lead.
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:48.060]   Save us, Lord.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:52.440]   Wash us, clean us from the inside out.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.060]   Lord, we want to lose ourselves in wonder and awe of you.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.700]   And every time we fail, we recognize that you,
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.560]   your grace remains for us.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:12.900]   Lord, we concern ourselves less with behavior modification.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.700]   We concern ourselves more with heart transformation.
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:21.920]   We lay down our pride, our self-righteousness.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.860]   We declare, once again, we do not trust in ourselves,
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.180]   but we trust in you.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:30.780]   In your name we pray.
[00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:33.360]   (upbeat music)
