1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
 So a few weeks ago, I feel like I'm an elephant.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,760
 And now I feel like a hippopotamus.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,120
 But it's coming soon.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,880
 I'm really glad to be here.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,520
 And for those of you who have really good eyesight, you can look at my earring, it's

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,480
 all the way up here.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,080
 Now whoever has missed the session, we're going to have more like women's gathering

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
 next year.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,080
 Okay.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,680
 And we would love for all of you to join in.

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,880
 And those who went, can you put your hands up?

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,880
 Yeah.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,880
 Did you enjoy it?

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
 Yeah.

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,080
 Well, I only heard one person, but we were so concentrated making it.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,960
 But anyways, it was a really nice girls time.

17
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,720
 So it allows me to relax and be able to share the word of God with you.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,360
 So good evening.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,360
 Now today we're going to share a topic called personal relationships.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:05,400
 Now we have to admit, I mean, who thinks relationship is easy?

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,920
 It's probably one of the hardest things in life, right?

22
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,760
 I mean, we hear people like changing jobs.

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,920
 You know what most of the reasons are?

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,000
 It's not the job itself, right?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,840
 It's the people, the coworker is the boss, right?

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
 And then we hear about family issues.

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,400
 It's about, oh, well, parents, right?

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
 Okay.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
 Don't tell me about parents.

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,640
 Or like, if those are a Mary, like, oh, my husband or my wife.

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,640
 Okay.

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,560
 Maybe some of you haven't gone there yet.

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,000
 And then there are other issues that, you know, most of them, what does it surround

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 us?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,080
 It's not really the task, right?

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,760
 We can deal with the task, but people, you know, and it's always what other people, right?

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,480
 It's not, it's not you.

38
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,360
 I'm sure it's not you.

39
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,840
 So today we're going to look at like personal relationships.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,720
 And I love the word personal because when we talk about relationships, there are many

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,320
 kinds, right?

42
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,840
 But as actually those that are the closest to us, that gets to us, the people that we

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,800
 need to see all the time, the people we need to interact all the time, acquaintances, it's

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,840
 okay because you know what?

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
 We don't really care about them anyways, right?

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
 But then for those, the closer they get to us, the more we have to interact with, the

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,240
 more personal it gets.

48
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,640
 Now today we're going to be looking at 1 Corinthians chapter six and seven, and we're going to look

49
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,160
 at what apostle Paul is telling us.

50
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,680
 Now we won't be going through all relationships, okay, because that would be too much for us

51
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,680
 to cover, but we are going to be looking at three types.

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,880
 Let's show it on here, the slides.

53
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,520
 So our relationships with other believers, okay?

54
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,560
 And then our relationship with our own body.

55
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,940
 Do you know you have a relationship with your own body?

56
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:06,100
 And then our marital relationship, or if we are not yet, or we like singleness, singleness.

57
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,160
 So we're going to look at those three kinds of relationships, not all of them.

58
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:17,560
 Now in chapter six, apostle Paul mentions that if there's any dispute, okay, within

59
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:24,680
 the Lord's people, so our believers, our fellow brothers and sisters, it says, well, I don't

60
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
 have the PowerPoint.

61
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,880
 I don't have the verses here for you, but I'm going to tell you, apostle Paul tells

62
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,440
 us not to bring those issues to non-believers to judge.

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,080
 And do you know why?

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:47,160
 Because in the future, you and I, believers, we're going to be judging the world and angels.

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,040
 And so he's saying, well, believers, you're going to be judging those people.

66
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,120
 So why are you going to non-believers for judgment?

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,940
 Don't do that.

68
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,220
 Go to believers if you have a dispute.

69
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,840
 And so we're going to start with verse seven in chapter six and look at it together.

70
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,800
 It says here, the very fact that you have lawsuits among you means that you have been

71
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,600
 completely defeated already.

72
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,000
 Why not rather be wronged?

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,320
 Why not rather be cheated?

74
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,560
 Instead, you yourselves cheat and do wrong.

75
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,560
 And you do this to your brothers and sisters.

76
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,760
 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God?

77
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,080
 Do not be deceived.

78
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:42,640
 Neither the sexually immoral adulterers nor men who have sex with men, nor thieves, nor

79
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:51,080
 the greedy, nor the drunkards, nor the slanders or swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.

80
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,000
 And that is what some of you were.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,480
 But you were washed and you were sanctified and you were justified in the name of the

82
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,120
 Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God.

83
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,880
 So what it's telling us here is that at that time, there were some people who had lawsuits.

84
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,920
 And it's saying that if you do have that, you're completely defeated already.

85
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:23,360
 Instead, it says here that we should instead be wronged than rather be bringing a lawsuit

86
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
 up.

87
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,240
 Now we might be asking ourselves, well, what if that person has done a crime to us?

88
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,720
 Does it mean we don't even go to have it justified?

89
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
 It's not what it says here.

90
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
 It's not a crime.

91
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,440
 I do have to say, if there's a crime, please bring it out.

92
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,000
 And that person needs to...

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,720
 It needs to be brought to light.

94
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,640
 But what it's saying here is the word dispute.

95
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,920
 Merely meaning if you and I have a dispute, let's say in the past, there's a property

96
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,680
 line and it's supposed to end here.

97
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,940
 You're like, nope, should end over there.

98
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,860
 Or if there's an argument of some sort where you cannot find agreement on, those kinds

99
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:14,800
 of things, we need not go to someone who is a non-believer, but we should instead go to

100
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,520
 those who are believers, who have wise counsels.

101
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,160
 Now I also want to say, well, how many people of you want to bring your issues of your brother

102
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,200
 and sister to someone and create a lawsuit here?

103
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,280
 No?

104
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
 No one here?

105
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,280
 You sure?

106
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,000
 Okay, so we may ask ourselves, what does it have to do with us then?

107
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,680
 None of us wants to bring about a lawsuit.

108
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,440
 Well what we do see here is even though we might not go to the extent of a lawsuit, sometimes

109
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,500
 when people wrong us, what do we want to do?

110
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
 What do you want to do?

111
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,500
 Anyone?

112
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,640
 What if your brother or sister wronged you?

113
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
 What do you want to do?

114
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
 Huh?

115
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
 Revenge.

116
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,040
 Revenge, thank you.

117
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,720
 Everyone's very honest here, okay?

118
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,680
 The rest of us just keep it to ourselves.

119
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,560
 We might want to do something bad to them, right?

120
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,280
 So really I want to say, yes, if we look at it in the spectrum, if we go all the way,

121
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,400
 it's a lawsuit, but before that, we might want to take revenge.

122
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:32,760
 We might hold grudges against our brothers and sisters, but in here, if we notice, what

123
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,280
 is the attitude we should have?

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,600
 It says that we should not sin.

125
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,840
 We should not be the people that actually deceive.

126
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,400
 We should not be the people that cheat and do wrong, right?

127
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,040
 Instead, what it means is we should have the attitude, even if someone has wronged us during

128
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:04,240
 a dispute, we're to be at least okay with it if they will not apologize or if they will

129
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,880
 not do something about it.

130
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
 Now what is it?

131
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:14,520
 So for us, this brings us to our first point, that when our brother or sister sin against

132
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,360
 us, we need to be sinless.

133
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:26,920
 We need to be the one that's not doing bad, not evil for evil, but good for evil.

134
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,240
 Now I remember a time when I was at church, okay, because we're talking about brothers

135
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,000
 and sisters, right?

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,960
 And then this is the English ministry, and I wanted some help from another department,

137
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,160
 and I asked them, "Hey, can you help us out with this thing?"

138
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:50,000
 And I remember that person replying, "No, what does it have to do with us?"

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,720
 And I remember in my mind, like, "Hey, what do you mean?

140
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,440
 We're church.

141
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,560
 You need to help me.

142
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,400
 You need to help us."

143
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,760
 But anyways, there was nothing much I can do about it.

144
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,080
 I'm like, "Okay, fine."

145
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,920
 So a few days later, I don't know why once these things happen, it's always a few days

146
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,480
 later something else happens, right?

147
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,680
 So a few days later, I realized, "Oh, one of our district's people, we're volunteering

148
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,760
 and helping their district out."

149
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,560
 So inside of me, guess what I wanted to do?

150
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,000
 I wanted to go to that person and say, "Hey, you know what?

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,520
 You're busy that day.

152
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,840
 You don't have time to help them out."

153
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,440
 But I knew in my head, I'm like, "Oh, no, no, no, this isn't right.

154
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,120
 This isn't right and I shouldn't be doing this."

155
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,960
 So eventually I got a chance to talk to that person, the volunteer.

156
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,080
 And then he asked me, "Oh, should I help out on that side?"

157
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,080
 And I was like, "Eh."

158
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,560
 But I was like, "Hey, you know, just go with what's in your heart.

159
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,560
 If the Lord convicts you to help, you help."

160
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,840
 And actually, interestingly enough, the person in the other district a few months later has

161
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:09,400
 actually became my prayer buddy and has been extremely supportive of what we do and what

162
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,400
 I do and just have been walking alongside with me.

163
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:19,520
 And I realized, you know, looking back that, you know, if we actually have disunity, if

164
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,200
 we actually repay evil for evil or so in our eyes we think, what's that going to happen?

165
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,120
 Who's going to win at the end of the day?

166
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,960
 Is it going to be the church?

167
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,600
 No, it's just going to be the devil that wins.

168
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,840
 And I realized that even though this is talk about lawsuits, disputes, but more of it is

169
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:46,840
 talking about our attitude, is our way to deal with our brothers and sisters.

170
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
 We're going to have differences.

171
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,260
 We're going to have disputes.

172
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,680
 And there are times maybe people have constraints and they can't help you and vice versa.

173
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:04,560
 But we should always do good even though there might be things that we don't like.

174
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,700
 So for our brotherly relationship, I encourage all of us and myself also to be sinless and

175
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,160
 to do good.

176
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,200
 Now let's, and the reason that we do that is because in verse seven it says that we

177
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,160
 are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God.

178
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,440
 And that's the reason we do it because God has sanctified us, not because we want to

179
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,160
 be a good person, but because the spirit lives inside of us.

180
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,120
 And that's what we're connected to with our brothers and sisters.

181
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,960
 So as we read on in chapter six, we're going to look at another kind of relationship.

182
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,680
 Let's look at verse 12 to 17 together.

183
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:55,560
 Here Paul says, quoting someone else saying this, "I have the right," sorry, he's quoting

184
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,960
 himself saying this, "I have the right to do anything you say, but not everything is

185
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
 beneficial.

186
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,600
 I have the right to do anything, but I will not be mastered by anything.

187
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,400
 You say food for the stomach and the stomach for food, and God will destroy them both.

188
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:20,120
 The body, however, is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord and the Lord

189
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,800
 for the body.

190
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,200
 By his power, God raised the Lord from the dead and he will raise us also.

191
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,720
 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself?

192
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,880
 Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute?

193
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:47,600
 For do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body?

194
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,240
 For it is said, the two will become one flesh, but whoever is united with the Lord is one

195
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
 with him in spirit."

196
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:05,400
 So here what we see in these few verses is that Paul is telling us that we have the right

197
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,160
 to do anything.

198
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,640
 That is the freedom given to us.

199
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,480
 However, not everything is beneficial.

200
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,040
 So within all those things, the worst of the worst is what?

201
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,840
 Sexual immorality.

202
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,000
 And why?

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,820
 Because it is the only sin that is done within the body.

204
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,840
 Everything else is done outside.

205
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:35,280
 And so this personal relationship now that he's directing us to is actually the relationship

206
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,040
 that we have with our own body.

207
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:47,600
 And we know that a few weeks ago, Pastor Johnny shared with us that at that time, there were

208
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,720
 many pagan temples, right?

209
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,080
 And then what do they have outside?

210
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,680
 Prostitutes.

211
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,320
 Over like a thousand of them.

212
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,280
 And they would come down and look for people and just to have sexual relations with them.

213
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,040
 And they think that that's part of their worship to the fake gods.

214
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,000
 And so in that time, and also actually maybe around us now, a lot of people take it as

215
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,020
 a very, how should I say it?

216
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,840
 Not a very serious matter.

217
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,060
 And yet the Bible tells us that we are the temple of God.

218
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:29,720
 This is a very serious matter for us who are believers.

219
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,200
 And we must all the more guard it.

220
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:38,680
 And so in verse 18, it continues, it says, "Flee from sexual immoralities.

221
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,320
 All other sins a person commits are outside the body.

222
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,520
 But whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body.

223
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:53,000
 Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,080
 have received from God?

225
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,960
 You are not your own."

226
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,680
 I want us to all say that.

227
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,200
 Can we say we are not our own together?

228
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,440
 One, two, three.

229
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,160
 We are not our own.

230
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,760
 You, all of us, were brought at a price.

231
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,080
 And therefore honor God with your bodies.

232
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,520
 Now you see, we, this body does not belong to us.

233
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
 We might think it does.

234
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,200
 I mean, obviously, if I wanted to raise my hand, I can do that.

235
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,040
 But really it doesn't belong to us anymore.

236
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,520
 If we were purchased by Jesus, who does it belong to?

237
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,080
 Jesus.

238
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,920
 Thank you.

239
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,960
 I thought that was a hard question.

240
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,160
 My goodness.

241
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:49,040
 So we don't belong to ourselves anymore, but we act as if we do.

242
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,480
 And that's really the problem.

243
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,020
 And this brings us to our second point, that our relationship concerning our body needs

244
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,320
 to be holy.

245
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,760
 It's not ours anymore.

246
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:06,360
 And you might be saying, "Well, you know, I'm not really having issues with sexual immorality.

247
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,520
 This section doesn't seem to be for me."

248
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,480
 But what it does say is your body doesn't belong to you.

249
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,640
 Except sexual immorality, again, is on that side of the spectrum where it's like the worst

250
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,080
 of the worst.

251
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:27,340
 But then there's all these other things that we need to have self-control over our bodies.

252
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:31,940
 Now I know we've got a few young people, not a few, actually a lot of young people here.

253
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,420
 Who's a young person here?

254
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,260
 Oh, there we go.

255
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,260
 Yeah.

256
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,580
 Pastor John was the first one to raise his hand.

257
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,580
 So woo-hoo.

258
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,980
 Now, who likes sleeping late here?

259
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,740
 Oh, there we go.

260
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,740
 Okay.

261
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,620
 Who thinks they should be sleeping late?

262
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,540
 Yeah, they still got three hands.

263
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,700
 And I mean, who exercises on a regular basis here?

264
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
 All right.

265
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,380
 Those who are very proud to put up their hands, you know?

266
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,740
 And the other ones are like, "Oh."

267
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,420
 I mean, really what this saying is our relationship with our bodies, yes, definitely sexual immorality

268
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,920
 is a no-no.

269
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:16,960
 But then there's all these other self-controlled disciplines that we must have.

270
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,500
 And a few weeks ago, I think I was guilty of it.

271
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,220
 I was talking to you about my candy crush issue, right?

272
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
 We've solved that.

273
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,040
 We've solved that over these few weeks.

274
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:34,180
 And so I was quite encouraged because that week, Bonnie, who went out with a whole bunch

275
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:39,600
 of you guys to dinner, purposely text me and said, "Hey, you know, that night we ordered

276
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
 extra vegetables."

277
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,960
 And I was like, "Awesome."

278
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,040
 I mean, even just doing that, you know?

279
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:56,040
 I mean, the Lord tells us what he wants us to do is to keep our body holy because the

280
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,220
 Holy Spirit lives inside of us.

281
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,100
 And we want our body to be able to serve God, right?

282
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,580
 To the best that we can.

283
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,580
 Now this isn't here to shame anybody.

284
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,100
 You know, I sleep late, you know, sometimes.

285
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
 Wait, when was the last time I exercised?

286
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,100
 Okay.

287
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,320
 Actually, not too long.

288
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,160
 I think a month ago, a month ago, I was still floating in the water.

289
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:27,520
 But you know what this is, is, you know, collectively, we're not here to condemn anybody, but we're

290
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,540
 saying, "Hey, let's take this into matter, to our heart.

291
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,180
 Let's try to progress, you know?

292
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,680
 Let's just try to do a little bit more because that honors God."

293
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,100
 And so our relationship with our body needs to be holy.

294
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:53,020
 So if you're sleeping at 1.59 a.m., try like 1.45, you know?

295
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,500
 All right.

296
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,100
 I hear you guys.

297
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,180
 The bar's too low now, right?

298
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,180
 Okay.

299
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,180
 Maybe like 12.30?

300
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,180
 Okay.

301
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,180
 Now it's like, "Oh, it's getting harder."

302
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
 All right.

303
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,740
 Well, whatever it is that you set, okay?

304
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,740
 Because when you do that, you know who gets the honor?

305
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,300
 God does.

306
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:20,140
 Because through the Holy Spirit helping you, you are actually making your body into a holy

307
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,800
 temple for God.

308
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,420
 So let us on, for those who love ice cream.

309
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,780
 All right, let's not go there.

310
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,780
 All right.

311
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,460
 Shall we keep going?

312
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,100
 All right.

313
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:40,100
 So as we read, we're going to look at the third kind of relationship, which is our marital

314
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,940
 status, rather that is married or single.

315
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,260
 This will be in the chapter seven.

316
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:56,460
 Chapter seven, we notice that Paul turns attention to married life, but it also tells us about

317
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,540
 being single.

318
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,760
 So Apostle Paul tells us that both husband and wife's body do not belong to themselves.

319
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,940
 So the very first thing is our body belongs to the Lord, but if you're married, then your

320
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,220
 body also belongs to your spouses.

321
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,180
 And sexual relations within that context is good and should not be deprived so that Satan

322
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,380
 will not tempt them.

323
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,900
 And so as we read on in verse, that's the verse one to seven, what I've just summarized.

324
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,380
 So now we're going to read eight and following a few verses together.

325
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:40,540
 So in verse eight, it says, "Now to the unmarried and the widows, I say this, it is good for

326
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,340
 them to stay unmarried as I do.

327
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,140
 But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry, for it is better to marry than

328
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,140
 to burn with passion."

329
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,860
 Now this one is a tricky one, you know, Paul speaks as if you can get married whenever

330
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,460
 it is that you want to.

331
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,340
 And we all know that it's not quite the case.

332
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,780
 Because you got to find someone suitable, right?

333
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,580
 You don't just go, "Oh, I think you're okay.

334
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,460
 All right, we'll take this one."

335
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,020
 You can't do that, right?

336
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,580
 But it makes it sound like it can.

337
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,220
 And that's where it's mind boggling.

338
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,220
 So how does this work?

339
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,400
 Well, I think, you know, he's really trying to tell us to be faithful.

340
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,580
 So if you're burning with passion, you got to help yourself to not.

341
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:30,180
 Now of course, finding someone suitable would be good if you would like to get married.

342
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:37,700
 But even if you can't, don't let that passion just run all over the place and do anything

343
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,740
 that is against the Lord, but instead stay faithful to him.

344
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,780
 And in here, I mean, I don't have a solution.

345
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,420
 I don't know how to live this one out, honestly.

346
00:21:50,420 --> 00:22:00,180
 But we do know that he's asking us to be faithful, to not let anything to overcome us, but to

347
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:06,540
 overcome even the burning passion with ways that will be faithful to God.

348
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,700
 Now as Paul continues to talk about the married people back in verse 10 now, it says, "To

349
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:17,700
 the married, I give this command, not I, but the Lord, a wife must not separate from her

350
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,100
 husband.

351
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,980
 But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband.

352
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,060
 And a husband must not divorce his wife."

353
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,020
 Now Paul clearly here tells wives not to separate from her husband.

354
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:41,320
 But interestingly enough, right the next line, he says, "But if she does."

355
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,840
 So what does that tell us?

356
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,760
 It tells us that it's possible that in some instances or circumstances, maybe physical

357
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,760
 or emotional abuse or adultery or other circumstances, that they need to separate.

358
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:05,040
 But it only says kind of for a while, leaving that door of reconciliation possible, because

359
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:10,040
 in no way does it say that they should divorce.

360
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:16,360
 Now when we hear this, I want to put a disclaimer on, because maybe some of us here or even

361
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,440
 online watching are divorced.

362
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,520
 And this is not meant to make you feel guilty or shamed in any way, because we do understand

363
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,800
 that Paul is trying to give us a guideline, but it's impossible for him to list out every

364
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,400
 single situation.

365
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:44,520
 But what we do know that is that God has enough grace to meet us where we are.

366
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:52,840
 And yet he still tells us kind of the basic guideline and principles of what God's heart

367
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,660
 is and what he desires.

368
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:01,960
 But we do understand that there's all these brokenness and sinfulness in life.

369
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,600
 So for anybody who has gone through divorce, this is not meant to be a condemnation.

370
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:15,880
 And we want to just tell you that, that life is hard and relationships are hard, and people

371
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:23,000
 who are broken or sinful and will not repent, and that might include ourselves as well,

372
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,940
 will make it even harder.

373
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:33,620
 So this is just Paul telling us his guidelines to help us to understand God's heart.

374
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,640
 And so what we see here, we should really just try our best to work.

375
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:44,180
 But we always know that relationships takes at least, well, I mean, talk about marital

376
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,980
 here, so two people, two.

377
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:53,460
 And so we try our best to do our parts, and that's, we'll honor God.

378
00:24:53,460 --> 00:25:00,440
 And so as we read further in verse 12, it says, "To the rest, I say this.

379
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,060
 If any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must

380
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,800
 not divorce her.

381
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:13,420
 And if a woman who has a husband who is not a believer and he's willing to live with her,

382
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,340
 she must not divorce him.

383
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:20,980
 For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife, and the unbelieving wife

384
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,500
 has been sanctified through her believing husband.

385
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,900
 Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.

386
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,260
 But if the unbeliever leaves, let it be so.

387
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,720
 The brother or sister is not bound in such circumstances.

388
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,060
 God has called us to live in peace.

389
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:43,400
 How do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband?

390
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,780
 Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?"

391
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,620
 Now here we see a situation where one of them are a believer, and it does not say whether

392
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:58,180
 when they got married, if that was already the case or if someone has converted afterwards.

393
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:06,340
 But what we do see is that the Lord is still asking the people, "If you can stay together,

394
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,660
 stay together."

395
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:14,380
 Only in the case where the non-believer wants to leave, well, there's very little or maybe

396
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,500
 nothing you can do about it.

397
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,420
 Again, this is looking inwards.

398
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,580
 You just try your best.

399
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,660
 You cannot control the outcome, but that's what we need to do.

400
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,340
 This brings us to our third point, that rather you're married or rather you're single, we

401
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,740
 need to remain faithful to God.

402
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:41,060
 I think it's not possible for the Bible to write out every single situation in your home,

403
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,060
 right?

404
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,300
 You can't say, "Oh, but he said that, but she did this, so now what should we do?

405
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,380
 Is there a protocol for it?"

406
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:55,100
 There's no way any book will have all of the scenarios, right?

407
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,940
 No combination at all.

408
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,260
 But he's telling us, "What do we need to do?

409
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,540
 Be faithful.

410
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,900
 Be faithful."

411
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:10,220
 And just doing our parts in this relationship is what's called of us.

412
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:16,300
 Now, personal relationships are hard, as we have established at the very beginning, all

413
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,300
 right?

414
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,260
 And even after this sermon, it hasn't gone easier, has it?

415
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,260
 Okay?

416
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,260
 You're not going to walk in and say, "All right, all my problems are solved."

417
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:33,820
 But what we do know is that if we were to do what we said, to be sinless in front of

418
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:40,180
 our brothers and sister, to do good when they do evil to us, well, not evil, but maybe just

419
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,340
 disputes.

420
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:52,140
 Or rather it is that we have our bodies that we need to be holy to, or with our relationship,

421
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,860
 marital status, to be faithful in those situation.

422
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:01,800
 What we realize is we can't do it ourselves.

423
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,820
 Even if we know, "Okay, I'm supposed to be faithful.

424
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,860
 I'm supposed to be holy."

425
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,660
 How do we then do this?

426
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,580
 And that is through Holy Spirit.

427
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,740
 That is the only way we can do it.

428
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,980
 And how is it that we can invite Holy Spirit to help us?

429
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,780
 Pray.

430
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,860
 Thank you.

431
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,860
 We need to pray.

432
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,740
 You're like, "Oh, well, I've heard of this before."

433
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,740
 Yes, well, you're in a church, so I'm sure it's not the first time you've heard that

434
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,420
 we need to pray.

435
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,860
 But actually prayer changes everything.

436
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,740
 Okay, everybody say this, "Prayer changes everything."

437
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,740
 One, two, three.

438
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,740
 - Prayer changes everything.

439
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,700
 - All right, I need more conviction on that.

440
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,180
 One, two, three.

441
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,140
 - Prayer changes everything.

442
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,940
 - And prayers do change everything.

443
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,460
 You know, Martin Luther, he's very famous for what?

444
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,540
 Praying, okay?

445
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,540
 He's all about praying.

446
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,340
 He says the more work he has to do, the more he has to pray.

447
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:14,820
 And he prays for three hours, which I don't know how that works, three hours.

448
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:21,700
 And what we realize, actually what I realize is the more relational issues that we have,

449
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,460
 you know what we should do?

450
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,300
 The more prayers we should have.

451
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,580
 Because God's gonna help us be faithful, be holy.

452
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,340
 He's gonna be the one that actually changes.

453
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:38,780
 Us, the other person, or the situation.

454
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:43,460
 And so, you know, I really wanna encourage all of us, that includes myself as well.

455
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,980
 You know, for those of you, I won't get a raise of hand for this.

456
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,180
 For those of you who pray for one minute, I wanted to say put your hand up, but don't,

457
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,740
 don't, don't.

458
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
 Okay?

459
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:59,660
 For those of us who pray for one minute, I wanna challenge all of you, all of us.

460
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,980
 What about praying for five minutes?

461
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,940
 Or if you say, "Oh, that might be a bit challenging."

462
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,100
 Okay, two minutes.

463
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,280
 And for those of us who have been praying for 15 minutes a day, rather that includes

464
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:19,740
 your meal prayers or not, what about a 20 minute or a 30 minute prayer?

465
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,940
 And you're like, "Wait a minute, is this about the length of our prayer?

466
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,380
 Is it about the length?"

467
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,380
 Then what is it?

468
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,100
 It's not talking about time then.

469
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,660
 It's talking about our dedication to God.

470
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,780
 It's talking about whether we prioritize Him.

471
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:43,820
 It's talking about whether or not we actually believe that He's gonna be doing something

472
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,980
 in that person's life, in our lives, or in our circumstances.

473
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,580
 And when we put God first, we're gonna see things change.

474
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,580
 Prayer changes everything.

475
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,580
 Can we say that again?

476
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
 One, two, three.

477
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,580
 - Prayer.

478
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,580
 - Prayer changes everything.

479
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,580
 I love being up here.

480
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,060
 I was thinking, "Mig, you guys do anything, right?"

481
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,780
 But prayers do change everything.

482
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,420
 And so I just...

483
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,900
 Like what Pastor John said earlier, I don't want us to walk out like, "Oh, it's another

484
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,380
 nice service.

485
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,620
 I hope you find it nice."

486
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:25,420
 Rather, we go out and say, "All right, I've been praying very little, or maybe I've been

487
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,060
 praying some, but let me really put that up front.

488
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:37,800
 Let me really ask God to change our personal relationships, change us.

489
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:48,260
 Really ask us to allow God to help us to surrender ourselves so that all that is left is God."

490
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,300
 Amen.

491
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,540
 It's gonna be a journey between all of us and all of God.

492
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:00,180
 But let's move together as a church, okay?

493
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,540
 Wherever you are in that spectrum, let's move towards all of God.

494
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,140
 You want that?

495
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,140
 - Yeah.

496
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,140
 - Yeah.

497
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,140
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

498
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
 You want that?

499
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,140
 - Yeah.

500
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,180
 - Yeah, thank you.

501
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,380
 So let us pray together, asking God to help us.

502
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:22,420
 Our personal relationships, God did not make personal relationships to torture us.

503
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:27,020
 He made it so we could enjoy that fellowship.

504
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,860
 And so let us pray together.

505
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:38,160
 Dear Heavenly Father, thank you so much for giving us brothers and sisters.

506
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:44,340
 Thank you for giving us this body that we can walk around and we can do many things

507
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,340
 with.

508
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:53,500
 And thank you for giving us, if we do have a spouse or even if we're by ourselves, this

509
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:59,740
 opportunity to just enjoy the life that you have given us.

510
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:06,420
 And yet, Father, we know that our bodies, all of us, do not belong to ourselves, that

511
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,780
 we belong to you.

512
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,660
 And Father, we pray that we can surrender ourselves to you.

513
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:20,500
 That may your Holy Spirit every day transforms us, changes us, so that we really live a life

514
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:28,360
 where we can say that this body does not belong to me.

515
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,620
 These relationships, I submit them to you.

516
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:41,020
 So Father, help us with your Holy Spirit filling us up, changing us day by day, maybe from

517
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:46,940
 simple things like the way we eat, the way we sleep, the way we talk, to the way we pray,

518
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,580
 to the way we read the Bible.

519
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:57,060
 Father, I pray that you help our church to grow one step at a time, not with our own

520
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,500
 efforts, but with your Holy Spirit.

521
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,940
 We pray all these in Jesus' name.

522
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,740
 Amen.
