[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   Good evening everyone, good to see you all.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.680]   Hello everyone online, we miss you, we hope you're well and I hope to see you soon.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.920]   We started this series on the church together and I absolutely love this series.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.880]   So much has happened in Hong Kong in these last few years, right?
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.040]   And I truly believe the Lord is doing something to the church.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.720]   A lot of it is pruning, a lot of it is purging, but something's happening.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.200]   And the church, we have to change, we have to evolve in the way that we're doing church.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.780]   We have to think about how are the times changing and how do we reach people with the gospel.
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.100]   But then there's also these things that we really shouldn't change.
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.860]   These things that should remain pillars of what it means to be church, to mean to be
[00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.960]   the ecclesia, which is a gathering of believers, an assembly of believers.
[00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.360]   And John last week gave us this picture of a chair with four legs.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.320]   And these believers, they relied on these four legs.
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.320]   What were they?
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.640]   The apostles' teaching, fellowship, breaking of bread, prayers.
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.940]   And we're going to go through each one today.
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.880]   And the one we're going to go through is, the title I've been given for this is, it's
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.860]   the apostles' teaching, it is a word-rooted church.
[00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.180]   I'm talking about the first one, which is the apostles' teaching.
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.440]   We're talking about the Bible.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.320]   And I'll be honest with you, I've had a really heavy heart preparing this.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.320]   I'm actually very confused.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.960]   I was like, how do I give a sermon about the Bible?
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.960]   How do I convince you?
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.280]   How do I encourage all of us?
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.320]   How do I inspire all of us to read the Bible?
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.160]   And then I thought, you know what?
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.040]   Jesus loves me, this I know for the Bible tells me so.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.360]   And maybe I'll find a clever acronym to help people remember, B-I-B-L-E.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.360]   Maybe that's the one.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.600]   Maybe I'll try and think of a way to help you remember to read the Bible.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.600]   How many of us read the Bible every day?
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.960]   Be proud, be proud, praise God.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.520]   But yet it's so hard, right?
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.160]   Even those of us who read it every day, we realize it's a hard thing to do.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.680]   So then I was on this side thinking, I couldn't think of an acronym, a clever one at least,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.680]   to kind of help you remember.
[00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.600]   Then I saw on the other way, I'm like, you know what?
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.320]   Who am I to convince you about this word?
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.320]   This book is why we're here.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.840]   Everything in this book is the reason that we need, everything is here.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.400]   Why do I even need to say anything?
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.800]   I should just spend the next half an hour reading from the Bible.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.360]   Because we're a word-rooted church, right?
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.480]   And you'll be pleased to know I'm not doing that, that would be lazy.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.760]   You didn't pay to, actually you didn't pay to come here at all.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.720]   But anyway, you didn't come to just see me read the Bible.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.160]   Later, in the second half, I will.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.280]   Because I feel that that's still the best way for us to be convinced about what this
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.520]   word is really about.
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.160]   But before that, I want to preface it, I want to give us a little bit of an introduction
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.760]   as to why this is important.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.120]   Why did the early believers devote, devote, of one mind, focus on the apostles' teaching?
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   What was it about?
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.120]   When did they do it?
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.120]   How did they do it?
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   And why did they do it?
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.760]   So I'll spend the first half really talking about that, helping us understand a little
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.520]   bit about this, and then we will read, we will receive the word of the Lord together.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   Is that good?
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.040]   Okay, so, what is it?
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.520]   It's the apostles' teaching.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.160]   The apostles' teaching is the Bible.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.160]   What is that?
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.040]   I think the best example of this is in Acts 2, where Jesus, in Acts chapter 1, flies off
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.160]   to heaven and he says, "I'll be back."
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.520]   And then chapter 2, the Holy Spirit comes.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.520]   The Holy Spirit comes and then Peter, obnoxious, arrogant Peter, impulsive Peter, suddenly
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.640]   is filled with the Spirit and he stands up.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.880]   And he stands up and he delivers a speech.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.720]   He delivers the speech for the ages.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.520]   It's called a kerygma.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   What is this kerygma?
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520]   You'll see in Acts 2.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.680]   It's not short, but it's basically his first attempt at proclaiming the gospel.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.620]   The kerygma is basically a proclamation of the gospel.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.520]   It's about the life and the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.360]   That would be called the apostles' teaching.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.400]   The apostle Peter, teaching.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.480]   But what was he doing in that kerygma?
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.840]   He was opening up the Word.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.660]   What was he reading in the Word?
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.320]   He was reading the Old Testament.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.520]   Remember, when Peter was preaching, he wasn't preaching from the book of Acts.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.440]   He was the book of Acts.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.800]   The book of Acts is basically the book of the Acts of the apostles.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.280]   That's what it's about.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.000]   So he's looking at the Old Testament.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Now the Old Testament is hard.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.020]   I'll confess, the Old Testament is hard to understand.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.240]   It's hard to read sometimes.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.540]   And yet he was opening the Old Testament.
[00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.880]   He was looking at the book of Joel.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.720]   He was looking at Psalms and he was saying, "Guys, this Old Testament that we've read
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.320]   all of our lives, you know what it's about?
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.280]   It's about Jesus.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.200]   Everything that is prophesied in the Old Testament is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.880]   All the problems of mankind that we see in the Old Testament, and there are plenty, even
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.680]   from the best ones, the solution is in Jesus.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.840]   So he, when he was opening the book, he was looking at the Old Testament and he was saying,
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.760]   "Guys, this here is truth."
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.160]   And it wasn't just the Old Testament.
[00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.780]   Actually in the early church, especially in the first few centuries, they were also reading
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.120]   letters to each other.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.320]   The letters that Paul was writing to the churches, the letters that Peter was writing, the letters
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   that James was writing.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.880]   At the beginning of James it says, "To the twelve tribes in the dispersion," they were
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.040]   writing letters, these epistles, writing them to the church, a gathering just like this.
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.840]   And what would the person do when they gather?
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.280]   They would open up the letter or they would take open the letter and they would read it
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.960]   out to people.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.640]   That would be what they would do.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   That's what it meant when it said they would be devoted to the apostles' teaching.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.120]   It was opening up the word.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.400]   That is really it and that is what it is.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.120]   So when would they like to read it?
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.120]   When?
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.120]   All the time.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.000]   You have to remember something.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.280]   In the Greco-Roman culture at that time, reading was a very important part of culture.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.480]   If you went to a dinner party, if you went to someone's home to have dinner at their
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.640]   place, you would eat and then what would happen?
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.120]   Towards the end of the evening, the host likely would stand up and they would give a reading.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.600]   Those of us who have come from maybe more traditional schools will be very used to this.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.440]   Reading was a big part of culture back then and they wouldn't read the Bible necessarily
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.760]   if they weren't followers of Christ.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.600]   They would read Plato's writings, they would read Homer's writings, but they would read.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.480]   And then Paul was telling the believers here, "Read Scripture."
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.880]   In 1 Timothy 4, he's talking to his mentee, Timothy, who was probably around the same
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.960]   age as I am now, leading his own church in Ephesus, and he was saying in 1 Timothy 4,
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.160]   "Devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture."
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.760]   It's important.
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.760]   Devote yourself to it.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.400]   Do it all the time.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   Colossians 3.16 says, "May the message of Christ dwell among you richly.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.160]   May it surround you."
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.800]   So it was something that was done all the time.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.800]   Why?
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.400]   Because they had this incredibly high regard for Scripture.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.680]   Did you know that it would be considered a serious offence if someone came here and opened
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:20.000]   up the book in the early church and read, but misread some Scripture?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   It would be hugely offensive.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Why?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.220]   Because that was the truth of God.
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.340]   The other reason why is most people couldn't read at that time.
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.620]   Most people didn't have a Bible.
[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:39.200]   And so what was read from the pulpit, what was read in the gathering, was of huge importance
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.240]   because what was being read and what was being listened to, that would be it.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.240]   People didn't have smartphones.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.240]   People didn't have WhatsApp.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.680]   People didn't have, "Oh, I'll send you this article later."
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.680]   None.
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:53.160]   It's basically, "We're all sitting here now and we're all reading and we're receiving
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.280]   the truth together."
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.120]   And this was important because imagine this church here.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.860]   We were an early church gathering.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.700]   Outside there would be persecution happening.
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.180]   We'd have probably had to jump through quite a few hoops, been quite subtle, to get into
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.220]   this place to even gather, to make sure that the authorities outside wouldn't be chasing
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.220]   us.
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.600]   And within the church there was also division.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.080]   People were arguing about truth.
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   People were going, "No, that's not right.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.080]   That's not right."
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.080]   There was Gnosticism happening.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.320]   There was false heresy happening.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.080]   So even within a room like this, there'd be people who were arguing over the truth, which
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:26.780]   is why the first song we sang, the Creed, that's where it came from.
[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.780]   People were like, "You know what?
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.780]   There's been so much arguing.
[00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:29.780]   There's been so much discussion.
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.680]   Let us just write down the things that we actually believe so there is no debate."
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.080]   And so you can see how important it was for people to be devoted to this book, to listening
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.400]   to it, because without it, they would lose their sense of center.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.960]   Do you get that?
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.820]   It provided them with the historical context of what actually happened.
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:53.360]   They didn't have Wikipedia, so it would be from listening that they would find out, they
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.760]   would remember what actually happened.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.040]   It would give them their doctrinal center where they actually knew what they believed.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:06.800]   They were devoted to this communal immersion of Scripture.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.520]   But we've gone very far away from that now, haven't we?
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.680]   I mean, actually, I really treasure the times that we read Scripture here in church, but
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.840]   on the most part, we read the Bible on our own, right?
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.440]   We've transitioned away from the communal immersion of Scripture, and we've gone to
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.440]   read on our own.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.240]   And sometimes, instead of reading the Bible, what do we read?
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.720]   We read devotionals that help us understand the Bible.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.400]   We read books to help to talk about the Bible, right?
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.640]   And has that actually worked?
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.700]   Research shows that not really.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.840]   We don't know the word anymore.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.600]   But yet, this is the most important part.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.800]   John gave us this example of this four-legged chair, and I think it's right, these four
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.800]   pillars of the church.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.400]   I've got another analogy here, which is like a three-legged stool.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.920]   A three-legged stool, and there would be fellowship, there would be breaking of bread, and there
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.200]   would be prayers, and the word would be that.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.320]   Do you know that in those three-legged stools, there'd be that kind of round bar that holds
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.000]   those three legs together?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.880]   I see that's what the Word of God is.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.720]   That it's based on the Word of God that you can have fellowship, that you can have breaking
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.600]   of bread and worship, that you can have prayers.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.800]   It's based on truth, because without this, we have nothing.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.480]   That is how important it is, yet we have strayed so far, so far from it.
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.800]   And the consequences are pretty dire.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.880]   They're pretty serious, both in a private and a public sense of expressing faith.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.360]   Privately, we no longer really know how we fit into the big story.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.360]   Why?
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.480]   Because when we open Scripture, we snack.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:41.720]   Now, it's okay at the very beginning, but later on, you have to start feeding yourself.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   You have to start understanding the bigger story.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:48.400]   What it has done, by us stopping to read Scripture together as a whole, we are now completely
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.940]   unfamiliar with the big story.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.040]   We snack.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.080]   We look at Jeremiah 29, and we write it on a fridge magnet, and we go, "Oh, for I know
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:01.760]   the plans He has for me, to prosper me, and it's going to be all nice and happy for me."
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.640]   We look at Joshua 1.9, "Be strong and courageous, for the Lord your God is with you."
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.720]   I have a lion next to me.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.120]   I can be strong and courageous.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.520]   Psalm 23, "The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.200]   I can lie and just chill by a lake, by still waters, and it's all good for me."
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.960]   John 3.16, "God so loved me that He gave His only Son."
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.840]   Romans 8, "If God can be for me, who can be against me?
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.960]   Nothing can separate me from the love of God."
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.480]   And there, so we snack.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.400]   We take all these things, and we're like, "Oh, it's all about us.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   It's all about us.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   It's all about us."
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.280]   We're snacking, all the while recognizing that we have missed the feast that is this
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.200]   whole story.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:43.720]   And I apologize to you as a shepherd of the flock, as a pastor here.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.000]   I don't think we give this enough justice.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.400]   I rely on my acronyms.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   I rely on my jokes.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.000]   I rely on my stories to help you remember this word, when all I actually really should
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.980]   be doing is showing you this, because this is enough.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.320]   And so what does it mean to be a word-rooted church?
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:08.920]   Is that, do we have the sustained discipline and attention to go through the Word of God,
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:14.520]   recognizing how valuable it is to us, and allowing this to speak for itself?
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:21.760]   And yet so often for church, and us pastors fall guilty of this, we try to entertain you.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:26.680]   Are you not entertained by our singing and dancing and acronyms?
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:32.440]   I'm a big basketball fan, as you know, and I've been watching the NBA playoffs.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.680]   And I don't know who else has been watching the NBA playoffs.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.000]   If you watch a whole game, you are subject to the most incredible entertainment show.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.360]   I don't know if you watch it, there's timeouts, and there's the world's jump rope skipping
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.120]   champion is in the timeout, who's showing you how they can do that.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.320]   And then over here, it's like, oh, the champion of the chin balancing competition, I didn't
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.800]   realize, and he balanced the table on his chin.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.480]   And the whole thing, I was like, wow, this entertainment is incredible.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.480]   It's nonstop.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.280]   You just sit here, just being fed and fed and fed and fed.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.800]   And it's every few seconds, something's happening.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.680]   And I realized, man, are we guilty of that for church?
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:17.160]   That we've trained all of us to just be fed all this stuff and these snacks and these
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.640]   sound bites.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:23.640]   But truth is, when it comes to scripture, there is no shortcut.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.600]   John asked this question just before this, and he said, is Jesus the center?
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.880]   I had another question for myself.
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:40.400]   If suddenly all the Bibles in this church vanished, would we still be able to do church?
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.720]   I asked myself that question.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.000]   And you know what the terrifying thing is?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.840]   I was like, I think we could put on a few great songs, open the doors, have someone
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.200]   come out and give some nice self-help kind of advice.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:57.240]   Like, feel good about yourself, you guys are all loved and treasured.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.480]   I think we could probably get away with running church for quite a long time without the Bible
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:02.480]   at all.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.000]   And that terrifies me, because that's not what we're about.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.720]   And then I posed that question to myself.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.800]   James, if tomorrow you wake up and this Bible, someone stole your Bible, would you be able
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   to still live?
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.920]   Would it change your life at all?
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.480]   So I asked you that question.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:25.080]   If suddenly the Bible app was deleted from your phone and you lost your Bible, would
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.040]   it change your life at all?
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:33.640]   Be honest, you don't need to tell me, just be honest.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.720]   Sometimes I fear it won't change.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.440]   If anything, the only thing that will change is that we'll feel less guilty about not reading
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.440]   the Bible.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:44.280]   Oh, we don't have the Bible anyway, so we don't have to read it.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:50.480]   But if this is really what it is saying it is, Jesus says in Matthew 4,4, "Man shall
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.800]   not live on bread alone, but by the words that come out of the mouth of God."
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.240]   He's saying that the Bible is more important than carbs, more important than bread, more
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.400]   important than fries and spaghetti and pasta.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.400]   But do we treat it as such?
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:08.040]   We eat carbs every day, we eat bread every day, but do we read the Bible every day?
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.320]   So that's what it is, that's when it was read and how it was read, but why was it important?
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:19.280]   Well, I don't know how much more I can tell, but this is the Word of God.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.560]   2 Timothy 3 says, "All Scripture is," what?
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.880]   "breathed out by God."
[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.620]   Just pause for a second.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:37.720]   This book, even Leviticus, is breathed out by God Almighty Himself.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.640]   You know, there's stories around the world where people don't have access to this and
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:46.200]   they are just yearning for it.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.040]   You know, actually the Jewish culture, they were so used to this communal immersion that
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.440]   many communities from a very young age, from when children are six, they would start memorizing
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440]   the Torah.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.440]   Do we know what the Torah is?
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.240]   The Torah is the first five books of the Bible.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.920]   So from six, if you see my daughter running around, she's five years old.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:06.600]   So next year, she's going to the synagogue and she's memorizing the Torah.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   How many of us even know which order the first five books go in?
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   And by the age of ten.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.640]   So Reuben's nine, my older one is nine.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.280]   So next year, when he's ten, he will have memorized the whole Torah.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.240]   The whole thing.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.800]   And yet we've come so far from it.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.080]   This is the Word of God, how valuable it is.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.520]   In England, in our family home, there's a drawer and it's still there.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.960]   There's this old Philips mobile phone.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.880]   We bought it in 2002.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.680]   All other phones, the Nokia 3210s, they're all gone.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.160]   We've passed them on or thrown them or something.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.240]   But this one phone that we keep.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.760]   The screen is about this big.
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.280]   It's blue, it's navy blue.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.600]   It's about this big, a little antenna that comes out and then just the keypad.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.880]   We've kept that phone.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   Why?
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.960]   Because on that phone, it was my mum's phone.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.280]   And a week or two before my dad passed away, he was messaging her and he was messaging
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.880]   her a really lovely, sentimental message.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.600]   And so we've kept it.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   To this day, it's there.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:10.680]   And actually, when we go back home, I'll likely bring it out and have a look at it again.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   Why?
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.160]   Because it is valuable to us.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.280]   Because we recognise, "Man, those were my dad's words.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:22.040]   He typed those words to us, to my mum."
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.080]   And yet we don't hold this in a similar regard.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.220]   This is God's love story for us.
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:33.580]   And yet we spend most of our days just feeling guilty about not reading it and just forcing
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:38.400]   ourselves to read like two verses.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.240]   And then we wonder why we're unfamiliar with the big story.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.400]   When we're surprised that we don't know how to live out our lives in this world right
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:54.760]   now, all Scripture is breathed out by God, profitable for correcting, teaching, rebuking,
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.800]   training, equipping us for every good work.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.320]   That's what 2 Timothy 3 says.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:04.960]   The point of Scripture is that we would be equipped, that we would know how to live in
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.920]   this world, that we would be equipped for every good work.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.200]   Because here's the other problem.
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:11.880]   For those of us who are really good at reading Scripture, that we are just devout to it,
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.880]   we are almost religious in reading Scripture.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.240]   And actually there are some great programmes around.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.440]   BSF is one of them, right?
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.320]   A great way to learn Scripture, even what Johnny was telling us about Ethan.
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.440]   It's a great start, isn't it?
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.440]   Just to learn Scripture.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:29.480]   But you see, when it comes to Scripture, the point of it isn't just to fill our heads with
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.480]   knowledge.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.240]   The Apostle Paul says, "Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.200]   The point is, how do we then use this to be equipped for every good work?
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.960]   How do we use this to show us how to navigate this broken world right now?
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.640]   That is what we're supposed to be using it for.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.320]   Every time we read the Word of God, it demands a response.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.020]   It demands action.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.200]   It demands something in us has to change.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.920]   Because if this is the Word of God, if this is written by the guy who created this world,
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.260]   then we take it seriously.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:05.540]   The book of James says in chapter 122, "Let us be doers of the Word and not just hearers."
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.900]   Because if you say you believe, but you don't do anything with it, if you say you read the
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.620]   Bible, but you don't really respond to it, then your faith is dead.
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:21.180]   Whereas in Hebrews 4.12, it says, "The Word of God is living, is active, sharper than
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.660]   any double-edged sword."
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:23.940]   What can it do?
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:28.100]   It can pierce to the depths of your soul.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:33.620]   If you allow it, if you open your heart when you read this book, it will tell you things
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.860]   about you that even you don't know about yourself.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.900]   And then it will demand a response.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.540]   That is what this book is about.
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.340]   But unfortunately, we rely on self-help tips.
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.120]   We rely on philosophy.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.940]   We rely on sociology.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.740]   We rely on psychology.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.260]   We rely on all these different things when actually everything that we need.
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.820]   Scripture is the only reliable guide for us to navigate this world.
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:07.860]   So my goal today is to hopefully remind us of that.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:11.340]   Remind us of that and encourage us to dive deep into this Word, knowing that it's not
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.020]   easy, but knowing that we are supposed to do it.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.180]   And if you're not finding it easy, or if you don't know the Word, then I apologize to you
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.100]   because then we've done you injustice.
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:25.340]   That you've come into this church family and that we've not been rooted enough in this
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.340]   Word.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:33.020]   And so that's a little bit about Scripture, about the Word of God.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.860]   And I'll move into the second part where we'll actually open up the Word now and we'll read
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.860]   some.
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.700]   Because when we're talking about lacking sustained attention, I realize that I am the worst of
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:40.700]   them all.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.860]   It's really hard to keep going in Scripture.
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.460]   And I'll tell you a little bit, these few months have been really hard, right?
[00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.700]   And a couple of weeks ago I shared about my emotional health, that it's not been great.
[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.420]   And in January, I had that.
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:54.340]   When everything was kicking off, when things were just getting bad, I was telling God,
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:57.300]   "You know what, I'm just so done.
[00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:58.700]   So done with just all of this."
[00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.020]   And I remember going on a retreat with Him and I was just sat there like, "I have nothing
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.140]   to say to you.
[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:05.420]   And you clearly don't really have much to say to me.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:10.580]   So we're just going to sit in silence and we're going to have a staring contest.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.580]   And that's it.
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.580]   It's going to be a good day.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.820]   We'll just leave it at that."
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.980]   I felt compelled to open up His Word.
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.380]   And for the first time, and again, you can judge me for this if you want to, for this
[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:25.580]   first time I read through, actually no, when Christina and I first dated when we were 18
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:29.220]   and 19, we actually read through the whole Bible together, cover to cover, every day.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:32.020]   That was really surprising and impressive.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.660]   I don't remember any of it.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:39.380]   But anyway, because the whole objective was to impress her.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:45.660]   So it worked, right?
[00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.260]   So in January, for the first time ever, we have nothing else to say.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.660]   I just opened up the scripture and I started reading.
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:55.180]   And I read through the whole book of Philippians for the first time in one go.
[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:58.060]   And I was like, "I've never done that before."
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.260]   My favorite basketball player, Steph Curry, his favorite verse is Philippians 4.13.
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.460]   "I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.460]   He writes it on his shoes.
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.460]   I know that verse.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.820]   I know a couple of other verses.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:12.600]   But to see it all in one go blew my mind.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.060]   It blew my mind because it changed the way I saw life.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:20.620]   It changed the way I saw everything and I wanted to give you a glimpse of that today.
[00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:28.020]   And I want to ask you, as you hear me read scripture, and we'll pray in a minute before
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.220]   I do it, I want you to notice a few things.
[00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.420]   Paul was writing this letter to the church in Philippi, which is the first ever church
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.500]   in Europe.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:41.880]   He was writing towards the end of his life and he was in prison with no idea whether
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.360]   he would be able to get out this time.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.360]   This could be it.
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:45.360]   He could be done.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.660]   And he's writing to this church there in Philippi and I want you to notice a few things as we
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:51.660]   read it.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.220]   I want you to notice how he yearns for his brothers and sisters, how he just wants to
[00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:57.220]   be with them.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.340]   I want you to notice how he feels about prison, how he feels about life.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.580]   And then we sang a few songs, actually.
[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:09.460]   Well done, Florence, for choosing those songs, where you get to see how Paul perceives the
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.780]   world, the things that are valuable in this world.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.240]   And you get to see how he navigates all that and how he finishes.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.000]   And so I pray as I read through this scripture and that we would absorb this, we would let
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.920]   this Holy Spirit minister to us himself as I open up the Word of God.
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.600]   And I pray, and I will pray now.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.600]   Let's just pray.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:37.920]   Lord, as we open up your Word, as we recognize how valuable it is, that it is breathed out,
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:46.000]   inspired by you, given to us to equip us for every good work, to equip us to show us how
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.800]   to live so we wouldn't just be hearers, but we would be doers.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:57.200]   And I pray that as I read this letter that Paul wrote to Philippi, this letter that really
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:03.260]   speaks into our hearts, this letter is about rejoicing whilst being in prison.
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.400]   May it remind us to find joy whilst living in Hong Kong.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:13.560]   And Holy Spirit, I know that we can't even understand your words without you.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.480]   You are the one who reveals, you are the one who teaches the mysteries of God.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:23.000]   And so I thank you that you're here, I welcome you being here, and I pray that as I read
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:31.660]   these words from this precious, precious book, we as a church would be rooted in your teachings
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.560]   and we would be sensitive to your Spirit.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.680]   We thank you, Lord, for this.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.480]   It's in your name we pray.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.480]   Amen.
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.960]   Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:53.080]   at Philippi, to the overseers and deacons, grace to you and peace from God our Father
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.840]   and the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:02.200]   I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:06.520]   making my prayer with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.680]   until now.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:13.960]   And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.440]   at the day of Christ.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:20.280]   I am right to feel this way about you all because I hold you in my heart, for you are
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:26.000]   all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defence and confirmation
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.560]   of the gospel.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:34.440]   For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.440]   And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:45.120]   so that you may approve what is excellent and be pure and blameless at the day of Christ,
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:50.600]   that you'd be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:52.780]   So the glory and praise of God.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.960]   I want you to know brothers, what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.200]   so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.800]   my imprisonment is for Christ.
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   And most of the brothers, having become confident by my imprisonment, are much more bold to
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.880]   speak the word without fear.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:18.680]   Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, others out of goodwill.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:22.920]   The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defence of the gospel.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:30.280]   The former proclaim Christ from envy, selfish ambition, not sincerely but thinking to afflict
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.560]   me in my imprisonment.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.200]   What then?
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:40.480]   Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed.
[00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.240]   And in that, I rejoice.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:46.600]   Yes, I will rejoice for I know that through your prayers and the help of the spirit of
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:53.840]   Jesus Christ, this will turn out for my deliverance as it is my eager expectation and hope that
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:00.360]   I will not at all be ashamed but that with full courage now, Christ as always will be
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:05.320]   honoured in my body, whether by life or by death.
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:12.000]   For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.800]   If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.360]   At which I shall choose, I can't tell.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.320]   I am hard pressed between the two.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:23.320]   My desire is to be with Christ for that is far better.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:28.280]   But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:33.640]   Convinced of this, I know I will remain and continue with you all in your progress and
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:39.320]   joy in the faith so that in me, you would have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.560]   Because of my coming again to you only, let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.560]   of Christ.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:51.040]   So whether I am to come and see or am absent, I may hear of you standing firm in one spirit
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:58.320]   with one mind, striving side by side for the faith of the gospel, not frightened in anything
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.920]   by your opponents.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:04.360]   This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation and that from God.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.760]   For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ, that you would not only believe
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:12.400]   in him but would suffer for his sake.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.360]   Engage in the same conflict that you saw that I had and now hear that I still have.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:26.040]   So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:34.880]   the spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of one mind, having the same
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.600]   love, being in full accord and of one mind.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:44.760]   Do nothing from selfish ambition and conceit but consider others more significant than
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.760]   yourself.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.760]   Let each of you look not only to his own interests but also to the interests of others.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:57.080]   Have this mind among yourselves which is yours in Christ Jesus, who though he was in the
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:03.260]   form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped but emptied himself.
[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.800]   Taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men and being found in human
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:15.280]   form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on the cross.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:21.320]   Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name so
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.240]   that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.460]   and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.360]   To the glory of God the Father.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.920]   For my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now not only as in my presence but much
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:46.680]   more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.460]   For it is God who works in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
[00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:54.560]   Do all things without grumbling or disputing so that you'll be blameless and innocent,
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:00.640]   children of God without blemish in the midst of this crooked and twisted generation among
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:07.360]   whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life so that in the day
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.880]   of Christ that I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labour in vain.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.000]   Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.120]   I am glad and rejoice with you all.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.960]   Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.480]   I hope in the Lord to send Timothy to you soon so that I may rejoice at hearing about
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:34.600]   you, for I have no one like him who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare, for
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.200]   they all seek their own interests and not of Jesus Christ.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.680]   But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father he served with me in
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.320]   the gospel.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.520]   I hope therefore to send him to you just as soon as I see how it will go with me, and
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.240]   I hope in the Lord that I shortly can come also.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.760]   I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and my fellow worker and my fellow
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.400]   soldier, your messenger and minister to my need.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.520]   Fear has been longing for you all, but he has been distressed because you heard he was
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.520]   ill.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.320]   Indeed he was ill, near to death.
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.760]   But God had mercy on him, but not only on him, but also on me, lest I should have sorrow
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.800]   upon sorrow.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.200]   And the more eager therefore to send him to you, so that you may rejoice at seeing him
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:20.240]   again and that I may be less anxious.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.240]   So receive him in the Lord with all joy.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:30.560]   And he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.080]   in your service to me.
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:35.640]   Bear with me, we're here, we're halfway through.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.000]   Finally brothers, rejoice in the Lord.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.980]   To write the same things to you is of no trouble to me and is safe for you.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:47.800]   Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh,
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.980]   for we are the circumcision who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.200]   and put no confidence in the flesh.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.520]   Though I myself actually have reason for confidence in the flesh also.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:03.960]   If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.560]   Circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:15.560]   of Hebrews, as to the law, a Pharisee, as to the righteousness, a zeal, a persecutor
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.920]   of the church, as to righteousness under the law, blameless.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.780]   But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:29.460]   Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.660]   Jesus my Lord.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.560]   For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.100]   that I may gain Christ and be found in him.
[00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:43.220]   Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:49.180]   faith in Christ, a righteousness of God that depends on faith, that I may know him and
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:53.660]   the power of his resurrection, may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.820]   and by any means possible attaining the resurrection from the dead.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:02.020]   Not that I've already obtained this or I'm already perfect, but I press on to make it
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.860]   my own because Christ Jesus made me his own.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.580]   Stop.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:16.420]   Brothers, I don't consider I've made it my own, but one thing I do.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:21.340]   Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.700]   the goal for the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:29.060]   Let those of us who are mature think this way and if anything you think otherwise, let
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:30.500]   God reveal that also to you.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.900]   Only let us hold true to what we have attained.
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.500]   Brothers, join in imitating me and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.900]   that you have in us.
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:45.340]   For many, as I've often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.700]   cross of Christ.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.980]   Their end is destruction.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.300]   Their God is their belly.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:51.860]   Their glory in their shame.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:57.140]   Their minds set on earthy things, but our citizenship is in heaven and from it we await
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:02.660]   a saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.100]   body by the power that enables him to subject all things to himself.
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:13.340]   Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord,
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:14.340]   my beloved.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.980]   I entreat you Odier and Sintek to agree in the Lord.
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:21.540]   Yes, I also ask you, help these women who have laboured side by side with me in the
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.140]   gospel together with Clement and the rest of the fellow workers whose names are in the
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.140]   book of life.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:28.100]   You recognise this, Peter?
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:29.100]   Rejoice in the Lord.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.100]   Again, I will say rejoice.
[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:34.900]   Let your reasonableness be known to everyone.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:36.900]   The Lord is at hand.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:42.220]   Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:47.300]   let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.900]   will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:59.780]   Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honourable, whatever is just, whatever
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:06.140]   is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is anything of excellence,
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:10.860]   if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.540]   What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practise these things and
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.860]   the God of peace will be with you.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.540]   I rejoice greatly now that you have revived your concern for me.
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.540]   At length.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.500]   You were indeed concerned, but you had no opportunity.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.540]   Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned that in whatever situation
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:30.580]   I am to be content.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.340]   I know how to be brought low.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.620]   I know how to abound.
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:40.580]   In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:41.580]   and need.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:46.580]   I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.340]   Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble.
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:54.660]   And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel when I left Macedonia
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:59.260]   no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only.
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:06.020]   Even in Thessalonica you sent help for my needs.
[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.020]   And I am well supplied.
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.860]   I have received full payment and more, having received from Epaphroditus the gift that you
[00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:16.500]   sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:21.940]   And my God will supply every need of yours according to the riches of his glory in Christ
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:27.700]   Jesus, to our God the Father be glory forever and ever.
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.700]   Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.860]   All the brothers who are with me greet you.
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.780]   All the saints greet you.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.500]   May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.460]   This is the word of the Lord.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.460]   Amen.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:51.660]   I don't know how you found that.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.980]   It may have been hard.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.580]   It may have allowed you to start nodding off.
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:57.220]   And that's okay.
[00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:00.020]   It really is.
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.780]   But don't stay here.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.200]   Don't stay where you are right now.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.620]   Don't navigate this world without this.
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.700]   Hang on it's every word.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:11.700]   Push your church.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.700]   Push me.
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.700]   Push John.
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:14.700]   Push Johnny.
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.700]   Push Michelle.
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.060]   To open up the word of God to you.
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:21.200]   Because this is the only reliable guide.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:27.900]   This is the only thing that we can hang on in this dark world where truth is going missing.
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:32.580]   And brothers and sisters we have this truth right here on our apps.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.580]   In multiple apps.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:39.180]   But I don't want to finish us there and just leave it there.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:46.260]   If you feel that actually you want to do more with the Bible but you just don't know where
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:52.980]   to start I want to give you some handles just to hold on to.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:59.460]   The Apostle Peter was a changed man in Acts 2 before he delivered the gospel.
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.460]   Why?
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.460]   Because of the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.240]   So if you're thinking what do I need to do to read the Bible?
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.240]   To understand the Bible?
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.340]   I encourage you.
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.340]   The first thing is this.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.500]   There's actually two people you need to talk to.
[00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.500]   Okay?
[00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.180]   Let's just leave with two action points here.
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:17.300]   Number one, talk to the Holy Spirit.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:18.880]   Pray to him.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:23.540]   Every time you open up his word just go, "I'm lost with this.
[00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.820]   I'm confused with this book."
[00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:30.620]   If you're real and if this is truth, show me.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:34.440]   Number one, pray to the Holy Spirit and ask him to open this up to you.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:40.460]   Number two, find someone real like human flesh right next to you.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.460]   Read it together.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.900]   We are a word rooted church.
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:48.020]   We're supposed to open up the word of God together.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.180]   We're supposed to devote ourselves to the public teaching of scripture.
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.380]   So find one person.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.900]   That's all you need.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.560]   One person and say, "You know what?
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:05.360]   Something happened to me this evening that I think I need this truth."
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.960]   Find that one person and just say, "Can you read with me?
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.420]   Can you hold me accountable?
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:15.980]   Can we just message each other every day and just say, 'Have we read one chapter together?'"
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:22.060]   Whatever it may be, don't let anything stop you because this is truth.
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:25.100]   Because this is what will help you get you through life.
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:28.020]   This is what our church should be based on.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:30.620]   It is what we should be rooted on.
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:31.620]   Amen?
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.620]   Amen.
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.620]   Let's pray.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:54.980]   Father, we come before you and we are just grateful that you would leave us this word.
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.420]   Your word is a lamp to our feet and a light unto our path.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.580]   Your word is like honey on our lips.
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.100]   So use it, Lord.
[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:15.660]   Use it to pierce through the very depths of our souls and use it to equip us for every
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:17.820]   good work.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:25.180]   Forgive us that we neglect it, sometimes mistreat it, sometimes we just forget.
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:30.700]   Lord, we thank you that your grace and your patience abounds.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.340]   And you know that we can't do this on our own.
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:40.100]   So we pray, one, for your Holy Spirit to shine that light unto us when we read, when we go
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:45.340]   through the hard books, when we find things that we don't understand, your Holy Spirit,
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.660]   would you read it with us?
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.420]   Would you open up your word with us?
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:54.900]   And second, Lord, can you bind us together as one?
[00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:01.380]   Would you show us the people that you've placed around us who we can do this with together?
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.940]   We're not supposed to do this on our own.
[00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:06.540]   We are supposed to be a church together.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:14.220]   And so Lord, we plead, we pray that we would be a church that is rooted in your word.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:16.260]   In your name I pray, amen.
