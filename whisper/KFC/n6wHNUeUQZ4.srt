1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
 Thank you, Bonnie, and thank you to the worship team.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,280
 That was amazing today.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,120
 Well done.

4
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:10,380
 What I'm gonna say actually pains me,

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,400
 deeply.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,000
 I've been involved in church leadership for around 40 years,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,760
 and yet the biggest conflicts that I've witnessed

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,440
 in churches across the world,

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,080
 the thing that has caused more arguments

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,640
 and caused most collateral damage

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,640
 is worship in church.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:47,200
 Ironically, that the very thing that should be uniting us

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,800
 has often turned into what I call worship wars.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,800
 And I'm not just talking about worship wars.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,080
 I'm talking about worship wars

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,880
 that are not just about the church,

17
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,200
 but about the world.

18
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,200
 And I'm not just talking about worship wars,

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,040
 but about the world.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
 I'm talking about worship wars

21
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,520
 that are not just about the church,

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,360
 but about the world.

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,440
 And I'm not just talking about worship wars,

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,280
 but about the world.

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,560
 I'm talking about worship wars

26
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,920
 that are not just about the church,

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,760
 but about the world.

28
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,640
 And I'm not just talking about worship wars,

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,480
 but about the world.

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,720
 For the Father is seeking such people to worship Him.

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,440
 God is spirit,

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,440
 and those who worship Him must worship in spirit

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,800
 and in truth.

34
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:46,240
 But what is in spirit and truth?

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,920
 Is it a certain style of music,

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,320
 dress, and/or liturgy?

37
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,760
 Is it the proper religious heritage

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,960
 or denominational affiliation?

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,440
 Only in the last couple of weeks,

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,120
 I heard someone suggesting

41
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,320
 that we should not be singing songs

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,960
 that were written by a Catholic author.

43
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,640
 Is it a required level of biblical knowledge?

44
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,920
 We just sang "The Heart of Worship,"

45
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
 and Yang, you sang so beautifully,

46
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,640
 a song by Matt Redmond.

47
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,480
 What I wanna share tonight is the story behind that song.

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,800
 There's a church in the UK, Soul Survivor Church.

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,520
 It began its ministry in 1993.

50
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,160
 It's just outside London

51
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,280
 and was at the forefront of what we call modern worship.

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,320
 They had innovative weekend services,

53
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,160
 worship arts productions,

54
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,160
 and active use of multimedia were all incorporated

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,880
 to make church so-called relevant

56
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,880
 to people's lives and their needs.

57
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,520
 But even with all of this,

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,760
 somehow over time,

59
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,720
 congregation members turned

60
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,320
 from active worship participants

61
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,720
 to silent connoisseurs.

62
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,480
 Something amidst the music and the further was missing.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,920
 The lines got blurred

64
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,200
 and the heart of worship and praise was missing.

65
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,680
 It was at this moment

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,680
 that the pastor of Soul Survivor Church took drastic action.

67
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,400
 Mike Pilavachi removed everything from the worship services.

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,360
 There were no microphones, no drums, no guitars,

69
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,960
 no sound systems, they were all gone.

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,440
 Sundays had no worship leader.

71
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,840
 There were no instruments or amplified sound.

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,880
 Can you imagine it?

73
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,720
 The attendees of this Watford Church couldn't at first,

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,240
 but they had much more than powerful sound systems

75
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,040
 and eye-catching multimedia.

76
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,600
 They had their voices and their hearts.

77
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,240
 And as soon as their voices were lifted together to God,

78
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,320
 as soon as their hearts were united in prayer,

79
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,040
 the silence disappeared

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,640
 and the period of apathy was demolished.

81
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,480
 Step by step, the equipment was returned.

82
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,360
 But since then, it has never played a more important role

83
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,840
 than people's voices.

84
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,720
 Their worship pastor at the time

85
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,280
 was a man called Matt Redmond.

86
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,520
 And he wrote the heart of worship

87
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,920
 during these unusual worship sessions.

88
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,400
 It was just his personal reflection

89
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,520
 of what was happening around him.

90
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,840
 All the staff that was forming the story behind the song

91
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,320
 and the result is the song we know.

92
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,240
 When the music fades, all is stripped away.

93
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,200
 And I simply come, longing just to bring something

94
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,240
 that is worth or bless your heart.

95
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,200
 I'm coming back to the heart of worship.

96
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,160
 And it's all about you.

97
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,440
 It's all about you, Jesus.

98
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:49,800
 The heart of worship is also about self-examination,

99
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,960
 not only in matters of worship, but in our lives.

100
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:02,800
 Jesus came into the world to build a people

101
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,680
 who would be true worshipers.

102
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,520
 In the reading that Bonnie read,

103
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,000
 and Bonnie read superbly, amazing.

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,360
 We saw the Pharisees rejecting the one

105
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,080
 who called out to them.

106
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,640
 Jesus said, "These people honour me with their lips,

107
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,160
 "but their heart is far from me.

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
 "In vain do they worship me,

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,600
 "teaching as doctrines the commandments of men."

110
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:36,600
 Even Simon Peter failed to grasp exactly

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,320
 what was the heart of worship.

112
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,680
 We read in verse 15,

113
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,680
 "Peter said to him, 'Explain the parable to us.'

114
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,240
 "And he," that's Jesus, said,

115
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,080
 "Are you also still without understanding?"

116
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,960
 You see, tradition is something external,

117
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,200
 while God's truth is internal, it's in the heart.

118
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,920
 People can obey tradition to please men and gain status,

119
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:15,160
 but we obey the word of God to please God.

120
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,520
 Tradition deals with ritual,

121
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,720
 while God's truth deals with reality.

122
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,040
 Tradition brings empty words to the lips,

123
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,040
 but truth penetrates the heart and changes the life.

124
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,160
 Actually, tradition potentially robs a person

125
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,680
 of the power of the word of God.

126
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,120
 And this incident with the religious leaders

127
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,600
 and the disciples is particularly significant

128
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,400
 as it sets up what happens next.

129
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,040
 And Jesus, Jesus takes radical action.

130
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
 We read here,

131
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,880
 "And Jesus went away from there

132
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,880
 "and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon."

133
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,640
 You'll see from the map I put on the screen,

134
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,640
 he leaves the Galilee area and goes northwest

135
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:22,560
 to the coastal areas of Tyre and Sidon in modern day Lebanon.

136
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,040
 Tyre was about 35 miles walk from Capernaum.

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,520
 And Sidon was a 50 mile walk.

138
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,840
 Maybe this took two or three days.

139
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,240
 This is actually very significant.

140
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,880
 It is the only time during Jesus' public ministry

141
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,040
 that he steps into strictly Gentile territory.

142
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,280
 Not only did Jesus teach that no foods were unclean,

143
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,660
 but he practiced this teaching

144
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,660
 by going into Gentile territory, the non-Jews.

145
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:14,160
 And he was also seeking to refresh himself

146
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,280
 from the increasing conflicts,

147
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,120
 especially with the religious people,

148
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,720
 and to withdraw a bit from the large crowds

149
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,280
 that had started following him.

150
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,280
 And as he withdrew to a place of solitude,

151
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:36,280
 he actually meets a woman with a true heart of worship.

152
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:45,480
 He meets a woman with a true heart of worship.

153
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,920
 Now Mark 7 24 tells us

154
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,120
 that Jesus was trying to remain hidden,

155
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,120
 but somehow this Canaanite woman heard where he was

156
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,580
 and came to him with her needs.

157
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,600
 But she wasn't what you'd expect.

158
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,440
 She didn't tick all the boxes.

159
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,340
 She wasn't baptised, confirmed, leading a small group,

160
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,520
 pillar of the church, studying for a theology degree,

161
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,840
 none of the above.

162
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:27,240
 And one writer has been led to say this,

163
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,040
 "There is no incident in our Lord's earthly ministry

164
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,980
 that's more puzzling than this."

165
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,260
 And so it begs investigation.

166
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,800
 I mean, look at her entrance.

167
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,360
 And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out

168
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,120
 and was crying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, son of David.

169
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,340
 My daughter is severely oppressed by a demon."

170
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:02,200
 She begins with a plea for mercy.

171
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,180
 The cry, "Lord, have mercy."

172
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,240
 In Greek, that's Kyrie Eleison,

173
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,200
 has been described as the most prayed prayer

174
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,360
 in the whole Bible.

175
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,880
 (audience laughing)

176
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,880
 Notice also, she calls Jesus the son of David.

177
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,640
 Wow, a messianic term.

178
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:35,420
 Coming from the lips of a Gentile, a non-Jew.

179
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,840
 She was clearly convinced of the person

180
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,040
 that she was addressing.

181
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,280
 But let's press in.

182
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,600
 "Note the significance of this.

183
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,600
 Have mercy on me, O Lord, me."

184
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,520
 I mean, after all, it was her daughter

185
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,320
 who was demon possessed,

186
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,440
 but it is the mom who feels the weight,

187
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,860
 the fear, the despair, the hopelessness.

188
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,760
 Any parent who's had troublesome teenagers,

189
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,800
 I'm one of them, will identify with this.

190
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,000
 And of course, she was warmly welcomed

191
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,600
 by Jesus and disciples.

192
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,400
 Not, no way, Jose.

193
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:35,360
 Indeed, their response was underwhelming, to say the least.

194
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,880
 Let's read it.

195
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,200
 "But he," that's Jesus, "did not answer a word.

196
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,820
 And his disciples," I love these guys,

197
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,480
 "came and begged him, saying, 'Send her away.

198
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,800
 She is crying out after us.'"

199
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,960
 Now this really throws us off balance.

200
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,920
 When Paul told us last week about Jairus

201
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,720
 pleading for his little girl,

202
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,360
 Jesus immediately takes steps to come to her aid.

203
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,220
 Now this woman comes to Jesus

204
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,500
 to seek mercy for her daughter,

205
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,420
 and Jesus seemingly ignores her.

206
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:18,100
 And the disciples begin with a hostile attack.

207
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,980
 "Send her away.

208
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,580
 She's not one of us."

209
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,780
 A marginalised woman

210
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:32,640
 becoming even further marginalised.

211
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,720
 Church, there's a practical outworking for us.

212
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,620
 When we come to church,

213
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,600
 we like to talk to our friends, don't we?

214
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,520
 Or with the dudes who are cool and popular.

215
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:52,760
 But how do we react when it is a street sleeper,

216
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,360
 an asylum seeker, a domestic helper, or an LGBT member?

217
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,120
 Or someone from another generation?

218
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,760
 Or of a different colour?

219
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:10,680
 It begs a serious question.

220
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,400
 How does it feel when you are talking with someone

221
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,740
 and that person ignores you?

222
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,760
 And to take it up a notch, how does that feeling change

223
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,960
 when you factor in the importance

224
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,760
 of the person you are talking to?

225
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,300
 And when you talk to God about things,

226
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,680
 does it ever seem as if He's ignoring you?

227
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,720
 Does that feel wonderful?

228
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,760
 I don't think so.

229
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,860
 This woman is not just passing the time.

230
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,200
 She is not commenting on the weather or the Hang Seng Index.

231
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,520
 She has a demon-possessed daughter.

232
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,560
 I mean, she needs help.

233
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,200
 And the person who can help her is standing in front of her.

234
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,640
 As Jesus' fame had grown,

235
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:13,000
 people from all over the region were drawn to Him

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,580
 for help and rescue.

237
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,040
 She'd obviously heard these stories

238
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,440
 and fuelled by the anguish for her daughter,

239
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,320
 comes to Jesus and bears her soul to Him.

240
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,120
 I want you to picture the scene.

241
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,560
 It's a bit like a Hong Kong traffic accident.

242
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,800
 You know, when someone like scrapes someone else's car,

243
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,680
 it's a little scrape, and they're in the middle of the road

244
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,880
 and one's shouting at someone,

245
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,400
 "Why don't you learn to drive properly?"

246
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,680
 And the other one goes, "Lay out more, go out, oh!"

247
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,200
 You know, like this is happening.

248
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,400
 And here we've got it.

249
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,040
 The mom is by now shouting her head off.

250
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,720
 And the disciples were also having their five pennies worth.

251
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,760
 On the other hand,

252
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,880
 Jesus was silently standing in the eye of the storm.

253
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,400
 Rather like He was on the Lake of Galilee

254
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,840
 before He calmed the storm.

255
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,720
 The Canaanite woman must've felt

256
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,120
 like she was being put on hold.

257
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,280
 Nobody likes being put on hold.

258
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,280
 I really detest these so-called hotlines.

259
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,440
 They're not so hot, are they?

260
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,560
 Let's be honest.

261
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,800
 Our lines are very busy.

262
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,160
 Your call is important, so please hold on.

263
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,880
 And one of our customer services representative

264
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,120
 will be with you shortly.

265
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,040
 That's a lie.

266
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,720
 And then you're subjected either to canned music

267
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,040
 or a barrage of advertisements.

268
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,800
 But the dialogue then becomes even more difficult

269
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,160
 to understand.

270
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,960
 Verse 24, He, that's Jesus said,

271
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,960
 "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."

272
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:14,800
 Did Jesus really tell her

273
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:21,000
 that He wouldn't help her because of her ethnicity?

274
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,520
 You know, many of us would grown up

275
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,800
 with churches in the States, in South Africa,

276
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,840
 with signs outside, no blacks allowed, right?

277
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,880
 Do you remember that?

278
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,360
 And no doubt the disciples were cheering in the background.

279
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,840
 This is getting more puzzling by the moment.

280
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,760
 Look at her response.

281
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,760
 Verse 25, "But she came and knelt before Him saying,

282
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,520
 'Lord, help me.'"

283
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,720
 We cannot but admire the patience and persistence

284
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,240
 of this Gentile mother.

285
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,000
 "Lord, help me," was her next plea.

286
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,080
 And this time she avoided any messianic titles.

287
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,840
 She came as a sinner needing help

288
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,280
 and she offered no argument.

289
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,200
 And the phrase that I've been looking for

290
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,840
 ever since I talked about the heart of worship

291
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,640
 has finally arrived.

292
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,560
 "In she came and knelt before Him."

293
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,800
 Matthew, the gospel writer,

294
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,400
 uses an expression used of worship.

295
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,160
 So consider this,

296
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,640
 this woman appears to have been ignored

297
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,240
 and rejected and insulted by Jesus.

298
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,720
 And yet she still comes forward

299
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,120
 and offers her worship to Him.

300
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,960
 Surely now, surely now,

301
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,360
 Jesus will help this woman and her daughter.

302
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,600
 But it gets even more intriguing.

303
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,880
 Try and work this one out.

304
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,200
 "And he," Jesus said, "It is not right

305
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,160
 to take the children's bread

306
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,080
 and throw it to the dogs."

307
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,920
 What?

308
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,480
 What have you just said?

309
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,920
 Just when you think things couldn't get any worse,

310
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,120
 Jesus appears to call her a dog.

311
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,120
 Now, in his reply, Jesus did not call her a dog

312
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,360
 in the way the Pharisees would have addressed a Gentile.

313
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,160
 The Greek word here means a little pet dog

314
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,560
 and not the filthy disease carrying mongrels

315
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,840
 that ran the streets and ate the garbage.

316
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,000
 The children, of course, referred to the people of Israel.

317
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,480
 But Jesus was not playing games with the woman,

318
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,880
 nor was he trying to make the situation more difficult.

319
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,520
 He was drawing out of her a growing response of faith

320
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,720
 and she did not disappoint.

321
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,920
 She said, "Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs

322
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,600
 that fall under the master's table."

323
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,120
 She refuses to let go.

324
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,760
 She immediately seized on the illustration

325
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,080
 about the children's bread,

326
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,240
 which was exactly what he wanted her to do.

327
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,400
 We may paraphrase her reply.

328
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,400
 It is true that we Gentiles do not sit at the table

329
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,120
 as children and eat the bread,

330
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,240
 but even the pet dogs under the table

331
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,480
 can eat some of the crumbs.

332
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,440
 Sandra, I know this.

333
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,480
 Every time we eat, Lexi is under the table, right?

334
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,320
 And she's just ready for that little bit of crumb.

335
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,520
 What a tremendous testimony of faith.

336
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,720
 She was in fact, she was actually in effect saying,

337
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,360
 "I will gladly accept your crumbs under the table,

338
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,600
 but only if it's your table in your house.

339
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,480
 I've got no desire to deprive your children.

340
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,480
 Just let a crumb of grace fall to help my child.

341
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:41,040
 I accept your invitation and I trust you to meet our need."

342
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:48,280
 And it was this faith that Jesus acknowledged

343
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,000
 and immediately he healed her daughter.

344
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,320
 Let's read this in verse 28.

345
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,320
 "And Jesus answered her, 'Oh woman, great is your faith.

346
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,200
 Be it done for you as you desire.'

347
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,960
 And her daughter was healed instantly."

348
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:19,520
 That's worth noting that both of the persons

349
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,360
 in the gospel of Matthew who are described

350
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,520
 as having great faith were both Gentiles.

351
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,920
 This Canaanite woman and the Roman centurion

352
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,000
 that James told us about a few weeks ago.

353
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,600
 Now in both cases here,

354
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,320
 Jesus healed the one in need from a distance.

355
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,400
 You got to see the significance of this

356
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,480
 'cause spiritually speaking,

357
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,760
 the Gentiles were a far off until Calvary

358
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,000
 when Jesus Christ died for both Jews and Gentiles

359
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,600
 and made reconciliation possible.

360
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,160
 This woman's faith was great because she persisted

361
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,600
 in asking and trusting when everything seemed against her.

362
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,280
 Certainly her race was against her.

363
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,600
 She was a Gentile.

364
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,360
 Her sex was against her.

365
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,320
 For most Jewish rabbis paid little attention to women.

366
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,520
 It seemed as if the disciples were against her.

367
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,920
 And Christ's words led her to believe

368
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
 that even he was against her.

369
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,920
 All of these obstacles only made her persist in asking.

370
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:43,480
 I have a theory here.

371
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,840
 I mean, this is bizarre, right?

372
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,440
 That this bizarre exchange was actually

373
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,480
 for the benefit of the disciples.

374
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,640
 See, the disciples had been brought up

375
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,360
 in a particular religious system.

376
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,640
 It needed them to be taken out of the comfort zone

377
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,960
 of Palestine to find a new reference point

378
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,200
 for what the heart of worship looks like.

379
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,800
 It was more than being fascinated by his teaching

380
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,760
 and impressed by his miracles.

381
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,800
 The appropriate response was humble faith and worship.

382
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:36,600
 And the Canaanite woman had demonstrated this,

383
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,720
 this heart clearly.

384
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,640
 Because the next verse, verse 29,

385
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,880
 after the end of this story, it's very telling.

386
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,280
 Jesus went on from there and walked beside

387
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,600
 the Sea of Galilee.

388
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,120
 And he went up to the mountain and sat down there.

389
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,040
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something.

390
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,600
 "I'm going to tell you something."

391
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something.

392
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,920
 "I'm going to tell you something."

393
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something.

394
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,240
 "I'm going to tell you something."

395
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something.

396
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,560
 "I'm going to tell you something."

397
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something.

398
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,880
 "I'm going to tell you something."

399
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

400
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

401
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

402
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

403
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

404
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

405
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

406
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

407
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

408
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

409
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

410
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

411
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

412
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

413
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

414
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,880
 And he said, "Look, I'm going to tell you something."

415
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:51,880
 Jesus had come for this woman and for her daughter.

416
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,880
 Why?

417
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,880
 Because he wanted to teach his disciples.

418
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:03,880
 He wanted them to encounter a heart of worship.

419
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:11,880
 He reached across geographical, ethnic, religious, and cultural boundaries

420
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:19,880
 to reach her and to teach them.

421
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:28,880
 And KFCI, he wants to both reach us and teach us.

422
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,880
 The Father reached us by sending his Son.

423
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,880
 Jesus reached us by entering into everything we face and struggle with life.

424
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:52,880
 And our response is to give him our worship and trust.

425
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,880
 To give him our lives.

426
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:05,880
 I mean, totally.

427
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,880
 As I ask the band in a moment to come back, we're going to sing a response song.

428
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,880
 Not quite yet.

429
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,880
 Going back to my first point about worship in church,

430
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,880
 this song was not written in the last couple of years, like most of our songs here at KFCI.

431
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:34,880
 But it was written in 1896, 127 years ago, even before I was born.

432
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
 Look at some of the words we're going to be singing.

433
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,880
 I'll put them on the screen.

434
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,880
 All to Jesus I surrender.

435
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,880
 All to him I freely give.

436
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,880
 I will ever love and trust him.

437
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,880
 In his presence daily live.

438
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,880
 All to Jesus I surrender.

439
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
 Humbly at his feet I bow.

440
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,880
 Worldly pleasures all forsaken.

441
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,880
 Take me Jesus.

442
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
 Take me now.

443
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,880
 I surrender all.

444
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,880
 I surrender all.

445
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,880
 All to thee my blessed saviour.

446
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,880
 I surrender all.

447
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:26,880
 As I ask the band to come out, can I invite you today to be like the Canaanite woman?

448
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,880
 I'm going to invite you to do something we've never asked you to do in this church before.

449
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:39,880
 If you're able to do this, I'm going to invite you, if you can, to kneel.

450
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:44,880
 To kneel before him and to say, "Lord have mercy."

451
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,880
 I appreciate it's difficult for some of us.

452
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,880
 I'm going to invite you to offer him your life.

453
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,880
 Completely.

454
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,880
 If you're in a position to do that, can you just kneel before him, kneel before Jesus now.

455
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,880
 Let's do this.

456
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,880
 If you're not comfortable in there, get out and make some, there's plenty of space in this church.

457
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,880
 And I'm going to pray over us.

458
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:20,880
 I don't think in the six years plus we've done this service we've ever kneeled for the final song.

459
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
 I want you to stay kneeling as we sing this final song.

460
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,880
 I surrender all.

461
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,880
 I surrender all.

462
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,880
 All to thee my precious savior.

463
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:43,880
 I surrender all.

464
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:50,880
 As we kneel here, Lord, we say, "Lord have mercy."

465
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,880
 Lord have mercy on us.

466
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,880
 I offer you my life in spirit and truth.

467
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,880
 All I am is yours.

468
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:15,880
 Lord, fill me with your Holy Spirit.

469
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,880
 I surrender all.

470
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,880
 Let's sing this together.

471
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,460
 (gentle music)

472
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:37,460
