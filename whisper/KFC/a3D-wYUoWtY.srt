1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,960
 Happy New Year everyone, Salim Failak. Good. 1st of January 2022. 1 1 2 2. It's today.

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:23,020
 But why is 1 1 2 2 such a significant date? I'll tell you. It's the first day

3
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:32,920
 of the rest of your life. And it's the first date for 365 days that does not

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:47,160
 include 2021. Many of us will not be too sad to say goodbye to 2021. 2021 was a

5
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,500
 challenging year. Let's put it that way. In our Chinese calendar, 2021 is the year

6
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:06,940
 of the Ox. I looked it up. It's supposed to bring stability and calmness. Yes. In

7
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:16,780
 Hong Kong and elsewhere, it has been anything other than stable and calm. The

8
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:23,020
 coronavirus has introduced the alpha, the beta, the gamma, the delta, and now the

9
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:36,980
 Omicron variants to us. We've had vaxes, double vaxes, booster jabs. COP26, yes, and

10
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:43,820
 its attempt to influence climate control sadly came across as a little bit of a

11
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:55,580
 damp squib. Vacations, do you remember them? Vacations have now become staycations,

12
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:03,180
 including cruises to nowhere. And James is an expert on that if you want to ask

13
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,380
 anything about cruises to nowhere. Political tension has risen around the

14
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:19,300
 world with most societies, including our own, becoming increasingly polarized. But

15
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:27,460
 what sort of year has 2021 been for us as a church? Let's take a brief look in

16
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:33,780
 words and pictures. I'm going to get a slide so you can see this. In January, a

17
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:42,540
 year ago today, two weddings. Hanani and Sincere, Michelle and Philemon. January

18
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:50,540
 the 1st, we had two weddings. But worship was on Zoom. Remember that? Our first

19
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:57,660
 sermon series, Our Living Hope, was from one Peter. And in January, we had our

20
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:05,660
 first G5 Pre-Chat, Gabe, and wasn't he fantastic? Amazing. February, special

21
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:12,180
 Chinese New Year service, panel style, Julian and Florence, Christina and James,

22
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,860
 and worship continued on Zoom. By then, we were getting used to Zoom because

23
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,420
 people were showing their kids, their dogs, and everything on Zoom. It was

24
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:30,900
 amazing. March, the Wiley campaign, the start of our Easter series, Mark My Word,

25
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:41,540
 the Gospel of Mark, but worship continued on Zoom. April, worship was back live.

26
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:51,460
 Let's have a cheer. Come on. But we maintained YouTube. And interestingly,

27
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,500
 for every one of you that is here tonight, there are three people watching

28
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,860
 on YouTube. So turn again and wave to the people on YouTube. Yeah,

29
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,740
 we've kept YouTube going. Baptism. Baptism during Easter weekend.

30
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,940
 We had to find a private beach. You remember that? And it was Mark and Anthony

31
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,860
 and Ken. And we had the start of the sermon series, Beware but Grow,

32
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:24,380
 to Peter. May was actually a busy month because by now we're live, right?

33
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,780
 Start of a series, Women in the Old Testament. I loved that series.

34
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,900
 We welcomed six new members to KFC Church. We had baby dedications,

35
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,660
 not one but two but three baby dedications, Autumn and Harper and Ilana.

36
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:48,140
 We had a Mother's Day service. We had our second G5 preacher, and it was Julian,

37
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:54,140
 but I got his name wrong. He was amazing. And congratulations to Rebecca

38
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,500
 and Lawrence, another couple. The family is growing. It's good. I love it.

39
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,020
 Got married in May. June, we had our local mission trip,

40
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,740
 which would be the first of many local mission trips. You know, Johnny loves

41
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,620
 to go on overseas mission trips. It didn't work out this year,

42
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,940
 but we had lots of local mission trips. We started...Michelle started Bridge 2.

43
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,940
 But also sadly, we had to send Kelly off. We prayed Kelly to go.

44
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:29,620
 In July, we started Don't Give the Enemy a Seat at Your Table.

45
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,580
 And we had our first gathering of sisterhood. Yeah, a few cheers.

46
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,780
 That's good. In August, we had our third G5 preacher, which was Paul.

47
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,540
 Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Baptism, another three candidates we had

48
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,780
 down at Repulse Bay Beach. But we were sending off again. Julian,

49
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,780
 back to UK, but he's come back to us. It's lovely. But Joanne,

50
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,540
 back to the Philippines. And September would see my last sermon before Sandra

51
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,700
 and I's extended break. We started the KFCi Kids Club.

52
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,540
 We haven't got a lot of kids at the moment, but we started our children's ministry.

53
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,340
 We started Alpha. We didn't have a lot of people on Alpha, but we did Alpha,

54
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,820
 and people came to Christ. We started a sermon series,

55
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:24,380
 Charge 1 and 2 Timothy. In October, very important, the Restore Summit,

56
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:29,460
 a dialogue on mental health and faith. People joining us from other churches,

57
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,700
 from Young Life, from YWAM. It was amazing. And then we had that wonderful

58
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,780
 mission service weekend where James and Jo were preaching together.

59
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,340
 It was lovely. November, I can only give November to Mo.

60
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,580
 I mean, Mo just took the show from me. I mean, like, our last G5 preacher,

61
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,820
 so many creative elements, including a hand-drawn sermon illustration

62
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,820
 and a self-written rap during the sermon. That was amazing.

63
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,540
 So December, Sandra and I returned. We started a Christmas Advent series,

64
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,340
 the Nativity scene. I gave my first sermon in three months.

65
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,660
 We had a Christmas Day service, including special performances

66
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:19,780
 by different clans. And only yesterday, we had a trilingual New Year's Eve series.

67
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:31,620
 Quite a year. But why am I excited by 2022? On this day, 1-1-2-2.

68
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:37,420
 Look at these verses. You've seen them before. Isaiah 43.

69
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:43,420
 "Forget the former things. Do not dwell on the past.

70
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,620
 See, I am doing a new thing. Now it springs up. Do you not perceive it?

71
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,940
 I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland.

72
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:03,180
 See, I am doing a new thing." My tradition in almost 20 years as a pastor

73
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,300
 has been at the New Year to preach a sermon which, as it were,

74
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:15,940
 looks back but looks forward. And in that 20 years, I have never been

75
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:24,700
 more convinced that the church has perhaps its biggest opportunity in history.

76
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:31,380
 You may remember Cameo, 52 weeks old, and it still applies.

77
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:40,220
 KFC, KFCI remains a multilingual, multicultural, multigenerational church

78
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,780
 in unity, community, with a heart for mission and evangelism,

79
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:56,220
 expressed in those five letters. So I sat down to pray about 2022.

80
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,020
 And what God showed me was very simple. God just showed me hands.

81
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:13,580
 Just look at your hands for a moment. God just showed me hands.

82
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,180
 And I believe He said to me, "This is the way that I want this

83
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:27,220
 congregation to move forward in 2022, and it's represented by hands."

84
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,620
 The hand is probably the most frequently symbolized part of the human body.

85
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,260
 It gives blessing. We just sang it, didn't we?

86
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:42,140
 It is expressive. According to Aristotle, the hand is the tool of tools.

87
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,580
 In general, it is strength, power, and protection.

88
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:55,300
 However, it can quite equally mean generosity, hospitality, and stability.

89
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,860
 And this is what I see. Firstly, hands linked together in unity.

90
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,260
 Can we see that one?

91
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,340
 Boom.

92
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,100
 So actually, just link hands with a person next to you.

93
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,300
 Hands linked together. Check if they're triple vax first.

94
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:31,940
 Hands linked together in unity. Hands linked together building unity.

95
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,260
 Secondly, I saw hands raised in an incessant worship.

96
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,300
 Let's all do this together. Raised in incessant worship.

97
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,300
 Hands reaching out, evangelistically driven.

98
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:59,980
 Let's reach out. Hands available, being outward focused.

99
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,820
 Hands that were anointed, healing our city.

100
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:18,980
 And lastly, let's just do this. Hands representing emotional health.

101
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,500
 And as we do this, we come to the theme, which is the theme for Gong Fo Church this year.

102
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,260
 The Holy Spirit has been speaking to us as a church.

103
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,220
 And our theme as a church for 2022 is this.

104
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,700
 Health for all, all for God.

105
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,540
 You're going to hear those words quite a bit over the next few months.

106
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:51,780
 So 2022, we see as a vision, health for all, all for God.

107
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:57,260
 And so I want to be a bit more specific about it and see what I see within that.

108
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:06,820
 So firstly, the unity. Hands together, linked together, building a unity.

109
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,620
 And my vision for this congregation is this, that every person who comes to this congregation

110
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,300
 would be in a small group community.

111
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,700
 Now, it might be clans, it might be sisterhood, it might be something.

112
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,020
 But that we would not have anybody who is not linked into a small group.

113
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,780
 Small group is where growth take it.

114
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:34,340
 If you're not in a small group, you need to get in one.

115
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,820
 Our clans will always be that thing which would be driving it.

116
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,780
 Sisterhood.

117
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:47,860
 And the good news is that we'll be launching something very soon for the men.

118
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,860
 It will not be called brotherhood.

119
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,060
 But I had a wonderful conversation with Josh Luke this week.

120
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,700
 And Josh is going to be working with me alongside me on this.

121
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:05,100
 And we believe as we look in the church around the world, the thing that's really missing,

122
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,660
 real men.

123
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,660
 Real men.

124
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:15,820
 So we're going to have a group here which focuses on what it means to be a real man.

125
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,820
 And family.

126
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,620
 I mean, we don't get many young people on a Saturday afternoon at 5.30.

127
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,260
 It's not a good time for families.

128
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,060
 But I've been speaking to Christina and to James.

129
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,800
 And we've got this vision.

130
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,820
 It's still an early stage now where we would love eventually to have a family service.

131
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,860
 We don't know where.

132
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
 We don't know when.

133
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:46,660
 But what we'll be doing this year is maybe starting a super clan for families as a pop-up

134
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,060
 shop, as a way of moving towards a family service.

135
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,260
 All ages, remember, is part of who we are.

136
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,940
 So unity.

137
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,140
 So important to us.

138
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,420
 That's why I put it first.

139
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,060
 Secondly, worship.

140
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,700
 Hands raised in incessant worship.

141
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,940
 I have a vision for worship.

142
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,740
 Not for a congregation that sees worship as a few songs at the beginning of the service.

143
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,500
 You know, as a sort of warm-up act for the preacher.

144
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:25,220
 But a congregation who believes in using all we are and all we have to praise God for all

145
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,620
 he is and all he does.

146
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,260
 I want to honour the worship team and particularly Paul.

147
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,540
 Paul has done an amazing job.

148
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,260
 In fact, actually, can we have a round of applause?

149
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,140
 This guy does amazing.

150
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,860
 He was doing trilingual worship last night and monolingual worship.

151
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,140
 But Paul and the whole worship team, I want to honour them week after week, what they

152
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,900
 bring to us.

153
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:57,740
 And Paul's idea was to start this thing called Restore, you know, where we could have a night

154
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,540
 where we could just all worship together.

155
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,300
 The good news, at the end of this month on the 28th, there'll be an opportunity for us

156
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,540
 to come together and just worship.

157
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,020
 But I just want to encourage us that worship is something that we are and not something

158
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:18,260
 we just do at the beginning of the service.

159
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:25,780
 Evangelism, hands reaching out, evangelistically driven.

160
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:31,620
 So yes, we were doing alpha, but alpha won't be the only thing that we'll be doing.

161
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:38,580
 Mission, we've now into a situation here where because we cannot do overseas missions, and

162
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:42,020
 the problem with overseas missions is a few people go overseas, right?

163
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,740
 And the rest of us stay here.

164
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,380
 Oh, we'll pray for you.

165
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,940
 Yeah, we do that, right?

166
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,420
 But actually, what we find with city missions is we can all do it.

167
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:59,100
 And my vision, again, would be that everybody would find a way to be able to be involved

168
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,460
 in mission in this city.

169
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:08,100
 We're going to be having a focus on the workplace, workplace and faith.

170
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,260
 I'm very pleased that Anthony Singh over there is going to be joining us as an intern, working

171
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:21,660
 this year and working specifically on the interaction between workplace and faith.

172
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:27,300
 Workplace and faith in this church, workplace and faith in the Church of Hong Kong, and

173
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,580
 the workplace and faith around the world.

174
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,420
 It's going to be a focus for us.

175
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,080
 Healing hands, anointed, healing our city.

176
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,900
 We live in a divided city.

177
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,780
 We're divided generationally, politically.

178
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,020
 There's even divisions in the church.

179
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:58,740
 My heart for this year, my commitment this year is to build bridges and not build walls.

180
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,620
 That's what gets me up in the morning.

181
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:11,680
 And on the subject of healing hands, we're going to be looking at ways to promote health.

182
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,120
 We'll be looking at programs like the Cleansing Stream program later in the year, which leads

183
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,820
 me to the subject of emotional health.

184
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:31,560
 This I believe is the number one issue in the church today around the world.

185
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:39,160
 One thing which COVID has actually exaggerated even is the mental health situation, the emotional

186
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
 health.

187
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:48,120
 And that is why Kong Fuk Church this year has decided that our slogan, our theme, our

188
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,120
 vision is health for all and all for God.

189
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,440
 You know, people who are emotionally healthy are in control of their thoughts, feelings,

190
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
 and behaviors.

191
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,300
 They're able to cope with life's challenges and boy, we're going to have some challenges

192
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,480
 this year, I know.

193
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,000
 They can keep problems in perspective and bounce back from setbacks.

194
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:20,800
 They feel good about themselves and have good relationships.

195
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:27,280
 Sandra and I took three months off, including quarantine, three months off earlier this

196
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,880
 year and it was extended leave.

197
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,720
 It came for me after a bout of clinical depression.

198
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,560
 I'd shared this with you before.

199
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,000
 But in the last two years, I've been going through some clinical depression.

200
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,400
 And I decided to read a book while I was away called "The Emotionally Healthy Leader."

201
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,480
 Some of you may have seen it, some of you may have read it.

202
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,520
 Pete Sokera was a guy we've met.

203
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:05,200
 But you know, as I read this book, do you know what I realized?

204
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,440
 I'm not an emotionally healthy leader.

205
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,600
 Our church is not an emotionally healthy church.

206
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,440
 Hong Kong is not an emotionally healthy place.

207
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,040
 And what I started to do is I started to say, "God, look, actually, I'm more emotionally

208
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,520
 healthy than that person over there."

209
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,360
 You know, ABC.

210
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,640
 Or we're more emotionally healthy as a church than that church down the road.

211
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,120
 That's missing the point.

212
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,300
 We are not to compare ourselves.

213
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:53,420
 And to start our year, to set the scene for what is ahead of us, I want to look just briefly

214
00:19:53,420 --> 00:20:00,520
 at four characteristics of an emotionally unhealthy leader.

215
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,440
 And you might say, "I'm not a leader."

216
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,000
 Well, we all are.

217
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,840
 Because maybe that's another one of my visions, that we would all be leaders.

218
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:18,400
 I discovered that the deficit of emotionally unhealthy leaders impact virtually every area

219
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,320
 of their lives and leadership.

220
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,720
 However, that damage is evident, especially in four characteristics.

221
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,920
 And I want to briefly look at them.

222
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:38,500
 Number one, emotionally unhealthy leaders have very low self-awareness.

223
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:44,400
 They tend to be unaware of what's going on inside of them.

224
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:52,360
 And even when they recognize a strong emotion such as anger, they fail to process it or

225
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,960
 express it honestly and appropriately.

226
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,320
 They ignore emotion-related messages their body may be sending them.

227
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:15,960
 Stress-induced illness, weight gain, ulcers, headaches, or depression.

228
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,440
 They avoid reflecting on their fears, their sadness, or their anger.

229
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,000
 They fail to consider how God might be trying to communicate with them through these difficult

230
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,720
 emotions.

231
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,400
 They struggle to articulate the reasons for their emotional triggers, their overreactions

232
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:39,400
 in the present rooted in difficult experiences from the past.

233
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:51,200
 Number two, they prioritize ministry over marriage or singleness.

234
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,120
 This is so important here in Hong Kong.

235
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:06,880
 As your pastor, my prayer is that you fully embrace your marriedness.

236
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:14,240
 And also for those of you who are single, you embrace your singleness.

237
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,360
 I'll be honest with you, the prayer I've prayed the most since I've been in Hong Kong, young

238
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:25,600
 ladies come up to me, "Pastor, can you pray for a husband for me?"

239
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,720
 I say, "What time do you finish work?"

240
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
 They say, "9.30."

241
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,480
 I say, "You don't need me to pray."

242
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:42,440
 Those of you who are single, I'm saying, have got to learn to embrace your singleness.

243
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:49,080
 And those of us who are married have got to learn to embrace that.

244
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,760
 You won't hear this in many churches.

245
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,760
 I've got to say this.

246
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,520
 Now whether married or single, most emotionally unhealthy leaders affirm the importance of

247
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,080
 a healthy intimacy in relationships and lifestyle.

248
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:15,680
 But few, if any, have vision for their marriage or singleness as the greatest gift they offer.

249
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:23,440
 Instead, they view their marriage or their singleness as an essential or stable foundation

250
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,120
 for something more important, like building an effective ministry, which becomes their

251
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
 first priority.

252
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,160
 You know, you've seen it.

253
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:41,500
 Emotionally unhealthy leaders tend to compartmentalize their married or single life, separating it

254
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,080
 both from their leadership and their relationship with Jesus.

255
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:53,400
 For example, they make significant leadership decisions without thinking through the long-term

256
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:00,160
 impact those decisions could have on the quality and integrity of their single or married life.

257
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:06,560
 They dedicate their best energy, their thought and creative efforts to leading others, and

258
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,000
 they fail to invest in a rich and full married or single life.

259
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 I want to give you a question.

260
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 Can any of you spot Michelle in the congregation?

261
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 Where's Michelle?

262
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 She's not here.

263
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,400
 I tell you why she's not here.

264
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
 Today is her wedding anniversary.

265
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:36,280
 And I've told her, on her wedding anniversary, she needs to be with her husband.

266
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,720
 And that's the sort of thing I'm talking about, the sort of priority that we have today.

267
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,840
 "Oh, yes, I could take two hours off to come to church."

268
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,400
 No.

269
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,800
 I'm very serious about this.

270
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:01,280
 I'm just so sick of that friends in the church getting divorced and breakups and breakup

271
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,520
 relationships.

272
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,640
 This leads on to number three.

273
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,640
 We all do this.

274
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:15,960
 They do more activity for God than their relationship with God can sustain.

275
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,120
 This is so prevalent in Hong Kong.

276
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,000
 If I go up to someone in Hong Kong and say, "How are you?"

277
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 What do they answer?

278
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 "I'm busy."

279
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,160
 You laugh, but you should be crying.

280
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
 Shoot.

281
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,160
 Activity, activity, activity.

282
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:47,120
 Emotionally extended leaders, emotionally unhealthy leaders are chronically overextended.

283
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,160
 Although they routinely have too much to do in too little time, they persist in a knee-jerk

284
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,720
 yes to new opportunities.

285
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
 "Can you do this?"

286
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
 "Yes."

287
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,880
 Before prayerfully and discerning God's will.

288
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,400
 Now the reason I know this, I know this from personal experience.

289
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,640
 I am one of the biggest culprits.

290
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,000
 I'm preaching to myself here.

291
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:24,240
 The notion of slowed down spirituality or slowed down leadership in which they're doing

292
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:34,000
 for Jesus flows out of their being with Jesus is a foreign concept.

293
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,840
 If they think of it at all, spending time in solitude and silence is viewed as a luxury

294
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,960
 or something best suited for a different kind of leader and not part of their core spiritual

295
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,400
 practices or essential for effective leadership.

296
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:59,640
 Their first priority is leading their organization, team, or ministry as a means of impacting the

297
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,380
 world for Christ.

298
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,560
 If you were to ask them to write down a list of their top three priorities for how they

299
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:14,560
 spend their time as a leader, it's unlikely that cultivating a deep transformative relationship

300
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,280
 with Jesus would make that list.

301
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:27,480
 As a result, fragmentation and depletion constitute the normal condition for their lives and leadership.

302
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:35,040
 And number four, these are all related together, they lack a work Sabbath rhythm.

303
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,640
 Many unhealthy leaders do not practice Sabbath.

304
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,800
 We will be spending one week, I've got to tell you this, we will be spending one week

305
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,640
 concentrating just on Sabbath.

306
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,000
 A weekly 24-hour period in which they cease all work and rest, delight in God's gifts

307
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,120
 and enjoy life with him.

308
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:19,320
 And they feed their soul.

309
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,520
 A day off is not a Sabbath.

310
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,880
 If they practice Sabbath at all, they do it inconsistently, believing that they need to

311
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,200
 finish all their work or work hard enough to earn their right to rest.

312
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,240
 Now why am I saying all this?

313
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,760
 I'm sorry this is not tickle your ear type stuff, but this is what's really in my heart

314
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:48,760
 at the moment.

315
00:28:48,760 --> 00:29:08,360
 I'm saying this because emotional health and spiritual health are inseparable.

316
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:14,200
 I've learned this truth the hard way through personal experience.

317
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,120
 And that's why I've spent so much of my vision 2022 talk on it.

318
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:30,920
 My prime vision for 2022, above all those other things I described, is an emotionally

319
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,880
 healthy church.

320
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,840
 As a worldwide, as a citywide church, as KFC church, we are only just beginning to realize

321
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:49,120
 that discipleship must include addressing the emotional brokenness that is part of every

322
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:58,080
 member of the congregation, including probably more especially us as pastors.

323
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,880
 Closer examination of our experience of imbalanced spirituality combined with the spiritual busyness

324
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:13,440
 of ministry leads us to discover that we've not allowed Jesus to penetrate to the core

325
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,320
 of our person and meet our deepest needs.

326
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,440
 So what's the answer?

327
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:32,340
 The good news is that we're going to be doing a journey together, all of us.

328
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:40,660
 And our intended destination is emotional health.

329
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:45,760
 As I said at the beginning, I believe it is the most important issue facing the worldwide

330
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,760
 church.

331
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,460
 Sandra and I speak to leaders all around the world on a regular basis, and this is coming

332
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,840
 up time and time again.

333
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,960
 This is the most important issue at the moment.

334
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,880
 And I'm going to spend the next few minutes, as it were, giving you a trailer for what

335
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,560
 you can expect.

336
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:15,300
 I want to start by asking the question, why do we need this?

337
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:21,940
 I believe that many of our church, our current church discipleship models do not address

338
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:29,180
 the issues of emotional and relational maturity that make up the core of human experience.

339
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:35,420
 Therefore, many Christians look just like those outside the church.

340
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:43,140
 And we have the same type of broken, failed relationships as unbelievers.

341
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:51,600
 Christians may be considered spiritually mature while not truly reaching emotional adulthood.

342
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,860
 The current discipleship models do not address this unbalanced spirituality.

343
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:03,580
 The training provided in essential areas of discipleship, such as prayer and Bible study,

344
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:14,400
 essential as they are, need to be supplemented by a new model that's based on Jesus's life.

345
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:22,320
 Our journey together is going to be rooted in Scripture, and it's going to be rooted

346
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:31,080
 in the life of Jesus, and will help us see what spiritual maturity looks like as it relates

347
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,460
 to emotional health, especially in loving other people.

348
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:45,840
 The church is God's instrument for showing His love, His hands to the world.

349
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:55,300
 It is also one of God's tools in developing spiritual and emotional maturity in His people.

350
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:01,740
 Integrating emotional maturity with a focus on loving well into discipleship is a key

351
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:11,640
 to meeting the purpose God has for the church, to be a reflection of His love for the world.

352
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,700
 So as go the leaders, go the church.

353
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:23,500
 God wants to penetrate and heal the lives of His people, not just the leaders.

354
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:32,380
 I want to share with you the biblical basis for a new paradigm of discipleship, and it's

355
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,700
 Jesus.

356
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:41,180
 Jesus is the model for how His followers should live and minister.

357
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:48,420
 This is universally understood as the basis for all discipleship models.

358
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:56,040
 Those models don't realize that Jesus, read the Gospels again, Jesus doesn't push His

359
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,300
 emotional life to the side.

360
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:08,500
 We will learn together over the next few weeks, Jesus was a human being who dealt with the

361
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:15,860
 spiritual, emotional, physical, and social aspects of His life.

362
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:20,020
 Jesus was a whole person.

363
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:29,020
 He freely expressed His emotions in the same way His followers must address every aspect

364
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:35,140
 of their humanity, not just the spiritual.

365
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:43,260
 One cannot be spiritually mature while remaining emotionally immature.

366
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:54,260
 I'll say it again, one cannot be spiritually mature while remaining emotionally immature.

367
00:34:54,260 --> 00:35:00,100
 Don't worry, we're going to tackle this together.

368
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,180
 Together we will discover six important principles.

369
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,600
 I'll put them on the chart.

370
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,980
 I won't go through them today.

371
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,900
 We'll be discovering this.

372
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,580
 And I've come up with a key verse for our time together.

373
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,460
 Maybe we can read it together, Philippians 4.

374
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,460
 Ready?

375
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,660
 One, two, three.

376
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:27,780
 Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving,

377
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,680
 let your requests be known to God.

378
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:37,300
 And the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ

379
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,300
 Jesus.

380
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,300
 Philippians 4, 6-7.

381
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300
 Thank you.

382
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:48,820
 This is what the next four months will look like.

383
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,940
 It's a sandwich.

384
00:35:51,940 --> 00:36:02,460
 The bread is emotional health and the filling is unity.

385
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:09,740
 Starting next week, we will have seven sermons in our Emotionally Healthy series, "Health

386
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:19,980
 for All, All for God," addressing the key issues I mentioned with a biblical basis,

387
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:25,140
 with clan material to complement it.

388
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:31,860
 On February the 26th, we will start the "I Am" series, the one campaign.

389
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:41,060
 An eight-week sermon series on the seven "I Am" segments of John's gospel that Jesus said,

390
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:46,180
 together with a special small group study.

391
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,040
 And then two specials at the end.

392
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,100
 On April the 23rd, which is my birthday, in case you want to note that down.

393
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
 Good.

394
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:59,980
 Emotional health in the light of incarnation, in the light of Jesus being born.

395
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:08,900
 And then on April the 30th, emotional health in the power of the resurrection.

396
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:15,040
 I for one, are excited.

397
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,580
 I trust you are.

398
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:23,540
 And for those people watching online, I trust you are too.

399
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:31,700
 So your question, as I ask the worship band to come back, is how do I respond?

400
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,260
 And really, I'm going to ask you to respond.

401
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,860
 We're going to be taking communion in a moment.

402
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,860
 But before that, I want you to ask to respond by just...

403
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:47,260
 I want to bring back hands again.

404
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,640
 By just offering your hands to God, I'm going to pray for you.

405
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,940
 So let's just do that.

406
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,800
 This is the 1st of January, 2022.

407
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
 We can make a choice.

408
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,660
 We can live this year our way.

409
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:08,500
 We can come up with a list of things we want to do.

410
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,180
 Tick them off, bucket lists.

411
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:16,740
 Or we can say, "God, here I am.

412
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,740
 I'm available."

413
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:32,680
 Father, I ask you to come by your Holy Spirit, to take these hands, that these hands would

414
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:42,360
 reach out to those around me, that I would be an agent of unity.

415
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:49,740
 Take these hands of my whole body and, Lord, make me a worshiper.

416
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:55,160
 The worship would be not something I do on a Saturday afternoon, but with my whole life.

417
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:05,580
 Lord, take these hands, make them outward-focused to the people in our city that we need to

418
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,060
 reach out to.

419
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,680
 Lord, make them evangelistic.

420
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,460
 Show me, Lord, the people you want to reach for you.

421
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,300
 Lord, anoint my hands for healing.

422
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:31,860
 Lord, that I would be an agent of your love with everyone I see.

423
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:44,660
 Lord, that I would just be able to put my arms around the ones who are sad and discomfort.

424
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,140
 I would lay hands upon the sick.

425
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:55,700
 I would reach out to the poor.

426
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:02,500
 Reach out to the widows and the orphans.

427
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:08,820
 Reach out to those who feel disaffected in our city.

428
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:14,300
 Lord, I want to give you my emotions.

429
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:20,820
 I feel it's so important at the beginning of this year we give God our emotions.

430
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:30,340
 And I declare, Lord, I am not in the place that I need to be.

431
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:35,580
 This church is not in the place we need to be.

432
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:53,700
 Lord, help us as we journey together and discuss and learn and experience what it is to be

433
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,700
 an emotionally healthy church.

434
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:05,460
 And Lord, I recognize I cannot do any of this on my own.

435
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:11,180
 I need you.

436
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:16,420
 Holy Spirit, fill me afresh.

437
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:21,820
 Lord, we cannot live off last year's anointing.

438
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,220
 2021 is gone.

439
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:31,620
 This is a new year.

440
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,380
 Take my hands and use them for your glory.

441
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:42,220
 In Jesus' name, amen.
