[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.560]   As Ecclesiastes can appear a rather depressing book at first glance, I wanted to share with
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.600]   you Sandra and I's happy place in Hong Kong.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.800]   It is, of course, Hong Kong Disneyland.
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.240]   Now everyone says, "Is it because you take the grandkids?"
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.240]   But the truth is no.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.000]   Inevitably it's just the two of us.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.720]   Now being big kids, I've put another picture up there, being big kids in what Disney describe
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:57.680]   as a magical place where there are no emails, WhatsApps, or people asking for help and advice.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.760]   And my favorite is the Lion King.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.280]   I'll tell you why.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.160]   30 minutes of air conditioning.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:19.120]   If you've ever trudged around Disney, especially in the humid Hong Kong summer, you'll know
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.480]   what I mean.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:35.240]   The Lion King story revolves around the Elton John and Tim Rice song, "The Circle of Life."
[00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.080]   Circles have no beginning and no end.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.760]   If we start anywhere in a circle and we follow it around, we end up in a loop coming back
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.800]   to where we started.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   It makes me wonder if Simba and Co. got their inspiration from Ecclesiastes.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.160]   They certainly would if they'd listened to Pastor Michelle's excellent sermon last week.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:14.800]   Michelle spoke about an English word that few of us ever use in our everyday language,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.280]   futility.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.240]   And what I loved was her use of the Hebrew word, havel.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.200]   Do you remember she asked us to grasp the air?
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.840]   You remember we all did this?
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:40.560]   Michelle told us that the word havel appears 30 times in Ecclesiastes.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.600]   Essentially havel means things are insubstantial or fleeting and have no purpose.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.520]   Futile.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.080]   Lacking substance.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.000]   Michelle told us that all is vanity.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.720]   Everything is havel.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.720]   Profitless.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   Purposeless.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   It cannot be grasped.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   And it was fleeting.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.720]   Nothing really has a point and you can't hold onto it.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   I remember when I was as a younger man in the corporate world.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   We had these things called KPIs, key performance indicators.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.720]   Some of you will recognise those.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.720]   The business was run on KPIs.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   KPIs provided targets for teams to shoot for, milestones to gauge progress,
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:57.720]   and insights to help people across the organisation make better decisions.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   When we are tied to a corporation or an organisation, our lives seem to revolve around KPIs.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   And I remember we were paid bonuses.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:20.720]   Yes, I remember bonuses through a system called MBO, management by objective.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.720]   Achieve your MBO.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.720]   That was your holiday.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.720]   That was your new TV.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   Or should I say on the screen, a new pair of Stephen Curry 413 basketball shoes.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:47.720]   But can I say, 20 years on, what difference has achieving or not my MBOs made?
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.720]   Is the world a better place?
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.720]   Can I actually even remember what my MBOs or my KPIs were?
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:04.720]   And this is what the writer of Ecclesiastes, now whether that was Solomon or not, we discussed that last week,
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.720]   it's what the writer of Ecclesiastes was driving at.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.720]   And what we're going to look at tonight in the rest of chapter one,
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.720]   is the writer tells us four things.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.720]   He said, nothing seems to change.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.720]   Nothing seems to satisfy.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.720]   Nothing is new under the sun.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   And nothing is understood.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   We're back on futility.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.720]   Havel, what's the point?
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   Or is it pointless?
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.720]   Let's look at these one at a time.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   Firstly, nothing seems to change.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.720]   And the first piece of evidence is the earth.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:08.720]   From a human point of view, nothing seems more durable than the planet on which we live.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   Generations come and go whilst the earth abides forever.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   That's a common expression, don't we? As sure as the world.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   I must say, just going off the subject for a moment, I'm heartened by the work of today's generation,
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   especially the younger pioneers to save our planet.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:44.720]   But the writer is stressing that whilst nature is fundamentally permanent, notwithstanding what we're doing to it,
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.720]   man is transient.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   In verse four, we see expressed very clearly the brevity of life.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.720]   And the certainty of death.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.720]   A generation goes, a generation comes.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.720]   But the earth remains forever.
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   The 19th century Scottish essayist Thomas Carlyle said this.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:32.720]   History is a mighty drama enacted upon the theatre of time with suns for lamps and eternity for a background.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:45.720]   You see, the costumes and the sets may change, but the actors and the script remain pretty much the same.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.720]   The second piece of evidence is the sun.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.720]   As we move now from the cycle of birth and death.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.720]   To the cycle of day and night in the heavens.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   I need to tell you that the sun is constant with its rising and its setting.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:16.720]   The expression as sure as the world is replaced by another one as certain as night follows day.
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.720]   Verse five says this.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.720]   The sun rises.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:28.720]   The sun goes down and hastens to the place where it rises.
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:35.720]   I know it's been very hot this week here and especially in Europe.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   I have to say, those pictures I saw of houses burning and things.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:50.720]   And you can tell when the world's turned upside down when there's floods in Sydney and there's bushfires in London, right?
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:57.720]   But as far as the heavens are concerned, one day it's just like another.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.720]   And the heavens remain the same.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.720]   Our third piece of evidence is the wind.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.720]   Look at this, verse six.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   The wind blows to the south and goes around to the north.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   Around and around goes the wind and on circuits the wind returns.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.720]   This is not a physics lesson.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.720]   This is an observation.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   The winds continue their whirling cycle.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   Yes, we get typhoons here in Hong Kong and we've seen hurricanes, cyclones and more often than not, the gentle breeze in the trees.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:45.720]   But after all changing direction, it is still the wind.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.720]   Man comes and goes.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:57.720]   Michel used the word vapour. But the changeless wind goes on forever.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   The fourth and last piece of evidence is the sea.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:14.720]   The writer describes the water cycle also as rivers run into the sea, then through evaporation and rain returns to the rivers again.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:27.720]   Scientists tell me that at any time, 97% of all the water in the earth is in the oceans.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:35.720]   And that only 0.0001% is in the atmosphere, available for rain.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.720]   I think we got most of it two weeks ago, didn't we?
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:46.720]   Read this. All streams run to the sea, but the sea is not full.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   To the place where the streams flow, there they flow again.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   The river and rain run into the sea, but the sea never changes.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:18.720]   And so, whether we look to the earth or the heavens, the wind, the waves, we arrive at the conclusion that nature doesn't change.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   No wonder the author seems to agree with the author of The Lion King.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   That life is just one big circle. And that frankly, life is not worth living.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   And they would be right.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   If you leave God out of the picture.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:54.720]   The world would be predictable, unchangeable, with no answers to prayers, no miracles.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   God imprisoned by the laws of nature.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:06.720]   But you and I know differently.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   The God we know splits the sea so we can walk right through it.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   And we can sing it, echoing the exodus and the parting of the Red Sea.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:27.720]   We pray for the rain, the wind, the fire of the spirit to fall upon us.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   We no longer live in a closed system of endless monotonous cycles.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:43.720]   We live in this world as pilgrims and not as prisoners.
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   But this writer, oh my goodness, he's not going to let up.
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   His next argument is this, oh, nothing seems to satisfy.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.720]   He says all things are full of weariness.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.720]   A man cannot utter it.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:09.720]   The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.720]   When I was young, I remember the Rolling Stones, it's probably only me and you, Joseph.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   The Rolling Stones singing, I can't get no satisfaction. Do you remember that?
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   I can't get no satisfaction.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.720]   Human nature is always clamouring for more.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   Despite all our labours, man is never truly satisfied.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   And the entertainment industry, they see this hunger and they take advantage.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   And they make billions as a result.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.720]   I want to tell you something.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:14:00.720]   The eye cannot be satisfied until it sees the hand of God.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:08.720]   The ear cannot be satisfied until it hears the voice of God.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   Let us submit to him and only then will we be satisfied.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   I love this verse from Isaiah 58 verse 11.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   And the Lord will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scorched places and make your bones strong.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:43.720]   You shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:50.720]   But the writer of Ecclesiastes, he's persistent, he still doesn't give up.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   He says, there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.720]   Let's read it.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.720]   What has been is what will be.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.720]   And what has been done is what will be done.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   There is nothing new under the sun.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.720]   Is there a thing of which it said, see, this is new?
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.720]   It's already been in the ages before us.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:28.720]   There is no remembrance of former things, nor will there be remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.720]   I've put a quote on the screen.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   Robert Schindler, a Baptist pastor and a close associate of Charles Spurgeon, wrote this.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   If it's new, it's not true.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   If it's true, it's not new.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   We need to remember that man is the creature.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.720]   It is God alone who is the creator.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.720]   The problem is we have bad memories.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.720]   We don't read the minutes of the previous meeting.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:19.720]   Verse 11 simply says, we simply don't remember the past, nor will the future remember the present.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:33.720]   The Christian follows a God who says, behold, I am doing a new thing.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:38.720]   That is, writer now suddenly changes his hats.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.720]   He suddenly changes hats from historian to philosopher.
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.720]   He's putting on his preacher hat.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:54.720]   Michel told us that the Hebrew word was kohelef.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   And then talks about his own search for wisdom before coming to the conclusion that all human wisdom is futile.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.720]   And his fourth point was this.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.720]   He said, nothing's understood.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:20.720]   I want to read this in one chunk for you before picking it apart.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.720]   I, the preacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   And I applied my heart to seek and search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:35.720]   It's an unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   I've seen everything that's done under the sun.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   And behold, all is vanity and is striving under the wind.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.720]   What is crooked cannot be made straight.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.720]   What is lacking cannot be counted.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:54.720]   He said, in my heart, I've acquired great wisdom, surpassing all that were over Jerusalem before me.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.720]   And my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:09.720]   I perceive that this also is but a striving after the wind.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.720]   For in much wisdom is much vexation.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:19.720]   And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.720]   What I want to do, I want to look at this in three parts.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.720]   Number one, the first part is the preacher describes his search.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.720]   He reminds us he was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:41.720]   He determined, he said, I applied my heart to use wisdom and search all that has been done under heaven.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:47.720]   A task that he understood God had given all men to challenge them.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   I want you to look at this statement.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:56.720]   A statement about life itself in verse 13.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:02.720]   It is unhappy business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.720]   Now that's the ESV.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.720]   The message puts it like this.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.720]   Now let me tell you, there's not much to write home about.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:19.720]   God hasn't made it easy for us.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   You don't need me to tell you that life is tough.
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   Other Bible versions talk about life as a grievous task, a miserable fate, a terrible burden.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:46.720]   But what verse 13 tells us that while life is tough, it is a gift from God.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:51.720]   I was sitting at home the other night having a, I had a woe is me day.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   It seemed like everything that could go wrong, so went wrong.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:05.720]   And I was sitting at home, like feeling sorry for myself when I heard a bird singing outside.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.720]   It was if the bird was saying to me, yeah, it's been quite a day.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   I've been avoiding predators all day and having to scrap for bits of food for me and my little ones.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.720]   I've done nothing but fight to survive.
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   But at the end of the day, I've still got the breath and the will to sing.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.720]   I was immediately reminded of Phil Wickham's song, Sing.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.720]   He says this, "For the cross that you bore and the debt that you paid,
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.720]   for the victory you won over death and the grave, this is the reason I sing.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:49.720]   For the hope that you give and the joy that you bring, for the promise that heaven is waiting for me.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   This is the reason I sing."
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   Life is indeed a gift from God.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.720]   And it doesn't get any easier if you try and run away from it.
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.720]   Look at verse 14, "I have seen everything that is done under the sun,
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   and behold all is vanity and is striving after the wind."
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   The writer, the preacher is saying that all works done under the sun
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.720]   never truly satisfy the heart.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:27.720]   And we start looking for things that will fill the gap.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   Both the workaholic, we've got a few in Hong Kong, right?
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   The workaholic and the alcoholic are running away from reality.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:45.720]   But we only make life harder by trying to escape.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:56.720]   Instead of running away from God, we should run to God and let him make a life worth living.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   Referencing our emotional health series here at KFCI,
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:07.720]   I am more than deeply saddened by the prevalence of suicides and attempted suicides,
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   particularly of our younger people here in Hong Kong and elsewhere.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:21.720]   My friends, we must never stop reaching out to people around us.
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.720]   But for those of us that are making a choice to live,
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   we also need to make a choice how to live.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.720]   Back to Ecclesiastes 1, we find a proverb, a popular saying in verse 15,
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:48.720]   "What is crooked cannot be made straight, and what is lacking cannot be counted."
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.720]   I'll put it in English.
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   The past cannot always be changed,
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:23:00.720]   and it is pointless to fret on what you might have done.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.720]   I always say, those of you who know me well,
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:16.720]   those two useless words in the English language are "should have."
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.720]   What we have done wrong cannot normally be righted,
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:31.720]   except that we must remember that God has the power to straighten what is twisted and supply what is lacking.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   I know. Why?
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:46.720]   He took this twisted individual, me, and took all my past mistakes and failures.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   He nailed them to a cross, and he set me free.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   For a child of God, the past, even with our sins and mistakes, is a rudder that guides us forward.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   I'm going to say that again.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   For a child of God, the past, even with our sins and mistakes, is a rudder that guides us forward.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:22.720]   Let's look to wrap this up as we return to the preacher.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   We look at the preacher applying his God-given wisdom.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:36.720]   He acknowledged the greatness and the wisdom he'd attained.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   He had PhDs coming out of his ears, right? He had so much of it.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   He therefore sought to apply it to understand wisdom, madness, and folly.
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.720]   Let's read what he said.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   I said in my heart, I've acquired great wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.720]   And my heart has great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   And I applied my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:16.720]   I perceived that this also is but a striving after wind.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:24.720]   Quite often, wisdom, wisdom and knowledge, wisdom and experience will not solve every problem.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:29.720]   For a start, there are no explanations for some things that happen.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   I have no explanation for what's happened to Brian and Marissa this week.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   But perhaps more importantly, God wants his people to live on promises and not on explanations.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.720]   Can I say that again?
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   God wants his people to live on promises and not explanations.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:06.720]   To live by sight and not, sorry, to live by faith and not by sight.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   Sorry, Alison, you put me off there.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   I thought I'd said something to upset you and you were running out.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   To live by faith and not by sight.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:23.720]   The preacher's great wisdom only added to his difficulties.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:31.720]   For so often, wisdom and knowledge can simply add to sorrow and grief.
[00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   The more we seek wisdom and knowledge, the more it becomes obvious just how ignorant we are.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   I find the more I learn, the less I know.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:47.720]   The more I learn, I find myself more saying it depends.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   Maybe, possibly, or the infamous I don't know.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.720]   T.S. Eliot who wrote Cats once wrote this.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   All of our knowledge brings us nearer to our ignorance.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.720]   I think he got his inspiration from Ecclesiastes 1 which concludes like this.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:15.720]   The preacher concluding that human wisdom is futile.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   He says this.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   I perceive that this is also but a striving after the wind.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.720]   For in much wisdom is much vexation.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:29.720]   And he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:35.720]   The old proverb states a wise man is never happy.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:41.720]   But it doesn't have to be like that.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.720]   And this is the most important line I'm going to speak this evening.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   So listen to this.
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:55.720]   For the Christian life is an open door and not a closed circle.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.720]   Can I say that again?
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   The Christian life is an open door and not a closed circle.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   I and others can testify that they experience daily new blessings from the Lord.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   I can't explain everything.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.720]   But my life is not built on explanations.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.720]   It's built on promises.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:35.720]   I read that there are between 5,000 and 8,000 promises in the Bible.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.720]   That puts us in a privileged position.
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.720]   I mean, look at the scientist.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:50.720]   He or she wants to tell you that the world is a closed system and that nothing has changed.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:58.720]   Look at the historian who tells us life is a closed box and nothing is new.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:08.720]   Look at the philosopher who tells us that life is a deep problem and that nothing is understood.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   But Jesus Christ, whom Paul describes as the power of God and the wisdom of God,
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:25.720]   has miraculously broken into history to bring new life to all who trust him.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:38.720]   My friend, if you are living in circles, it's time to change your tune.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:47.720]   It's time to change your tune, maybe from the circle of life to perhaps a Kuna Matata.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:30:02.720]   But better still, to turn your eyes upon Jesus and to put your trust in him.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:09.720]   If you stand and go ask the band or at least Paul the band to come up and lead us in this song.
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.720]   We're going to sing this song together, "Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus."
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   We sang a few new songs tonight.
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.720]   This is one that's an old song. You'll know this.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.720]   I remember singing it at Sunday school, it shows how old it is.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.720]   Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in his wonderful face,
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   and the things of life will go strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   And at the end of it, Johnny will come up and pray for us.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:46.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
