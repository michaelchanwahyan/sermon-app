[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800]   And we're continuing our series called Charged, the books 1 and 2 Timothy.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.800]   And we're right in the middle of it.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.760]   So far, Paul has charged Timothy, who is a young pastor in Ephesus, to love.
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.520]   He's been charged to uphold truth, as we see in the next slide.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.860]   We've been charged to pray.
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:34.080]   And then last week, we've seen how James has led us in the charge to lead.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:41.520]   And today we are looking at chapter 4 of 1 Timothy, and Paul's charge to Timothy is to
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.800]   serve.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.520]   And so we're going to look at a couple of things.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.320]   To serve, we need to beware and to be watchful.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.640]   To serve, we need to be training and be diligent.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.160]   We need to be setting an example, and we also need to have devotion to the Word of God.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.920]   And so the first thing that we see that Paul tells Timothy is that he needs to beware and
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.920]   watchful.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.440]   What do we need to beware and watchful for?
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.640]   Well, there are those that will leave the faith, those who will depart, right?
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.280]   And some will, you know, be departing because of deceiving spirits.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.680]   Some will depart because of false teaching.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.080]   I'm going to show you a photo, the next slide here, and it's of my high school fellowship.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.240]   I don't know if you guys see me.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.640]   You guys see me?
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.000]   Anybody find me yet?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.200]   You see me with these curtains, as James calls them?
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200]   I'm on the top.
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.840]   Apparently, I like to climb things back then as well.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.320]   This is my old high school fellowship.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.520]   And you can guess, how many people do you think are left from that fellowship, from
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.040]   high school and stayed into our university fellowship?
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.760]   Actually, only three of us, right?
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:02.160]   And I actually did a study of why are our students leaving the Chinese churches in Toronto.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.400]   And some left because of theological issues.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.140]   They don't really agree with, you know, the theological issues of the church.
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.360]   Some had leadership issues.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.120]   Oh, they didn't think, oh, they were treated fairly in the church.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.280]   Some others had other priorities, right?
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.460]   Some, you know, think that school's more important or they got into work or something else had
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.920]   more priority.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.160]   Some didn't come to church anymore because of loneliness or lack of relationships.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.240]   People will leave the church.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.360]   And Paul is warning Timothy, some people may depart.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.360]   And some of the reasons that these people depart is because of deceiving spirits or
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.960]   false teachings.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.040]   I remember just last year, one of the students was telling me about how he joined a Bible
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.280]   study on HKU campus.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.920]   We see the next slide, a lovely partnership we had with ICF.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.960]   Bonnie is in it.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.160]   And we did some partnership and we connected with some of the students, had banners and
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.080]   handed out some goods.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.760]   One of our students connected with a student and asked him to join a Bible study.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.680]   And so he joined this Bible study thinking, yeah, it's good.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.920]   You know, we're joining a Bible study on campus.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.000]   Must be a good thing.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.960]   And slowly as he got into the Bible and he came to several sessions, he found out that
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.560]   this study was actually a part of a cult, a cult that suggested that these people needed
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.600]   to work for their salvation, that their salvation was not by faith.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.760]   And Paul is also warning Timothy of certain false teachings back then.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:56.980]   As we look in the next slide, he tells Timothy that these people are insincere liars whose
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.800]   consciences are seared, who forbid marriage and require abstinence from food that God
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.120]   created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.040]   And so firstly, Paul is talking about the ancient practice of branding.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.600]   They used to brand criminals.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.320]   They used to brand animals.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.880]   As you see in the next slide, you know, they used to brand horses, you know, by searing,
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.320]   you know, maybe their skin.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.120]   And so Paul is saying that these people have been seared in their conscience.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.680]   And what does that mean, that they've been seared in their conscience?
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.880]   And that means that their nerve endings, the nerve endings in their consciences that used
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.800]   to tell them, oh, this is wrong, or this is what God likes, has now been burnt and that
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.360]   they are dead to the feelings towards God.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.560]   Marriage is a mandate, a biblical mandate.
[00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.340]   And all things, Paul says all things are permissible, right?
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.520]   Not everything is beneficial, but all things are permissible.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.060]   Paul also had, Peter also had a vision in which unclean foods were now not unclean.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.800]   They were allowed to be eaten.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.680]   And so Paul is saying that these people are going against the biblical mandate of marriage
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.140]   and that also foods are allowed to be eaten.
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.440]   And so that was one of the false teachings that they had back then, that Paul was warning
[00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.700]   Timothy about.
[00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.600]   And Paul goes on to say that everything created by God is good.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.240]   And nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving.
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:52.240]   God created marriage, God created food to be good things that we are to enjoy and we
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.680]   are to partake in.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.240]   And so Paul continues, and he also says that not only are we supposed to be aware of these
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.680]   things that are happening, those that will depart, those that will depart because they
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.960]   are deceived or false teachings that will occur.
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.760]   He also warns us to be watchful.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.240]   This passage is like a chiastic system.
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.680]   Do you guys know what chiastic system is?
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.040]   It's like it's written in A, B, C, and then it reverses C, B, A.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.280]   And so the first thing that Paul tells Timothy is to beware.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.600]   And the last thing that Paul tells Timothy in this chapter is to be watchful.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.000]   What is he to be watchful of?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.480]   He's to be watchful of his life, of his doctrine, and to be persevering in his ministry.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:53.400]   Paul wants Timothy to be ministerially self-aware, to examine and to guard his heart and his
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.360]   soul so that he's not a person that is just acting outwardly, right?
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:05.880]   But that he, his outward actions is matched by his inward desire to serve and to love
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.080]   God.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:14.040]   And so he says in verse 16, "Keep a close watch on yourself and your teaching."
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.600]   So we need to, as servants of the Lord, as we are serving the Lord, we need to watch
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   ourselves.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.000]   Is our life in balance?
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.080]   Are we taking care of ourselves physically?
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.360]   Are we watching our emotional needs, our mental needs, and our spiritual needs?
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.840]   A lot of people get burnt out, right?
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.320]   Because of their serving too much or their giving too much, and they're not watching
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.320]   themselves.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.800]   And Paul is telling Timothy, "You need to watch your life carefully."
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.060]   And he needs to also watch his doctrine, right?
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.760]   He just warned Paul in the beginning of the, of the scripture that he needs to watch of
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.400]   false teachings.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:59.960]   And now Paul is watching, telling Timothy to watch of his own doctrine.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.600]   We can't just give, we can't just give without taking care of ourselves.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:11.120]   And we need to make sure that when we give, we are giving according to the doctrine that
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.200]   God is teaching in his word.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:21.320]   So the first thing that Paul heeds Timothy is that he needs to beware and to be watchful.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.640]   The second thing that Timothy is being warned of is to be training and to be diligent.
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.960]   What is he to be training in?
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.640]   He's to be training in godliness.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.960]   And let's look at the verses that were just read, right?
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   Godliness is valuable in every way.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:47.240]   Maybe training is, has some value, but godliness is valuable in every way.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.720]   Godliness is the path towards eternal life and happiness.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:59.680]   This is the first real command he tells Timothy here, you know, train, you need to be training
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.860]   just like an athletic person is training for the Olympics.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.120]   He needs to be training for godliness.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.720]   I don't know if you've heard of the 10,000 hour rule.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:17.680]   Has anybody heard of the 10,000 hour rule before in which you need to be training 10,000
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.680]   hours in order to master any skill?
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.520]   Obviously you need to be practicing in the right way, right?
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.240]   Not in the wrong way for 10,000 hours.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.920]   So that means eight hours a day, five days a week, 44 weeks in a year.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:40.920]   And eventually, hopefully you'll master that talent in guitar or, you know, being a doctor
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:45.720]   or architecture, or I don't know, what does JP do?
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.520]   JP does board games.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:56.400]   You need to be doing that 10,000 hours in order to be able to master anything.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:05.520]   And so we also need to be training in our godliness to be able to be servants of the
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.880]   Lord that he has called us to be.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   We need to be training.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.680]   We need to be diligent.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:19.280]   Paul tells Timothy in verse 10, for this, we end, for this end, we toil and we strive.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.740]   Ministry is not always easy.
[00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.520]   Ministry can be hard sometimes, right?
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:28.000]   There can be tough, there can be tough soil.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.560]   There can be tough times in which there are no fruit.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:38.120]   And Paul is telling Timothy that he needs to labor, right?
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.520]   And there will be ups and downs of ministry.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.320]   And we need to be aware of that.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:49.320]   Paul is telling Timothy to be diligent, to be committed, to be engaged.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:55.680]   Jesus was fully engaged and committed in his ministry when he was on earth.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.640]   Paul was also fully committed.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:05.520]   You know, he was beaten, he was stoned, he was kicked out, and yet he was still committed,
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.040]   so committed to the gospel.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.960]   And Paul is telling Timothy to do the same thing.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:20.160]   Be diligent, be committed, be engaged so that people will see your light and see the light
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.720]   of Christ.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:27.160]   The third thing that Paul is telling Timothy as a servant of the Lord, that what he must
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.880]   do is to set an example.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:38.160]   Now Paul first charged Timothy to come into ministry around 50 AD.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:44.560]   And we know that because that's when, you know, Acts chapter 16, we see that.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.200]   That's when Paul first enlisted Timothy as a teenager.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.120]   And so when first Timothy was written, he was probably around 30 years old, which was
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.000]   around mid 60 AD.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.400]   And so Paul was probably just around 30.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:09.360]   And so imagine Paul telling Timothy to lead church, this church in Ephesus, and some of
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.640]   the surrounding churches as well.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.680]   And he's only 30 years old.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:17.200]   And so there's going to be people that are older than him, right?
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:24.560]   And so he's telling Timothy to set an example in your speech, in your conduct, in your love,
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.720]   in your faith, and in your purity.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.040]   He tells, let's read verse 12 together in the next slide.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:40.200]   Let no one despise you in your youth, but set an example for the believers in speech,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.600]   in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:52.400]   Until I come, devote yourself to public reading of scripture, exhortation, and teaching.
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:59.640]   Paul is telling Timothy, I support you in leading the church.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.520]   So don't let anybody look down on you.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:08.840]   That's what the NIV says, or in EIV here, ESV here, it says, don't let anyone despise
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.520]   you.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:14.360]   Paul is giving Timothy a vote of confidence, right?
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:19.740]   Just like Pastor John gives us, you know, the pastoral team here, a vote of confidence
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:25.240]   to go and serve, right, us, Michelle and Pastor James to serve together.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.400]   He's great at encouraging us.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:34.720]   Paul is also telling Timothy, don't let anyone despise you because of your youth, because
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.760]   he has to teach against false teachings, right?
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.640]   And some of the wrong things that the people are doing at the church.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.380]   And so he's giving Timothy a vote of confidence.
[00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:52.220]   He's telling Timothy that he needs to set an example in his speech, right?
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:59.880]   His speech is to be humble, not, you know, so commanding, always, you know, being aggressive,
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.120]   or it has to be seasoned with salt.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.560]   He's telling Timothy that in his conduct, it has to be above reproach, that he has to
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.560]   be loving all people.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.480]   He has to set an example in how much he has faith in God.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.920]   And he has to set an example in his purity, in his integrity.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.360]   I remember when I first went on a mission trip, it was to the Czech Republic.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.440]   And I went with a bunch of people in my church.
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.000]   And I was actually the youngest person, all right?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.140]   We went over to a small little town called Lito Měžice, and we went to teach English.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.180]   We went to play sports with some of the high school teams there.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.280]   And we were playing basketball against some of the high school teams.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:48.480]   We were playing football against some of their football teams.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:54.520]   And I was the youngest person, but I was also the most athletic person in our team.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:59.240]   And so I had to lead our team, even though I was the youngest person, I was still in
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.760]   high school back then.
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.740]   I had to lead some of the older guys, let's partner together so that we can be a team,
[00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:11.320]   so that we could put up a fight against these well-trained high school students, high school
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:16.260]   Czech football and high school football and basketball team.
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.800]   And so I had to step up.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.080]   And you know, I wasn't that confident back then.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:28.440]   But over time, over a couple of those days, I had to grow in confidence.
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:34.500]   And people on my team were supporting me to go and lead us as we played against these
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.980]   other teams.
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.820]   And so Paul is telling Timothy that he needs to set an example.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:45.080]   And so when we serve the Lord as well, we represent Christ.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.000]   And we also need to set an example.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.380]   The last thing that Paul is telling Timothy is that he needs to be devoting himself to
[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.780]   the word of the Lord.
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:03.540]   Now Paul is telling him that he needs to have public reading of scripture.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.660]   Back then, they used to read the scriptures out loud, right?
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.320]   They didn't have, we all have our technology back net right now, right?
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:19.460]   We have our phones, we have all these different versions of the vones of the scriptures on
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.460]   our phones.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.500]   But back then, they didn't have the scriptures, it was in scrolls.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.420]   And so reading the scriptures was really important.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:32.380]   Jesus also read the scriptures out loud in the synagogue.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:38.180]   So Paul is telling Timothy, he needs to focus on the word of the Lord.
[00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:43.900]   And when we're reading it, not only that, we need to also preach and teach so that people
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.660]   would understand what it means.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:53.600]   And so when we're serving the Lord today, we need to make sure that what we are doing
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.580]   is ultimately preaching and teaching the word of God.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:01.180]   And our foundation is the word of the Lord.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:07.820]   And so Paul's charge to Timothy to serve comes with some responsibilities, as we see in the
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:14.660]   next slide, that we need to beware, beware of false teachings, beware of those who are
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.660]   deceiving.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.980]   We need to be watchful of our own lives.
[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.180]   We need to be watchful of our doctrine.
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:29.420]   Paul's charge to Timothy is that he needs to be training, just like an athletic competitor.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.700]   He needs to be training in godliness.
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.600]   We need to be diligent in our serving.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.500]   When we're serving, we need to be setting an example for our believers in speech, in
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:45.020]   life, in love, in faith, and in purity.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:50.080]   We need to be devoting ourselves to the word of the Lord.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:56.860]   The word of the Lord has to be our foundation in our service.
[00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:04.160]   The next slide shows us this saying, "The more we serve, the more we must reflect Christ."
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:10.300]   The more we serve, the more we must reflect Christ.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.820]   Because Christ is the one who has authority.
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.820]   We represent him.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.380]   We are his ambassadors.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:25.060]   And so whether we are ambassadors in our usual service, whether we are clicking PowerPoint
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:33.580]   or to being on the worship team or to service leading, to preaching, we must reflect Christ
[00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.940]   in all that we do, especially when we are serving.
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:45.040]   And the more we serve, the more we must reflect Christ.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:51.340]   In our society today, there are so many different people, right, that seek after money, that
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.740]   seek after power.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.380]   But what Paul is charging Timothy and what he's charging us today is that we need to
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:03.580]   be godly men and godly women.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:11.500]   Godly men and godly women must stand up and serve in our churches, in our societies, in
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:12.500]   our schools.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:19.620]   Yes, you know, me, Michelle, James, John, we are called to be pastors full-time.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:26.380]   And I believe that you are also a pastor to somebody, whether it's to your fellow students
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:33.240]   at school, that you are a pastor to the people around you at your workplace, whether it be
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:41.780]   your schools, your financial companies, your hospitals, your students that you're teaching,
[00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:48.980]   your architecture firms, your government places, you are a pastor to somebody.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:55.260]   And Paul's charge to Timothy is the same charge to us today, that we need to serve.
[00:19:55.260 --> 00:20:01.900]   And in order to serve, we need to be godly men and godly women.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.180]   And it doesn't mean that we'll always be perfect.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.980]   I'm not perfect.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.460]   You know, none of us here are perfect.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:16.160]   But we need to be depending on the Holy Spirit to sanctify us, to cleanse us, to make us
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.420]   more like him.
[00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:21.140]   And so I'm going to end on two questions today.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.020]   The first is, are you willing to serve?
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:31.740]   God has called each one of us to participate in this amazing body of Christ together.
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:37.740]   And it's not just for us to sit down and do nothing, not for 20% of the people to do 80%
[00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:38.740]   of the work.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:45.580]   No, he wants each one of us to participate in the body of Christ.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:49.380]   And he's not looking just for, you know, the older people to serve.
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:55.880]   No, he's looking for the younger people as well, to step up, to set an example, to become
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.580]   godly men and godly women.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.100]   Are you willing to serve the Lord?
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:10.060]   And in what areas do we need to prepare ourselves in order to serve him more?
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:14.700]   Is it in the word of God, understanding the word of God more?
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:19.260]   Is it being more watchful and beware of false teachings?
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:29.200]   Is it that we need to send an example or be more diligent in our training to become godly?
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.180]   Are you willing to serve the Lord?
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:39.920]   And if you are, are you willing to train and to work to become a godly man, godly woman
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:43.180]   that God has called you to be?
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.620]   Let us pray together.
[00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:54.300]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this calling that you've given to Timothy to be a servant,
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:02.340]   to serve, to be diligent, to be training, to be watchful, to set an example.
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.060]   And I pray for us today as well.
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:12.500]   You have called us to serve wherever you have called us to, whether it's our schools, our
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:18.140]   homes, our companies, our workplaces.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:26.340]   Prepare us, Lord, that we would be your light and your light would shine through us.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.740]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:29.340]   Amen.
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.920]   (upbeat music)
