1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
 Christmas, Christmas is on its way, finally, it's getting a little bit colder.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,640
 You know, actually coming back to KFC and walking through the Far East Finance Centre

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,800
 and seeing all the decorations, it really reminded me of four years ago, four years

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,040
 ago when we first came, my family and I, we first landed in Hong Kong just under four

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,000
 years ago, right, and we landed on I think on the 22nd of December or something like

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,680
 that and then the 23rd we came, we were just completely still jet-lagged, completely shocked,

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
 and we came to the pantry where you all were having your Christmas party.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,800
 So just stepping in and seeing all of it was just wow, how things have changed, how things

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,640
 have changed, but really, really glad to be back here, I've missed you all, I've been

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,480
 glad to be able to see all of you here today and how we've all grown in different ways.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,400
 Quite a lot has happened in these last few years, just tiny bits have happened and now

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,520
 we have Agnes who was the first person from church, actually the first person we met or

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,800
 saw in Hong Kong, she was at the airport waiting for us, didn't really know her well and now

14
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,560
 she's holding her grandchild from Alex and Joe, what a blessing it is.

15
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,200
 You guys have been going through the Book of 1 Corinthians, what a crazy book, it's

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,440
 one of my favourites growing up, admittedly I haven't spent as much time in it recently

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,960
 but I remember some key passages, for me I had 1 Corinthians 9.27 etched onto my basketball

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,920
 shoes when I was playing at university, I disciplined my body, training it to do what

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,520
 it should, lest after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.

20
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,480
 As you guys go through the whole of 1 Corinthians, this majestic book, I want to ask you a question,

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,100
 what would you say this letter has been about?

22
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,680
 As you've gone through all these different chapters, 15 chapters, what would you say

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,680
 the Book of 1 Corinthians is about?

24
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,200
 Now let me tell you what I think it's about, I think it's about how your faith impacts

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,560
 every element of your life, every single element, whether it's marriage, love, sex, how you

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,800
 deal with lawsuits, how you eat, how you worship, how you deal with your spiritual gifts, how

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,040
 you commit together as a church, 1 Corinthians tells you everything about how to live as

28
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,440
 a Christian.

29
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,480
 Some people I meet are like, "No James, no actually my faith side is this side, it's

30
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,000
 on my Saturday night or on my Sunday morning and then maybe I'll have one evening in the

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,960
 week where it's my Christian-y stuff but the work stuff, they don't really mix.

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,200
 I am a Christian, I do believe but then actually it's only this part of my life that it exists

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
 in."

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,720
 But the problem is, what Paul says in 1 Corinthians is, "No, that can't be the case.

35
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,280
 God has to infiltrate, has to impact every part of your life.

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,840
 There is no room that he cannot enter."

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,680
 And that's what 1 Corinthians is about and he finishes with this final chapter, the most

38
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,960
 majestic of all, the peak, the crown, the climax of 1 Corinthians and it's 1 Corinthians

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,940
 15 and it's about the topic of resurrection.

40
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:21,400
 In fact, this chapter here is described as the chapter on resurrection full stop in the

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,440
 whole Bible.

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,300
 If you want to find out anything about the resurrection, it's 1 Corinthians 15.

43
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,440
 So I invite you today to turn to 1 Corinthians 15.

44
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,600
 Maybe you have a paper Bible, if you have a phone as well, that's okay.

45
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,660
 I won't judge you but I will recommend that you get a paper Bible.

46
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,940
 These are great.

47
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,680
 They are constantly on do not disturb focus mode.

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,400
 There are no notifications coming at you and you can scribble on them and easily look up

49
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,400
 passages as well.

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,120
 Anyway, but 1 Corinthians 15 and I've cheekily not put them up on the screen so I would love

51
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,080
 for you to be able to follow along, scribble down notes, whatever you want, even on your

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,400
 apps, those are very good too.

53
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,400
 But follow along as we look at what it means, what the resurrection means.

54
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,280
 Verse 1, it starts off as this.

55
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,400
 He says, "Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you

56
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,560
 received and which you stand and by which you are being saved."

57
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
 He says, "I want to remind you something.

58
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,280
 You seem to have forgotten.

59
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,280
 You seem to have lost your way a little bit so I must remind you, I must rewind your mind

60
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,680
 back to what I had taught you and I want to tell you something that's very, very important

61
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,720
 because you've strayed away from it and it's about the resurrection."

62
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,080
 I want to give you a little bit of context here.

63
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,800
 Now, of course, you guys have been in this series for quite a long time so no doubt you'll

64
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,400
 know a little bit about the Church of Corinth.

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,280
 Paul's writing to this Church of Corinth, which he planted and he spent a lot of time

66
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,640
 there, and Corinth itself is a cosmopolitan city.

67
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,720
 People from all over the world would go into and descend into this city and it was filled

68
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,680
 with intellectuals, it was filled with businessmen, it was filled with very high-functioning,

69
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,240
 highly successful people, much like Hong Kong.

70
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,720
 Just down the road from Corinth, about 50 miles down, was the place called Athens.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,760
 Athens was this cultural centre, capital.

72
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,980
 Anyone who was anybody would go through Athens and Corinth.

73
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,280
 One of the big things about Athens and Corinth was this idea of Greek philosophy.

74
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
 Philosophers would go there.

75
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,840
 In London, there's this place called Speaker's Corner.

76
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,560
 Has anyone been to Speaker's Corner?

77
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,480
 Where very intellectual people will stand and debate and argue and spend a lot of time

78
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,720
 just talking and spitting at each other.

79
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,360
 Now, this was in some ways similar.

80
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,600
 Athens had that.

81
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,880
 It was that kind of vibe.

82
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,920
 And of course, it was so close to Corinth.

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,620
 So these two cities would constantly mix people.

84
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,280
 And the problem here is this.

85
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,920
 The believers in Corinth started to have some of the societal truths from the city of Corinth

86
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,720
 seep into their church, seep into the way they did church, seep into the way they were

87
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
 Christians.

88
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,120
 And they would say, "Oh, my God, that's ridiculous.

89
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,480
 The Bible should not be compromised in any way."

90
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,560
 But here's the thing.

91
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:07,200
 The churches that are based in cities so often, and we included, are at risk of being compromised

92
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,360
 by societal truths.

93
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,760
 How would you describe Hong Kong?

94
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,880
 Hong Kong is maybe a money-making city.

95
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,280
 It's a consumeristic city.

96
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,900
 It's a very corporate city.

97
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,360
 And you see how we have the risk of it.

98
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,040
 And I pray that our church does not have this.

99
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,400
 It has the risk of having those values seep into church life.

100
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,800
 This is exactly what happened in Corinth.

101
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,040
 The Greek philosophers, the way they thought, the way they argued, the way they debated,

102
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,640
 started seeping into the church of Corinth.

103
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,240
 And what was the one thing that they were arguing about?

104
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,080
 There cannot be, there is not a resurrection.

105
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,560
 They did not believe it.

106
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,600
 And so within the church, people were starting to think, "Oh, maybe there wasn't a resurrection.

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,880
 Maybe Jesus does all these things, and he was a great prophet, and he was a good guy.

108
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,200
 But maybe he didn't resurrect."

109
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,080
 Some of the people were using it to their advantage.

110
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,200
 Do you know how?

111
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,960
 They were saying, "Oh, the resurrection has already happened spiritually.

112
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,640
 We, our souls, have already resurrected and gone to heaven.

113
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,600
 Do you know what that means?

114
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,040
 What we do with our flesh physically here on earth doesn't matter.

115
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:19,380
 We can do whatever we want because we've already ascended spiritually into heaven.

116
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,320
 We can do whatever we want here and satisfy all the desires of our heart here."

117
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,040
 It was this over-realised eschatology saying, "Hey, we don't have to care about our bodies

118
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,960
 because our souls are done.

119
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,700
 It's time to play."

120
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,780
 So Paul's writing to these people, he's saying, "I want to remind you, I want to remind you

121
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,920
 about the resurrection.

122
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,000
 I want to ask you, how often do you think about the resurrection?"

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,860
 We sang some beautiful songs today, well chosen by Florence, about the resurrection.

124
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,440
 But sometimes we take that word for granted, "Oh yeah, Jesus died and rose again."

125
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,680
 Can we just pause for a second?

126
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
 What actually happened?

127
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:05,360
 That Jesus, this man, this fully human man died, but then he came back to life.

128
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,840
 So today I want to focus on that.

129
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,600
 I want to focus on what the resurrection really means as a truth.

130
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,080
 And there's really three kinds of aspects that we can look at this, and they're coming

131
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
 up on the slides right now.

132
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,580
 The three kinds of truths that the resurrection is, as we look into 1 Corinthians 15, is one,

133
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,640
 it's a historical truth.

134
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,400
 It's a historical truth.

135
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,780
 Number two, it's an essential truth.

136
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,420
 And number three, it's an applicable truth.

137
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,380
 Historical, essential and applicable truth.

138
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,520
 And I'll go through each one for us today.

139
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,780
 Verse three, chapter 15, verse three, it says this, "For I delivered to you as of first

140
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:45,280
 importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures

141
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,980
 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures."

142
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,580
 And we'll stop there for a second.

143
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,680
 Of first importance, what I received.

144
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,880
 So I'm not making this up.

145
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
 I'm not making this up.

146
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,880
 I didn't create this.

147
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,880
 I didn't write this.

148
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,760
 I received it and now I'm passing it on to you.

149
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,700
 And it's of the most importance.

150
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,220
 There are other parts of the faith, but this is the most important.

151
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,220
 What is it?

152
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:12,520
 In three short sentences, he basically sums up the gospel, the kerygma, which is what?

153
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:19,080
 Number one, Jesus Christ was buried, oh sorry, died for our sins according to the Scriptures.

154
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,560
 Jesus Christ died.

155
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,520
 Not too shocking right now because everyone dies.

156
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,680
 We will all die.

157
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,400
 Jesus Christ died, but he didn't just die just for giggles.

158
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,400
 He died for our sins, number two.

159
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,860
 Sorry, still part of number one actually, 1B.

160
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,760
 He died for our sins and 1C is according to the Scriptures.

161
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,520
 So what he's saying here is number one, Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the

162
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
 Scriptures.

163
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,920
 He's saying Jesus died according to the Scriptures saying, "I'm not making this up.

164
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,680
 I'm not making this up."

165
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,200
 This was a prophecy from hundreds of years ago.

166
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,680
 What was he probably thinking of?

167
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,720
 Maybe Isaiah 53.

168
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,320
 Maybe some of you don't know Isaiah 53.

169
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,220
 Maybe you know the song that we've sang more recently, Man of Sorrows.

170
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,400
 He was pierced for our transgressions.

171
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,040
 The sinless man died as a ransom for many.

172
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,200
 He's probably thinking about that.

173
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
 That's number one.

174
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,040
 Number two, he said he was buried in a tomb.

175
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,600
 Just like a normal living human being, he died and then he was buried in a tomb.

176
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,800
 And you've heard about this tomb because it was a tomb that was bought by Josephus.

177
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,280
 So even historians who aren't Christians know that Jesus Christ, this man existed and that

178
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,800
 he died and was buried in a tomb.

179
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,880
 Number three, on the third day he rose again.

180
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,600
 Again, according to the Scriptures.

181
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 That's what he's saying.

182
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,600
 He repeats it again saying, "This is a prophecy.

183
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,960
 This isn't something that I'm making up.

184
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,480
 This man died and he rose again."

185
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
 What prophecies was he thinking about?

186
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,040
 What Scriptures was he thinking about?

187
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,400
 Maybe Jonah.

188
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,760
 Maybe how Jonah wasn't allowed to stay in the belly of the fish for three days, but

189
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,120
 rose again after three days.

190
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
 Came out of the fish.

191
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,360
 Jesus Christ himself referenced Jonah.

192
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,600
 Jesus Christ himself said, "The Son of Man will die, but in three days will come back."

193
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,480
 He's saying, "We're not making this up."

194
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,820
 It's according to the Scriptures.

195
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,780
 There's been days of about 300 prophecies in the Old Testament pointing to Jesus, pointing

196
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,220
 to what he did.

197
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,540
 So it is historical truth.

198
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,140
 I want to pause here and I'm going to ask you a question.

199
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,820
 Why are you a Christian?

200
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:25,900
 Why are you Gordon, Florence, Cherry, Julie, why are you a Christian?

201
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,220
 Have a think about that for a second.

202
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,100
 Maybe someone's asked you that at work.

203
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,940
 Why are you a Christian?

204
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,540
 Maybe the most common answer is, "Well, I was born into a Christian family and so went

205
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,720
 to church from a young age, went to Sunday school, and then maybe kind of got more serious

206
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,780
 as I went to university."

207
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,020
 Or maybe, "I'm a Christian because actually I just want to be a good person.

208
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,060
 I want to be a good person, so I'm a Christian."

209
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,180
 Or maybe you're a Christian because you're like, "I really like, I think it's a really

210
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,500
 good philosophy to go by.

211
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,340
 It's a really good set of values.

212
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,660
 It's a good way of life.

213
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
 Christianity good."

214
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,820
 Christians are fairly nice, most of them.

215
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,420
 So I want to be a Christian.

216
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:11,020
 Let me tell you why you should be a Christian.

217
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,060
 Let me tell you why we should all be a Christian.

218
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,660
 Let me tell you the primary reason why we should be a Christian.

219
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:24,300
 Because someone died and rose again.

220
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,200
 Christianity, primarily, the reason why you believe in it is because you believe that

221
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,500
 someone died and rose again.

222
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,660
 Paul's saying here, "If that person didn't die, nothing else matters."

223
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,640
 That is the most important piece.

224
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,100
 You believe in Christianity because it's true, because it happened, because 2,000 years ago

225
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,380
 there was a man who came who was the Son of God, who died for the sins of many, was buried

226
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:53,780
 in a tomb, but then left the tomb and rose again on the third day.

227
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
 That's why you're a Christian.

228
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,820
 Have you thought about it like that?

229
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,540
 That you're a Christian, not because it's a nice way to live, you're a Christian because

230
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:07,920
 something happened that snapped time into half and changed the course of humanity completely

231
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,260
 because someone died and rose again and defied the laws of science.

232
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,940
 It's a historical truth.

233
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,220
 There's an empty tomb to prove it.

234
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,920
 But then you might say, "Well, actually, the empty tomb, maybe the soldiers that were guarding

235
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,220
 the tomb were bribed.

236
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,260
 Maybe they were just given a little bit of money, 'Hey, let us take this body and we

237
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,940
 can do a little conspiracy thing with it.'"

238
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,340
 But you see, the problem is this.

239
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,260
 Soldiers those days, if they were entrusted to guard a prison or guard a tomb, they had

240
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,660
 to guard it with their lives.

241
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,940
 If anything happened or if anything happened on their watch that was wrong, that was bad,

242
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,940
 what would happen?

243
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,900
 That soldier would have to be put to death, as well as their family.

244
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,980
 Suddenly, you think, "Well, that doesn't make sense then because why would they take in

245
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,260
 any money?"

246
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,620
 Because their whole family would die.

247
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,620
 It's not the soldiers.

248
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,400
 But then you think, "Oh, actually, maybe it's the Pharisees or the Romans."

249
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,220
 Because they had heard the whispers that these Jesus followers were starting to say, "Jesus

250
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
 is going to rise again.

251
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,220
 Jesus is going to rise again.

252
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,220
 You know what?

253
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,220
 The best way to guarantee that doesn't happen?

254
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,040
 Let's take the body away."

255
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,260
 Then they can't do anything with it.

256
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
 "We'll protect it.

257
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,260
 We'll guard it."

258
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,460
 You know, maybe that makes sense.

259
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:21,380
 But then it doesn't because at any moment then, as Christianity was growing and eventually

260
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,060
 outgrows the whole Roman Empire, at any moment, they could have brought the body back out

261
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,300
 and said, "Actually, guys, that Jesus isn't alive.

262
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
 Here's the body.

263
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,940
 We did take him away for safekeeping, but he's here now.

264
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:35,380
 So all of you can just pipe down."

265
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,580
 So it can't be the Pharisees and it can't really be the Romans.

266
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,380
 What about the followers of Jesus themselves?

267
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,660
 Could they even find, "Hey, maybe they're just grieving from wasting three years following

268
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,980
 this man and now he's gone.

269
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,260
 And now suddenly they've lost their jobs, they've lost their families, they've lost

270
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,420
 everything, and so they're like, 'You know what?

271
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,380
 I'm grieving and I'm in denial.

272
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,180
 Let's take the body and let's make up something.

273
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
 Let's just keep faith.'"

274
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,340
 Again, that's kind of like, "Oh, that kind of makes sense."

275
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:09,780
 Until you think for the next 40 years, those people were willing to die for this faith.

276
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,020
 Surely at one point, when someone was being tortured or beaten or persecuted or just about

277
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,400
 to die, surely they would have been like, "You know what?

278
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,740
 It was all a joke.

279
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,380
 It was just, we were just having a little fun."

280
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,180
 Like he's not resurrected.

281
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,380
 But that's not the case.

282
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,620
 He actually transformed something.

283
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,900
 There's this quote, and I want to read it to you.

284
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
 I think it's going to be on the slides.

285
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,900
 It's by this guy called Charles Colson.

286
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,500
 He was an attorney and he was a political advisor during the President Nixon era.

287
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,540
 And he said this about the Watergate scandal.

288
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,500
 Do we know what the Watergate scandal is?

289
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,700
 Maybe anyone who's under 30 may not know.

290
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,300
 It was a political scandal in the US, which back then was a big thing, but nowadays probably

291
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
 not so much.

292
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,100
 But anyway, this Charles Colson said this, "I know the resurrection is a fact and Watergate,

293
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,620
 the scandal, proved it to me."

294
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
 How?

295
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,700
 "Because 12 men testified they had seen Jesus raised from the dead.

296
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:07,220
 Then they proclaimed that truth for 40 years, never once denying it.

297
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,100
 Everyone was beaten, tortured, stoned, and put in prison.

298
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,780
 They would not have endured that if it weren't true.

299
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,020
 Watergate embroiled 12 of the most powerful men in the world, and they couldn't keep

300
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,660
 a lie for three weeks."

301
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:28,060
 You're telling me 12 apostles, fishermen, all kinds of people could keep a lie for 40

302
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,060
 years?

303
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,740
 Absolutely impossible.

304
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,140
 The resurrection is a historical truth.

305
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,140
 Furthermore, on top of the empty tomb, there were witnesses.

306
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,900
 And Paul talks about those witnesses, and he starts in verse 5, "And that he appeared

307
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,540
 to Cephas," which is Peter, "then to the 12.

308
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,060
 Then he appeared to more than 500 brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive,

309
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,840
 though some have fallen asleep.

310
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,420
 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.

311
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,620
 Last of all, he appeared to me."

312
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,620
 Paul.

313
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:03,120
 He's saying, not only is there an empty tomb, not only are there witnesses, but these witnesses

314
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,860
 were completely transformed.

315
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,300
 He mentions Peter, saying Peter saw him.

316
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,100
 Do you remember what Peter was like when Jesus was around?

317
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,100
 Or maybe when Jesus was arrested?

318
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,900
 Do you remember what that Peter was like?

319
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,220
 He was like, "No, I don't know him.

320
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,220
 I don't know him.

321
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,540
 No, he must be mistaking me for someone else."

322
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,540
 He was obnoxious.

323
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,540
 He was impulsive.

324
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,980
 What was the Peter like in Acts?

325
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,740
 The one who Jesus built the church on.

326
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,380
 That was a completely different Peter.

327
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,820
 Something happened pre-Peter, pre-Jesus' death, and post-Jesus' death, Peter was completely

328
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
 transformed.

329
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:33,820
 Do you remember James?

330
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,260
 James as in Jesus' brother.

331
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,740
 Scripture actually says, "Jesus' family, his brothers, didn't believe that he was God."

332
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,940
 Of course, I don't blame them.

333
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,940
 Why would you?

334
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,780
 If my brother kept going around saying that I'm the Son of God, you actually wouldn't

335
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,460
 believe him.

336
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,500
 But then what happened?

337
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:57,060
 He saw his own brother die on a cross, and then in three days' time, he saw him again.

338
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060
 That transforms James.

339
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:05,580
 And then he says, "And 500 people, some of which are still alive," because this was written

340
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,860
 about 20 years after Jesus.

341
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
 What's Paul saying here?

342
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,380
 There's 500 people who saw him.

343
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,380
 Find them.

344
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,380
 They're still around.

345
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,340
 Some of them have died, but some of them are still around.

346
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,340
 Ask them.

347
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,660
 If this was a lie, he wouldn't have said that.

348
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,780
 There were witnesses, and furthermore, these witnesses were completely transformed.

349
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,500
 Most of all, final one of all at this point, Paul himself.

350
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,300
 Who was Paul before he was Paul?

351
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:35,980
 Saul, the persecutor of the church, the one who stood and watched Stephen, a man, proclaim

352
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,180
 the gospel and get stoned to death.

353
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,300
 That's Saul.

354
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,700
 Now, from being the biggest persecutor of the church, becomes the most prolific church

355
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,580
 planter ever.

356
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,060
 Something happened.

357
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,520
 His explanation, his reason, is that he met Jesus.

358
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,900
 He met Jesus, the resurrected one.

359
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,940
 First of all, why you believe in Christianity is because of the resurrection, because this

360
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,020
 resurrection is a historical truth.

361
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,580
 It actually happens.

362
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,020
 Number two, it's an essential truth.

363
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,020
 It's an essential truth.

364
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,900
 Now, I just said that Christianity isn't about giving you a better way of life.

365
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,540
 It isn't about giving you an emotional crutch so you can feel better about yourself as you

366
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,620
 navigate the challenges of this world.

367
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,860
 It's not just about that.

368
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,460
 Now, those things are fruits of believing in Christ and getting that hope, but it's

369
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,900
 not the main thing.

370
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,580
 Just because you get a better life here, it doesn't address the biggest issue that we

371
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,580
 all have.

372
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,580
 And what are those issues?

373
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,860
 That is sin and death.

374
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,920
 We are all sinners.

375
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,580
 We are all needing of a saviour.

376
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,340
 I know this is a really somber Christmas message.

377
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,180
 Merry Christmas.

378
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,080
 You're a sinner and you need saving.

379
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,060
 And your sin will lead you to death.

380
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:59,020
 And Romans 6 says this, "And the wages of sin is death."

381
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,460
 Because we are sinners, because we've made mistakes, because we're not perfect, we don't

382
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,420
 have a chance getting into the perfect heaven.

383
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:12,420
 Because of what we've done, there is a price that must be paid.

384
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:18,420
 The death and resurrection of Jesus addresses the issue of sin and death.

385
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,540
 It's an essential truth.

386
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,340
 You can't get away from it.

387
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,260
 You cannot get away from it.

388
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,260
 Why?

389
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,020
 Because the moment Adam sinned, the moment Adam, well, the moment Adam did not have a

390
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:35,100
 brain of his own and just listened to what he was told to do and just took a bite of

391
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,340
 the apple, the moment he turned away from God and felt shame, he sinned, what happened

392
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,660
 was he put humanity under death's power.

393
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,460
 From that moment, he turned his back on God and the biggest problem with sin is that we

394
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,940
 are now separated from God.

395
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
 Think about God.

396
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,540
 God is the source of life, hope, joy, and love.

397
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,460
 Surely then, the worst thing that could possibly happen to any of us is being separated from

398
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,340
 those things and through sin, that's what happens.

399
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,460
 When we choose to turn ourselves away from God, that is sin and that is when we are separated

400
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,460
 from God.

401
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:19,100
 That's why Jesus had to die because that price had to be paid.

402
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,300
 That bill had to be settled and through the death, he atoned for our sins.

403
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,780
 I talked about this before and we sang about it.

404
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,780
 Atonement.

405
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,580
 Jesus' death brings us atonement and what is atonement?

406
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,100
 At-one-ment.

407
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,900
 It brings us back.

408
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,960
 From the moment we were separated, from the moment of Adam, atonement, Jesus dying, brings

409
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
 us back.

410
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,220
 So Jesus' death addresses the issue of sin and the resurrection addresses the issue of

411
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,220
 death.

412
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,980
 Up until then, death has had the final say.

413
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,820
 Right now, we all will die and we think that's the final say but in the resurrection, we

414
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:01,180
 find out that actually death doesn't have the final say because what does the resurrection

415
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,620
 tell you?

416
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:09,100
 Someone died, told us he would do that, then he came back to life.

417
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,020
 That means there's something beyond the grave.

418
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,420
 Someone died and rose again, which means there's something beyond the grave, which means our

419
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,780
 greatest fear that we're going to die and go into the abyss and be separated isn't true

420
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,220
 because there's something that happens after the grave and that someone wasn't just anyone.

421
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:32,900
 It was the sinless one who paid for our sins and then he rose again.

422
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,080
 What significance does that have?

423
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,500
 Because he said that he was going to die and rise again and then it actually happened,

424
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,380
 well, I'll tell you what this means.

425
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,220
 He can be trusted.

426
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,680
 If I told you, "Guys, I'm going to die tonight but don't worry.

427
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,760
 I'm going to come back in three days and next week I'll be back here and then you actually

428
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,180
 see me die and then next week you see me back," I think you're going to pay attention to me.

429
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,620
 Pay attention to what I'm going to say, at least more than right now because Jesus put

430
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,900
 his money where his mouth was.

431
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,660
 讲得出,做得到.

432
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,700
 This interesting quote from Tim Keller, I think it's also on the screen, I'll read it

433
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,700
 to you.

434
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:15,080
 "If Jesus rose from the dead, then you have to accept all that he said.

435
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,540
 If he didn't rise from the dead, then why worry about any of what he said?

436
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,940
 The issue on which everything hangs is not whether or not you like his teaching, but

437
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,700
 whether or not he rose from the dead."

438
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,900
 The issue on which everything hangs is not whether or not you like his teaching, but

439
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:37,700
 whether or not he rose from the dead.

440
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,540
 And Paul then says this, he said, "Look, if you're saying that there is no resurrection

441
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,460
 from the dead and Jesus didn't rise from the dead, I'll tell you what this means."

442
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,740
 In verse 14, he starts a list and we'll fly through it.

443
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,740
 He says, verse 14, "And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain

444
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,300
 and your faith is in vain.

445
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:01,260
 If Jesus didn't die and rise again, me standing here preaching is completely pointless.

446
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,260
 It doesn't mean a single thing.

447
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,020
 However good I am at speaking, however good I make you feel, however many tips about life

448
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,260
 to help you feel better, it does not matter.

449
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,460
 All of it is in vain.

450
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,420
 Your faith is also in vain."

451
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,140
 And carries on, "We are even found to be misrepresenting God because we testify about

452
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,420
 God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise, if it is true that the dead are not

453
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
 raised."

454
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,100
 If Jesus didn't rise from the dead, we're actually all false witnesses.

455
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
 We're all liars.

456
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,100
 We're all liars.

457
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,740
 "For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised and if Christ has not

458
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,460
 been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins."

459
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,700
 Because that means your sin hasn't been addressed.

460
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,900
 That means the wage hasn't been paid.

461
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,500
 The debt hasn't been paid.

462
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,480
 You are still in your sins and you are still heading to death and you are still heading

463
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,860
 to eternal separation.

464
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:56,860
 But someone said that he is the resurrection and the life and then showed us that he actually

465
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
 is.

466
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,020
 That changes everything.

467
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,180
 It changes everything.

468
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,900
 Paul's also not saying, hey, he's not just saying, remember, Christ Jesus died and rose

469
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,900
 again.

470
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,900
 That's not the only thing he's saying.

471
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,740
 What else is he saying?

472
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:19,780
 He's saying because Christ died and rose again, so will you.

473
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,940
 That brothers and sisters is the game changer.

474
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:30,980
 Because Christ died and rose again, so will you.

475
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:40,580
 Imagine if you truly believed and lived as though your death is not final.

476
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:46,380
 Every year for Reuben's birthday, we like to take him somewhere fun and one of the main

477
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,060
 things he loves is going laser questing.

478
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,060
 Anyone like laser questing here?

479
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,060
 A couple of us.

480
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,060
 I love laser quest.

481
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:58,420
 I'm a bit too much of a wimp to go paintballing because that actually hurts.

482
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,660
 The BB gunning really kind of hurts, especially if it clips the back of your ear as well.

483
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,740
 But laser quest is great.

484
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,740
 Why is laser quest great?

485
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:16,300
 And then someone shoots me, and then in five seconds, and I'm back again.

486
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,660
 Now if you take it further, there's laser quest and then more hardcore, there's paintballing

487
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,260
 and of course I'm nowhere near real battle and real war where you only get one chance

488
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:28,540
 and once you get that chance, you've got a gun.

489
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:34,060
 Imagine though if you lived in a way where you didn't fear death anymore.

490
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,620
 Just imagine what that is like.

491
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,260
 There's a song that we sang that alluded to this, that even though your outer self is

492
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,900
 wasting away, your inner self is being renewed day by day.

493
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,060
 That what you're going to receive is this eternal weight of glory that doesn't compare

494
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,580
 to anything that you're going to struggle with here.

495
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:57,580
 Nothing that can happen to you here is going to hurt you in eternity.

496
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:05,180
 Imagine just for a moment that you get to live life like that, without this fear of

497
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,780
 death.

498
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,860
 What does that do to you?

499
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,580
 Which leads me to my final point.

500
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,140
 The resurrection is a historical truth, it's an essential truth because it addresses sin

501
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,860
 and death and finally, it's an applicable truth.

502
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,860
 And this is my conclusion, because you might be saying here, "Okay, fine, James, you're

503
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,860
 telling me that this Jewish man existed 2,000 years ago, proclaimed that he is God, he died

504
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,140
 and he rose again.

505
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,140
 Great.

506
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,540
 And then he flew off into the clouds, into the heavens.

507
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,140
 What does that mean for me now?

508
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,100
 What does that do for me now?"

509
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,700
 And I want to say, have a think about this.

510
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,340
 Not only is it a historical truth and an essential truth for your eternal salvation, there's

511
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,060
 something that it can do for you right here and right now.

512
00:27:52,060 --> 00:28:00,900
 If the issue that it addresses is sin and death, what it unlocks then is freedom and

513
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,820
 life.

514
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,260
 If the issue that the death and resurrection addresses is sin and death, that means the

515
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:14,540
 result, the application here is that you will have freedom and life and no more sin and

516
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,740
 death.

517
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,780
 And so I continue to ask you, imagine what it is like if you lived as though your body

518
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,100
 might be dying, but you'll always be alive.

519
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,460
 It's a song quote from Phil Wickham.

520
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,300
 Imagine if that was the case.

521
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,460
 Well, first of all, it will change the way you live.

522
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,060
 Finally, you will have purpose to live because you're like, "Well, this isn't all there is.

523
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:41,420
 I'm living here in this little bit, but I've got all this to look out for, to look forward

524
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
 to."

525
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:48,260
 I went on a retreat this week and I went to Toronto and we walked past Sayoun and you kept

526
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,740
 going up, kept going up, and then there's a cemetery.

527
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,740
 Has anyone been there?

528
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,620
 There's a cemetery and me and my friend, we were just stood behind the cemetery and we

529
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,460
 were seeing all these kind of these graves, but it was only a short part of it because

530
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:07,420
 after the graves would be a railing and then it was just ocean, sky and mountain.

531
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,660
 And I was like, "I think I'm stuck here right now between these graves."

532
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,820
 And in Hong Kong, they're extra tight.

533
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:20,940
 And it's extra busy and it's extra gloomy, but this is just a small part of it.

534
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:27,940
 We've not reached eternity shore where if we step through those, we see this vast expanse.

535
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,660
 This eternity awaits us that allows us to...

536
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:37,780
 Jesus said in John 10, 10, he said, "And I will give you life and life to the full."

537
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,700
 And he's not just talking about this life here because this is so small.

538
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,180
 Imagine that his vantage point, that this is so small.

539
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,300
 If you put your trust in me, you'll have something called eternal life, which will be all of

540
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:54,780
 this and you won't be trapped in this cemetery any longer.

541
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,060
 Imagine the freedom that that gives you.

542
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,780
 Imagine that how that helps you approach death.

543
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:05,300
 Who's had a death to a loved one in the family before?

544
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,740
 Of course, as you grow old, it's inevitable because every single person that you know

545
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:14,420
 will die.

546
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:20,660
 But imagine if you truly believed that Christ raised from the dead and you will too, and

547
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,900
 that the loved ones who he lifts inside will also rise from the dead too.

548
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,620
 That changes the way you grieve.

549
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:33,900
 That changes the way you deal with loss.

550
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,900
 Paul says in 1 Thessalonians, he says, "We don't grieve like those who have no hope."

551
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:40,940
 We grieve in a different way.

552
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,500
 We grieve that we don't get to spend these next few decades with our loved one.

553
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:54,020
 But we grieve with hope because someone died and rose again.

554
00:30:54,020 --> 00:31:00,420
 And we believe that same power now lives in those who love and follow him.

555
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,380
 That changes how you approach funerals now.

556
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,300
 That changes how you live now.

557
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,740
 That is an applicable truth right now.

558
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,460
 You'll also be free from sin.

559
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,340
 Paul's talking to these people and rebuking them, saying, "You've lost sight of the resurrection

560
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,300
 and now you're just giving in to your own desires."

561
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,420
 The problem is this.

562
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,660
 If you follow that path and giving in to your own desires, where does it lead you?

563
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,980
 Of course, it leads you to death.

564
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,300
 But before that, actually, you find that maybe temporarily it's fun.

565
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,680
 Maybe the first few months it's fun.

566
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,140
 Maybe even the first few years it's fun.

567
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,140
 But look around.

568
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
 Look around at society.

569
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,440
 Look around at the people that we see, the rich and the famous, all those who get every

570
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,220
 desire satisfied.

571
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,740
 Do they look happy to you?

572
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,860
 Do they look fulfilled to you?

573
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:45,740
 Do they look like they're living life to the full to you?

574
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,060
 No.

575
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,940
 And so because of the resurrection, because of this eternal perspective you get, you now

576
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,980
 get to live life in a different way.

577
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:57,860
 You get to be free from the sins that corrupt you.

578
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:05,060
 Your sin has been defeated because the resurrection now has the final say.

579
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,080
 That is the game changer.

580
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,540
 That is the thing that stops you from worrying.

581
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,180
 Who's a worrier here?

582
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,020
 I'm a worrier.

583
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,620
 Always thinking about what could happen.

584
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,060
 Always thinking about missing out on something, missing a deadline, missing something and

585
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,140
 then suddenly the whole world is going to fall apart.

586
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:27,340
 The resurrection tells you nothing will fall apart because Christ Jesus broke himself and

587
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:33,500
 put himself back together and put us back together too.

588
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:39,060
 So you don't have to worry and Jesus says this in Matthew 6, he says don't worry.

589
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:45,420
 The sparrows, the lilies, I'm looking after them and I'll look after you.

590
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,260
 Why can you believe me?

591
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:52,780
 I'm going to show you because I'll subject myself to the most horrible torment and the

592
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,620
 offence and the crucifixion and I'll come back to life.

593
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,900
 Then you will trust me, then you will believe me that I am the resurrection and the life

594
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,460
 that you don't have to worry about a thing.

595
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,420
 The Barnard group recently did a study.

596
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:13,380
 Do you know what the most commonly highlighted Bible verse in the whole of the Bible is?

597
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,980
 John 3, 16, "For God so loved the world."

598
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:17,980
 No.

599
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,460
 Romans 8, 28, "And God will work for the good of those who love him."

600
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
 No.

601
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,220
 Philippians 4, 4-7, "Do not be anxious about anything."

602
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,220
 You probably have this as a fridge magnet.

603
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:35,020
 "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with

604
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:40,060
 thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses

605
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,500
 all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds."

606
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,860
 We love that verse.

607
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
 We love it.

608
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,860
 Why?

609
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,220
 Because we're worriers.

610
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,860
 And so it's telling us don't be anxious.

611
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,020
 Don't worry.

612
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,660
 There's a few words just before that fridge magnet verse that tells you the secret why

613
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,660
 you don't need to worry.

614
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,860
 Does anyone know what it is?

615
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,580
 The Lord is at hand.

616
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:14,060
 Or another version is the Lord is near.

617
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,020
 Do not be anxious about anything.

618
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,300
 That's the key.

619
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,340
 That's what the resurrection can do for you if you're a worrier.

620
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,940
 You can remind yourself, "Well, I'm not worshipping a dead God.

621
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,340
 I'm not worshipping a God who couldn't save himself.

622
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:34,180
 I'm worshipping a God who plucked himself from the grave and now stands next to me and

623
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,620
 the Lord is at hand.

624
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,020
 He is near to me.

625
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,820
 So I don't have to be anxious about anything because he's right here."

626
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,820
 Isn't that freeing?

627
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,820
 Isn't that amazing?

628
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,100
 And the very final verse of this chapter, well, towards the end of it, verse 58.

629
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:53,540
 Oh, actually, here's the very end.

630
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,660
 "Therefore."

631
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,980
 That is the biggest therefore ever.

632
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,500
 We see therefore all the time.

633
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,620
 And of course, Bible teachers will teach you when you see the word therefore, you must

634
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,540
 ask why is it therefore?

635
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
 What's it therefore?

636
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
 What's the context?

637
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,580
 That is the biggest therefore you will find because that's saying if someone died and

638
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,780
 rose again, therefore.

639
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,980
 This is how you live.

640
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,540
 Can we sense the weight of what that means?

641
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,860
 How the resurrection can apply into every aspect of your life.

642
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,980
 And this is how he sums up the whole book.

643
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:33,020
 "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of

644
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:37,820
 the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labour is not in vain.

645
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,500
 Therefore, because someone rose from the dead, you can be steadfast.

646
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,500
 You don't need to worry.

647
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,380
 You don't need to be afraid anymore."

648
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,460
 Psalm 27, "The Lord is my light and my salvation.

649
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,940
 He is the stronghold of my life.

650
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
 Whom shall I fear?

651
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,580
 I don't have to be afraid because He's the stronghold of my life.

652
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:01,060
 He is my light and my salvation and He is here.

653
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,940
 And so I can abound in work for the Lord, which means I can grow in my work for the

654
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,940
 Lord, which means I don't have to work for earthly things, just earthly things anymore.

655
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:16,940
 I can work because there are eternal consequences to be gained, eternal rewards to be gained.

656
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,540
 So none of it is in vain because what we're doing here is this and what we're going to

657
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,420
 be experiencing is all of this.

658
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,860
 So be steadfast.

659
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,100
 Don't worry.

660
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,100
 Be immovable.

661
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:36,660
 Don't be afraid because someone died and rose again and is now standing next to you."

662
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:44,420
 All of this because of the resurrection.

663
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,380
 The resurrection that is historical truth.

664
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,100
 It actually happened.

665
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:54,420
 The resurrection because it is essential truth, because it addresses our sin and death and

666
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,820
 gives us life and freedom.

667
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,700
 The resurrection which is applicable truth.

668
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,220
 Right now, there is something in your life that you can apply this resurrection truth

669
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,220
 to.

670
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:08,820
 Literally everything can start with the resurrection.

671
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:14,620
 And you might be like, "James, okay, this is good, but you've got the seasons wrong.

672
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,580
 It's Christmas, not Easter."

673
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:21,340
 But you see, here's the thing.

674
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:28,540
 Christmas isn't really about a baby being born in a manger.

675
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:32,260
 That's not why we celebrate Christmas because I'm sure he wasn't the only baby being born

676
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,780
 in a manger.

677
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:41,620
 Christmas is not about a baby being born in a manger.

678
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,620
 The reason why we celebrate Christmas is because that baby didn't stay in the manger.

679
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,140
 The reason we celebrate Christmas and have all these carols is because that baby didn't

680
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:56,100
 stay in the manger and ended up growing up to be the sinless man and then ended up on

681
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,100
 the cross.

682
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,540
 But we celebrate Christmas not because that man stayed on the cross and ended up in a

683
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,180
 tomb, but because he didn't stay there either.

684
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,900
 We celebrate Christmas because this sinless man that started in a manger, ended up on

685
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,700
 a cross and then in a tomb, didn't stay there and then rose again.

686
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,580
 And there is now an empty tomb to prove it.

687
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,780
 That is why we celebrate Christmas.

688
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:29,280
 The fact that there is an empty tomb remains to this day.

689
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:36,740
 The fact that there is an empty tomb remains to this day and that fact changes everything.

690
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,740
 Do we get that?

691
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,260
 Let me say that one more time and not if you get this.

692
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:50,780
 The fact that there is an empty tomb remains unchanged and that fact changes everything.

693
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:53,920
 That is why we celebrate Christmas.

694
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,800
 That is why we rejoice because we no longer have to be afraid, we no longer have to worry,

695
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,140
 we are free from sin, we are free from death, death no longer has its sting all because

696
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,540
 someone died and then rose again.

697
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,100
 And now he is with us.

698
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:20,100
 This Christmas season, God is with us, Emmanuel.

699
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,620
 How can we respond today?

700
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:30,980
 We stretch out our hands and we say, Emmanuel, come into my life.

701
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:35,180
 O come, O come, Emmanuel.

702
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:40,580
 I am going to invite the worship band up now and as I pray, I invite us all, why don't

703
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:47,780
 we, just as Alex led us today earlier in lifting our hands up to worship, can we just open

704
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:58,100
 our hands now as we close our eyes and can we welcome this saviour in?

705
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:04,620
 Emmanuel, God with us.

706
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:11,820
 And as I pray for all of us, allow that truth of the resurrection to seep into your very

707
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,500
 heart, soul and mind.

708
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:24,700
 Jesus we talk and sing about your resurrection all the time, but forgive us that we take

709
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,940
 it for granted what it really means.

710
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,420
 Because now we know what the resurrection means, it means that you are living and here

711
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:40,860
 with us and we dare not forget that, we do not want to forget that.

712
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:47,420
 Emmanuel, you are God with us, so come.

713
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,300
 Come into our hearts, come into our minds and our souls.

714
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,140
 If there are any rooms that you don't feel as though you can come in, thank you for being

715
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:07,140
 patient and just gracious and just knocking on our door.

716
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:17,740
 If anyone here feels that there is a room that the saviour has not been in yet, if you

717
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:24,100
 feel as though there is something that you are holding back from this living Christ,

718
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:38,620
 this living God, then I want to tell you today, he died, he rose and now he is here and he

719
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:46,460
 is knocking on your door, asking for you to invite him in.

720
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:57,460
 And the only appropriate response is to say, "Come on in."

721
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:02,620
 Oh come, oh come, Emmanuel.

722
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,200
 (gentle music)
