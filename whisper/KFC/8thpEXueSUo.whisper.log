[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   >>
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.440]   Have you ever been to one of these events
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.380]   where the organiser
[00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.480]   feels you need an icebreaker
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.520]   in order to
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.320]   get the atmosphere
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.660]   and you get told to find
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.420]   somebody
[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.420]   you don't know?
[00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.820]   And you then tell them
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.660]   three things about yourself.
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.200]   Two things are true and one is false.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.740]   And you have to guess which one is false.
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.100]   And in the process,
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.640]   your new friend
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.240]   has got to know you a little better.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.340]   Now, my favourite icebreaker is this one.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.540]   If they were to make a film
[00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.080]   about you and your life,
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.980]   who would you choose?
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.880]   Who do you think I could choose?
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.800]   Any suggestions?
[00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.460]   If they were making a film about my life,
[00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.460]   you weren't listening,
[00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.360]   and I had to choose anyone to play me,
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.700]   who would I play me?
[00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.840]   Who?
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.800]   Andy Lyle.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.340]   That's interesting.
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.680]   I must look very local.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.180]   That's good.
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.080]   Anybody else?
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080]   Any other guesses?
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.180]   Sir Patrick Stewart.
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.320]   Okay, that's interesting.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.460]   He's about 90, isn't he?
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.260]   I don't know.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.960]   Anybody else?
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.020]   Any other guesses?
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.020]   Bobby Charlton.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.920]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.720]   Well, okay.
[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.760]   All right.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:41.560]   Look, I've resisted George Clooney.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.780]   And resisted Colin Firth.
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780]   And I take into account
[00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.620]   my slightly crazy personality.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.880]   I've chosen Jim Carrey.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.120]   An outrageous extrovert,
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.180]   if ever I saw one.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.860]   Some love him, some hate him,
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.120]   but there's no denying
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.060]   that Jim Carrey is funny.
[00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.400]   I mean, what's your favorite Jim Carrey film?
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.000]   Any suggestions?
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.540]   Maybe "Dumb and Dumber."
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.900]   Maybe "The Mask."
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.340]   Maybe "The Cable Guy."
[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.380]   Oh, yes, and "The Truman Show."
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.040]   But my favorite,
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.440]   thanks for the spoiler alert,
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.020]   is "Liar, Liar," made in 1997.
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.600]   Jim Carrey is cast as Fletcher Reed,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   a fast-talking attorney
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.960]   and an habitual liar.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.440]   When his son, Max,
[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.080]   blows out his candles
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.920]   on his fifth birthday cake,
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.860]   he has just one wish,
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.900]   that his dad would stop lying
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.260]   for 24 hours.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.060]   When Max's wish miraculously comes true,
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.180]   Fletcher discovers
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.240]   that his biggest asset,
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.800]   his mouth,
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.220]   has suddenly become
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.620]   his biggest liability.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.980]   My favorite scene in the film
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.480]   is where Miss Berry, his teacher,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.480]   asks the question of the kids.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.920]   "Today, we're going to talk about
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.760]   what our parents do for work."
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.560]   And the little girl says,
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.900]   "My mummy is a doctor."
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.360]   And little boy says,
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.400]   "My daddy is a truck driver."
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.240]   And Max says,
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.440]   "Well, my mum is a teacher."
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.480]   So Miss Berry says,
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.280]   "And your dad?"
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.980]   And Max says this, I kid you not,
[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.680]   "My dad, he's a liar."
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.720]   Teacher says, "A liar?
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.920]   I'm sure you don't mean that."
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.320]   And Max says, and you'll love this,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.560]   "And he," this is for you, Vincent,
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.400]   "Well, he wears a suit
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.060]   and he goes to court
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.260]   and he talks to the judge."
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.260]   And Miss Berry says,
[00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.940]   "Oh, I see.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.980]   You mean he's a lawyer."
[00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.240]   And Max shrugs his shoulders
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.880]   and says, "Yeah, whatever."
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.720]   Now, what has that got to do with our series?
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.580]   Well, as we discussed last week,
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.620]   our enemy is a habitual liar.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.820]   He cannot tell the truth for a second,
[00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.320]   let alone 24 hours.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.900]   When we did our Women in the Old Testament series
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.300]   and when we looked at the story of Rahab,
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.340]   it was about the tendency to downplay lying
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.380]   by calling it a fib, a white lie,
[00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.420]   a half-truth, a little lie.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.320]   But I said at the time, and I say it now,
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.260]   a lie is a lie.
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.200]   Now, Scripture has many names for the enemy.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.240]   One is the father of lies.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.600]   In John 8, 44, I'm gonna read it to you.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.100]   "When he lies, he speaks out of his own character,
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.140]   for he is a liar and the father of lies."
[00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.120]   Satan or the devil is known
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.420]   by a number of names in Scripture.
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.460]   And all of these names point to his evil character.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.160]   The chief characteristics we find in this creature
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.560]   are hostility, cunning, power,
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.600]   and evil intent towards God and towards his people.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   It is therefore strategic for us
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.520]   to be able to spot the enemy's lies.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.920]   Not so you can focus on the lies,
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.820]   but so you can avoid them
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.960]   and to fix your gaze back to the good shepherd.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.760]   I want you to look at this hand.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.080]   I'll put one on the screen.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.600]   And I'm gonna use these five fingers
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.660]   to help you spot them,
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.940]   to help you overcome them,
[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.840]   and to help you win the battle for your mind
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.500]   with the truth of Jesus.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.240]   And the first lie I'm gonna talk about
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.420]   is the lie of comparison,
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.820]   the lie of comparison.
[00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.820]   Now, first and foremost,
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.200]   if you're hearing that it's better at another table,
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.960]   you've allowed the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.800]   John 10:10 says this,
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.280]   "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.300]   I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:20.640]   The table that God prepares for you is about life
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.880]   and is about abundant life at that.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   Any other table than God's table
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:40.020]   is about stealing, killing, and destroying.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:47.820]   When the enemy sits at your table,
[00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.160]   he often points to another table
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.860]   and talks about it being better elsewhere.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:00.080]   How amazing is it somewhere else?
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.280]   He points to another table and says,
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.740]   "Hey, that is the solution to your problem."
[00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:14.960]   But ultimately, he is not selling you the truth.
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.460]   He's selling you lies.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.120]   He's selling you death.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:26.500]   And the tool he uses is the tool of trickery,
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.940]   the lie of comparison.
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:33.440]   He tells you there's a better table elsewhere.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.520]   It goes something like this.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:41.080]   Surely you should leave your spouse
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.060]   and hook up with somebody else.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.020]   Life would be better there, right?
[00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.760]   That's the solution to all your problems.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:57.300]   If you could just be with someone else.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.240]   Surely you should run with a other crowd
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.080]   who are far more exciting than the people from church.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.920]   Go do your own thing for a season.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.800]   That's gonna be what you want.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.300]   Surely at another table, there's more fun,
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.500]   more of what you are looking for.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   My friends, don't, don't, don't give into that.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.740]   The devil loves for you to look at your life
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.740]   and compare it with somebody else's.
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.120]   And make you wish that you had what they had.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:53.600]   The whole advertising industry is built around that.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And Satan has his cocktail shaker ready.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.180]   And he mixes a little jealousy with a dash of coveting
[00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:09.780]   and a splash of, "Woe is me."
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.780]   And as he's shaking the cocktail,
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:17.460]   he's muttering how God must love that other person
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.160]   more than he loves you.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.460]   How God is blessing that person
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.660]   more than God is blessing you.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.720]   How God is withholding from you something you need.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:33.260]   Pretty soon this barman has convinced you
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.460]   that God isn't good.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.760]   God hasn't blessed you.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.580]   God doesn't love you.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.540]   You missed out on something
[00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.980]   because God is mean and forgot about you.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.340]   Or maybe God's been lying to you all this time.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:02.080]   We have a name for this.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:06.160]   We call it the grass is always greener syndrome.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:14.220]   If your eyes are not locked on those of the good shepherd,
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.100]   then you're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:24.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:39.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:44.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:02.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:07.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:12.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:20.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:25.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:30.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:35.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:40.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:53.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:03.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.100]   You're distracted by the tyranny of comparison.
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:10.100]   Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:19.100]   My next finger represents the lie that you are doomed.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:24.100]   If you've somehow bought the lie that somehow you're not going to make it,
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.100]   the enemy is at your table.
[00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.100]   The voice tells you that life is hopeless.
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.100]   There's no way out.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.100]   Might as well chuck it in.
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:38.100]   Quit and die.
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.100]   Ever felt like that?
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.100]   Where do you get this kind of thinking?
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.100]   Where do you hear these words of gloom and doom?
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.100]   I can tell you it is not the good shepherd.
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:57.100]   It is more likely the enemy at your table.
[00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.100]   Now last week I spoke about Psalm 23 verse 4.
[00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.100]   I'll read it again.
[00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.100]   "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:15.100]   I will fear no evil, for you are with me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:23.100]   The key word in this verse is the one I've put in yellow, through.
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:28.100]   The good shepherd doesn't say you're going to the valley,
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.100]   like we're going to happy valley, right?
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.100]   You're not going to the valley.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.100]   You are going through it.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:42.100]   In other words, you are going to make it.
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:46.100]   He says this, we are going through the valley
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.100]   and I'm going to be with you all the way through.
[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.100]   And guess what?
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:56.100]   We're going to have a story to tell on the other side.
[00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:59.100]   Now I said in week one, I owned up.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:04.100]   If I had written Psalm 23 and not David,
[00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:12.100]   I would have said, you prepare a table for me in your presence
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.100]   and scatter my enemies.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.100]   Sounds much better, right?
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:23.100]   Christians often talk about the loving presence of God.
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.100]   We pray prayers, don't we? We've all done it.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.100]   Lord, we pray that you would be with us today.
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.100]   You've ever prayed that one?
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.100]   But you know what? God has already answered that prayer.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.100]   Christ lives in you.
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.100]   We may not always feel it.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.100]   And there are other times we're very aware of his presence,
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:49.100]   like in our worship times.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.100]   But I need to tell you, there is not one Bible verse
[00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.100]   in the whole of the New Testament
[00:16:56.100 --> 00:17:01.100]   that encourages us to seek or encourage the presence of God.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.100]   Why?
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.100]   Because God became visible in Jesus
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:10.100]   and now lives in us by his Holy Spirit.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.100]   Can I say that again?
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.100]   God became visible in Jesus
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:22.100]   and now lives in us by his Holy Spirit.
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:27.100]   I no longer seek the presence of Jesus.
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:30.100]   I seek the person of Jesus.
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:34.100]   I no longer seek the presence of the Spirit.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:39.100]   I seek the person of the Holy Spirit and his power.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:45.100]   I have God living in me.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.100]   And God promises he is there with us
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.100]   in the presence of our enemies.
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:56.100]   Jesus is at the table with us in the fire,
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.100]   as we just sang about,
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:02.100]   in hardship, in feelings of hopelessness,
[00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.100]   in the broken world.
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.100]   God doesn't eliminate all our difficulties.
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:12.100]   He allows us to walk through hardships
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:19.100]   and he walks through those hardships with us.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:26.100]   Have you ever believed that you're hopeless?
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.100]   You are not hopeless.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.100]   I tell you why.
[00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.100]   Jesus lives in you.
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:40.100]   Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:45.100]   My next finger represents the lie of worthlessness.
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.100]   I've got to be very careful now.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.100]   My number three finger, right?
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.100]   Represents the lie of worthlessness.
[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.100]   If you're hearing voices that say,
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.100]   "You're not good enough."
[00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.100]   Again, we briefly touched on this in week one,
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:07.100]   when we sang Lauren Daigle's song, "You Say."
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.100]   If you're hearing these voices,
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.100]   the enemy is at your table.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.100]   Now we've got to be a little bit careful with this one
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:23.100]   because Scripture, after all, calls us to be humble.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.100]   But as C.S. Lewis once said,
[00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.100]   "Humility is not thinking less of yourself,
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.100]   but thinking of yourself less."
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:40.100]   Humility is not thinking less about yourself,
[00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:45.100]   but about thinking about yourself less.
[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:51.100]   In churches, we get confused, often get confused,
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:56.100]   by thinking that we are honoring God
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:01.100]   by thinking of ourselves less.
[00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.100]   Nothing could be further from the truth.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.100]   We were made in God's image.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:13.100]   You were made in God's image.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.100]   Now, this doesn't give us an excuse
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:25.100]   to strut around and adopt a "it's all about me" attitude.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.100]   But it doesn't leave us wallowing in,
[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:33.100]   "I don't measure up afterwards."
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.100]   By the way, I've been in churches for many, many years.
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.100]   I got very, very used to babies crying in the service.
[00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.100]   So it's a very lovely thing to happen.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.100]   So don't worry about it.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.100]   The devil is equally pleased
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:54.100]   when we think too much or too little of ourselves.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.100]   And tonight, I specifically want to encourage you
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:01.100]   if you gravitate towards the latter camp.
[00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:05.100]   You just don't feel you are enough.
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:11.100]   Maybe someone told you, you'll never amount to anything.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.100]   Here's something, the "Not Enough" anthem
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:17.100]   was composed in the pit of hell.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:25.100]   It's crippling, debilitating, paralyzing, suffocating.
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.100]   It did not come from the Good Shepherd.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.100]   If you're hearing it and you're even repeating it,
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:37.100]   there must be an enemy at your table.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.100]   This lie is not a reflection of humility.
[00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.100]   It's a club that beats you over the head.
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:49.100]   It tries to convince you that you are a spiritual reject.
[00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.100]   You're a worthless sinner who will always be a worthless sinner.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:58.100]   You are not God's child.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:06.100]   Can I suggest you look across the table for a moment?
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:14.100]   You lock eyes with the one who is sitting across from you.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.100]   Do you see scorn and shame?
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:25.100]   Or do you notice the nail scars on the one who is refilling your water glass
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:30.100]   and the pitcher that is being lifted to give you a refreshing drink?
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:37.100]   Now, sure I know that's Jesus and he's the Holy One.
[00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:44.100]   But he invited you here.
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:49.100]   He booked the table.
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.100]   He prepared the meal.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:56.100]   He sat down to join you.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:06.100]   And this reservation cost him everything.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.100]   John 10, 11 says, "I am the Good Shepherd."
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:14.100]   The Good Shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:22.100]   Jesus has put it all on the line to be sitting at the table with you.
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:28.100]   Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:38.100]   My next finger represents the lie of me against the world.
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   I had lunch with somebody last week.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:45.100]   He told me he just quit his job.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:52.100]   When I asked why, he said, "Oh, everybody hated me there."
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:56.100]   As I probed a little wearing my pastor hat,
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:00.100]   I discovered this was not the first time this had happened.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.100]   A couple of years ago, he quit what seemed to be a good job
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.100]   because everybody there seemed to be against me.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:15.100]   Sadly, I also discovered he had broken up with the girl he was planning to marry.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.100]   Again, I asked what happened.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.100]   They seemed so well matched.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.100]   He said, "I blame her parents.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.100]   They never liked me from the start.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.100]   Everyone in the family hated me."
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.100]   I thought to myself, "Really?"
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.100]   When you are convinced that everyone is against you,
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.100]   you become convinced that everyone hates you.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:47.100]   Your family, everyone at church, your colleagues, your friends, your neighbours.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:55.100]   You're probably sitting there, sure that the waiter has spit in your soup.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:00.100]   If you're hearing a voice that says, "Everyone's against you."
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.100]   The enemy is sitting at your table.
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.100]   He says, "You don't trust anyone."
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.100]   You become paranoid and it is not logical.
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:18.100]   You may not exactly hear the word hate, but you may be thinking,
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:24.100]   "Ah, that person doesn't even look up at me when I walk in the office.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.100]   I bet she doesn't like me.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:31.100]   See those people talking over there.
[00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:35.100]   I guarantee they're talking about me.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:40.100]   All my friends, they do things without me.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:44.100]   Nobody ever invites me anywhere.
[00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:47.100]   Nobody likes me."
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:53.100]   What you're doing is you develop a defence mechanism
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:58.100]   and you never allow people to get too close to you.
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:07.100]   The simple truth is that you need to let the Good Shepherd lead you by the still waters.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:13.100]   You need Him to let you, cause you to lie down in green pastures.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.100]   You need to ask God to refresh your souls
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:23.100]   and guide you along the righteous path of healing and restoration.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:31.100]   You may feel surrounded by pressure and trouble,
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:37.100]   but know that God has set a table for you.
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:45.100]   And in the middle of all this, God has got your back.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:51.100]   As a minister, I'm always confronted by people trying to trip me up.
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:55.100]   I used to call it the Monday morning email.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.100]   But Sandra and I are blessed to have people all over the world
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:06.100]   who have our back and pray for us.
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.100]   Now on a Saturday evening, inevitably here at KSC,
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:14.100]   I, Chin and Sway are sitting behind us.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:19.100]   Now, they're not high profile members of this congregation,
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:26.100]   but they are here principally because they've got our back.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:32.100]   Literally and spiritually.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:37.100]   But even more importantly, God has our back.
[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.100]   When you and I remind ourselves of the truth
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:48.100]   that we are more prone to lay our side our fear and insecurities.
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:54.100]   The truth that God is for you and not against you matters greatly.
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.100]   It's not me against the world.
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.100]   You are not made to hate yourself.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:07.100]   You are made to know that you are loved.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:11.100]   Look at the table for a moment.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:15.100]   Now forget the Taobao plastic food.
[00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:20.100]   And pretend for a moment.
[00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:24.100]   There's a banquet there.
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:31.100]   But you cannot enjoy it if your fists are clenched.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.100]   You go out after dinner, go to a restaurant and clench your fist.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.100]   You can't enjoy your dinner.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.100]   Back to Psalm 23, verse 5 says,
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:45.100]   "You anoint my head with oil and my cup overflows."
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:47.100]   Now to understand this,
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:54.100]   you need to know that the biggest enemy of the sheep is not the big bad wolf.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:29:03.100]   The biggest enemy of the sheep is tiny little parasites and flies.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:09.100]   They attempt to lay their eggs in the sheep's nose.
[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:13.100]   Yuck! It's disgusting. It's gross.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.100]   They lay their eggs in the sheep nose.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:24.100]   And so the shepherd would cover the sheep's head in oil.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:33.100]   God through His Word wants to protect you from aggravation, lies and deceit.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.100]   But there's more.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.100]   Jesus wants your life to overflow.
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.100]   To reflect the bounty of the table.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.100]   Again, forget the plastic flute for just a moment.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:59.100]   Generosity is the business card of everyone who dines with Him.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.100]   You don't hoard God's blessing.
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:11.100]   And so you pass out steak dinners to everyone, even your enemies.
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.100]   I want to tell you this. You'll never forget this.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:19.100]   Generosity is impossible with closed fists.
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.100]   I'm going to say that again. I want you to remember this for the rest of your life.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:29.100]   Generosity is impossible with closed fists.
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:36.100]   You can only give with open palms.
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.100]   I want to help change your script tonight.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.100]   From everyone is against me.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.100]   Everybody hates me.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:51.100]   To God is for me. God has my back.
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.100]   The Lord Almighty is for you.
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.100]   So not everyone is against you.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:05.100]   Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:17.100]   My last finger represents the lie that there is no way out.
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:24.100]   If you feel like you're surrounded and there is no way out, the enemy is at your table.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:31.100]   Now why I've left this one to the last one is it is the classic lie of the enemy.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:38.100]   It's the ultimate that combines several of the lies I've addressed in this sermon.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.100]   The enemy convinces you there is nowhere to turn.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.100]   Nowhere to run.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.100]   No way forward.
[00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:56.100]   No chance you are ever going to live again.
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:03.100]   One of the hardest parts of a pastor's job I have is conducting funerals.
[00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:13.100]   But I have to say the hardest part of the hardest part is suicide.
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:20.100]   Among those for me in the last couple of years have been a young lady, a committed Christian,
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:29.100]   jumping from a 46th floor after online abuse from a former boyfriend.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:44.100]   And a businessman whose luxury hotels he had built in Italy fell victim to a financial crash because of COVID.
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:57.100]   I'm not here tonight to give you glib answers because these and situations that you may have been going through are real.
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:08.100]   But if you feel like you are surrounded, I've got some good news for you.
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   You are surrounded.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.100]   But it's better than you think.
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:29.100]   As I move towards the close of this sermon, I want to draw on some more recent Christian songs for illustration.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.100]   Michael W. Smith in his song "Surrounded" says this.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:43.100]   This is how I fight my battles. Just when you think you're lost, it may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by you.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:53.100]   Hey, it may look like I'm surrounded, but I'm surrounded by you.
[00:33:53.100 --> 00:34:03.100]   And this song draws us to the story of Elisha and the God of angel armies.
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.100]   Another song.
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:09.100]   We read in 2 Kings 6.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:18.100]   The God's prophet Elisha found himself in this situation after giving valuable advice to Israel's army.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:27.100]   The king of Syria decided to take Elisha as a prisoner and he sent an army to the city where the prophet was staying.
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:35.100]   Under the cover of darkness, the Syrian warriors surrounded the city.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:41.100]   When Elisha's servant woke early in the morning to begin his usual routine,
[00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:48.100]   he found himself looking out at an army of Syrians.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:54.100]   He cried out to his master in panic. "What shall we do?"
[00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:58.100]   For the prophet Elisha, the choice was clear.
[00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:03.100]   And his answer to the servant was simple and full of faith.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:15.100]   He said this, "Don't be afraid for those who are with us are more than those who are against us."
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:22.100]   This would have been really difficult for the servant to accept as he looked out and he looked at a wall of enemies
[00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:26.100]   bristling with spears and shields.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:35.100]   The servant didn't see anybody ready and willing to fight on their side.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:40.100]   But Elisha saw it in a completely different situation.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:44.100]   He spoke to the Lord on behalf of his servant and we read this.
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:54.100]   That Elisha prayed and said, "Oh Lord, please open his eyes that he might see."
[00:35:54.100 --> 00:36:03.100]   Suddenly the servant was able to see with the same enlightened eyes as Elisha.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:07.100]   The hills around the city weren't empty at all.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:15.100]   A mighty host of horses and chariots of fire stood in wait,
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:19.100]   sent by the Lord to protect his prophet.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.100]   We read this, "So the Lord opened the eyes of the young man
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:33.100]   and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha."
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:42.100]   The Syrians began to advance on the city, unaware that they were now vastly outnumbered.
[00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:51.100]   Elisha spoke to God again asking, "Strike this people I pray with blindness."
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:58.100]   Chaos broke out in the Syrian ranks as the entire army suddenly went blind.
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:10.100]   My friends, in a matter of moments, Elisha's simple faith reduced a seemingly unstoppable foe to nothing.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:17.100]   Now this story was the inspiration behind Chris Tomlin's song, "God of Angel Armies."
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.100]   The chorus goes like this, we've sung it here before.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.100]   I know who goes before me.
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:26.100]   I know who stands behind.
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:34.100]   The God of angel armies is always by my side.
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:40.100]   The same is true for you and for me.
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.100]   Now it may be true that circumstances are closing.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:51.100]   Your whole world is surrounded by threats, accusations, missiles.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.100]   The enemy says you're doomed.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:59.100]   There's no way out.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:11.100]   But I tell you that God has everyone and everything surrounding you, surrounded.
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:22.100]   Don't give the enemy a seat at your table.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.100]   There's another in the fire.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:29.100]   We're going to finish now and ask the band to return.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:37.100]   And my inspiration actually comes from another song.
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:46.100]   Two years ago, I was in Brisbane, Australia for the funeral of a close friend.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:51.100]   It was actually my son's father-in-law.
[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:58.100]   Somebody I'd known and loved for over 30 years.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:05.100]   On the Friday night, the day before the funeral, I visited Hillsong Church in Brisbane
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:10.100]   and heard this song, the one that we sang earlier for the very first time.
[00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:15.100]   It was written by a young man called Chris Davenport,
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:22.100]   whose son had been recently diagnosed with autism.
[00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:32.100]   It comes from the story of Meshach, Shadrach and Abednego in the book of Daniel.
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:37.100]   To put things briefly, all people, including these three men,
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:43.100]   under the jurisdiction of King Nebuchadnezzar, were ordered to worship an idol
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:49.100]   or face the penalty of being hurled into a furnace.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:54.100]   Due to their faith, Shadrach and Co. refused.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:58.100]   Of course, they weren't desiring to be burnt alive.
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:08.100]   But under the faith that if God so wills, he will save them from such a terrible fate.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:13.100]   Ultimately, the men were indeed cast into the fire.
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:19.100]   But instead of three of them, we see the picture in the furnace.
[00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:23.100]   There appeared four men.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:29.100]   The fourth being either an angel or, some people believe, Jesus.
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:38.100]   The long and the short of this story is that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:52.100]   came out of the furnace unscathed, not even a burn mark on them.
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:41:00.100]   May this be our testimony.
[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:06.100]   I invite you to stand.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:12.100]   I just want to read this chorus to you and then we're going to sing it now.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.100]   There's another in the fire, standing next to me.
[00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:20.100]   There's another in the waters, holding back the sea.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:25.100]   And should I ever need reminding what power set me free,
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:30.100]   there is a grave that holds no body.
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:37.100]   Now that power lives in me.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:49.100]   Now that power lives in you, my friends.
[00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:58.100]   When the enemy tries to spin lies, when he tries to sit at your table,
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:07.100]   there is one who is there with you and he will take you through this.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:16.100]   So as we sing this, may you sing this in an act of faith,
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:22.100]   as a testimony to the one who is in the fire with us.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.100]   Let's sing together.
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:35.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
