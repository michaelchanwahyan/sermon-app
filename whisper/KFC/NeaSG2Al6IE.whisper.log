[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.240]   Today we reach week 4 of our Emotionally Healthy series.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.180]   This is not just a new series.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.240]   We are implementing a new culture.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.500]   You see, our spiritual health, our relationship with Jesus is tied to our emotional health.
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.600]   You cannot separate these two things.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.120]   Jesus didn't and neither can we.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.760]   Three weeks ago James got us started.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.820]   He set the scene as it were.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.500]   Two weeks ago I asked the question "Why?" as I talked about going beneath the surface
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.280]   and asking why we do the things that we do.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.580]   Last week Michelle talked about breaking the power of the past.
[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.240]   I want to honor her for her openness.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:10.160]   Tonight I'm talking about the Emotionally Healthy trait of living in brokenness and
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.040]   vulnerability.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.360]   We all know that if I want to have meaningful relationships I need to be broken.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.200]   I need to be vulnerable.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.440]   But we don't do it.
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:40.900]   And the main reason is we don't actually know.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:49.480]   If we turn to Genesis 37 which Bonnie read to us, we come across a man called Jacob.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.000]   Now you know what Jacob's other name was don't you?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.100]   Yes, it was Israel.
[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.440]   And you know how many sons he had?
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.680]   Yes, twelve.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.200]   Who became the twelve tribes of Israel.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.920]   And we come across this character Joseph.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.080]   And Joseph was his daddy's favorite.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.200]   I'm always amazed when people who know I've got two sons ask me "Which one is your favorite
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   son?"
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.400]   Or when they find out I've got five grandchildren, say "Which one is your favorite grandchild?"
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.600]   Make no mistake, favoritism is a sin.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.400]   And here it is generational.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.080]   We saw it with Abraham and it was handed down through Isaac.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.080]   Generational sin.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.320]   And Jacob made it very clear who his favorite was.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.880]   He brought him the coat of many colors.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.760]   It made the other eleven mad.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.140]   Right really mad.
[00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.240]   So mad they wanted to kill Joseph.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:09.240]   They were about to kill him when one especially creative brother, he got an idea.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.440]   This brother's name is Judah.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.440]   Let's read this.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:22.360]   "Then Judah said to his brothers, 'What profit is it if we kill our brother and conceal his
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.360]   blood?
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:32.000]   Come, let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.680]   brother, our own flesh.'
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.460]   And his brothers listened to him."
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.240]   Now this is sibling rivalry in its extreme form.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.720]   Crazy.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.320]   About to kill him.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.760]   Judah's idea says, "Hey bros, we can make a little bit of money from this situation."
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.160]   Now notice he couches it in a nicety quote.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.800]   He's our own brother, our own flesh and blood.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.280]   But Joseph is sold and you know the story.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:19.480]   And as such it becomes a sort of parallel to Judah's story that we're going to see tonight.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.480]   We're going to look at Judah's story in Genesis 38.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.680]   Now Genesis 38 surely fits into the category of spiritual oddities.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.640]   I've rarely, if at all, heard it preached in church.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:45.320]   Now notice how it is planted right in the middle of Joseph's story.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.320]   Verse 1.
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.800]   "It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and turned aside to
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.760]   a certain Adolamite whose name was Hira.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:08.340]   In the midst of his father's grief, in the midst of family turmoil, Judah goes AWOL."
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.200]   You might say we do the same.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.920]   Get away from my deadbeat dad, etc.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.900]   But you'd be missing something.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.200]   See where Jacob and his sons lived was a place called Canaan.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.880]   Canaan was of course the promised land.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.480]   Abraham was called into it.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:35.360]   So Judah is not only leaving his grieving father and his distraught family, he is leaving
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.640]   the promised land.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.480]   The place where one day Messiah would come through.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.480]   Let's read on.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:49.460]   "There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shuwa.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:06:00.120]   He took her and went into her, and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Ur."
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:10.600]   So Judah goes from the promised land, he leaves his family, and marries a Canaanite woman.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.160]   Judah probably in defiance of his father's wishes is said to marry a Canaanite girl instead
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.640]   of someone closer to his own kith and kin.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.720]   Remember God had said don't marry outside the family of Israel or they will turn you
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.840]   away to their own gods.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   They had three sons, the oldest of whom eventually marries a girl named Tamar.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:47.120]   This man dies soon after without having a son, an heir, born to him.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.640]   So as was the custom of the day to ensure the succession of the family line, Judah makes
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.120]   his second son marry Tamar.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:07.860]   But before long he dies too, having refused to even try to have a baby with Tamar.
[00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.680]   We move on to verse 11.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:19.280]   "Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, 'Remain a widow in your father's house, till
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:28.120]   Shelah my son grows up, for he feared that he would die like his brothers.'
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:34.560]   So Tamar went and remained in her father's house."
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:41.040]   By now Judah is starting to think that Tamar is nothing short of bad luck.
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:48.640]   So even though he promises to give Tamar in marriage to his last and his youngest son,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.620]   secretly Judah intends to do no such thing.
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.960]   So what if Tamar is remained a bereft and childless widow the rest of her days?
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.160]   This girl is a husband killer.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.720]   She is jinxed.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:11.120]   So he wasn't about to let her wipe out also his final child.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.560]   Now this is so offensive.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.600]   He is disowning her.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:23.440]   The law said it was the father-in-law's responsibility to take his widow daughter-in-law into his
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.680]   family and care for her like a daughter.
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.400]   And things are about to get worse, much worse.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   Let's read on.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   Verse 12.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:44.640]   "In the course of time, the wife of Judah, Shewa's daughter, died.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:52.680]   When Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah, to his sheep shearers, he and his friend Hira
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.020]   the Adalamite."
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.280]   So what we have here, his wife dies.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.840]   He is grieving his wife.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.280]   He goes to a sheep shearing party.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:12.040]   I guess the modern day equivalent of this would be a rave, a party, an orgy.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.480]   Judah numbs his pain with drunkenness.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.920]   Let's read on.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:24.000]   "When Tamar was told, 'Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,'
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.540]   she took off her widow's garment and covered herself with a veil, wrapping herself up,
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:36.800]   and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:43.880]   For she saw that Shewa had grown up and she had not been given to him in marriage.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:50.840]   When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:56.360]   He turned to her at the roadside and said, 'Come, let me come into you.'
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.480]   For he did not know she was his daughter-in-law.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:08.360]   She said to him, 'What will you give me that you might come into me?'"
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   Tamar's plan was to become pregnant by this ruse so that she might bear a child in Judah's
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:25.120]   line, since Judah had not kept his promise to give her to his son Shelah, who was by
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.800]   now grown up.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   Let's read on.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.800]   Verse 18.
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.880]   "He said, 'What pledge shall I give you?'
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:40.400]   She replied, 'Your signet and your cord and your staff that is in your hand.'
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:47.960]   So he gave them to her and went into her, and she conceived by him.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.280]   Then she arose and went away.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.440]   Taking off her veil, she put on the garments of her widowhood."
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:03.840]   Judah gave her the things that make him him.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:09.480]   I guess in Hong Kong it's like giving your Hong Kong ID card or your driving license,
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.080]   the things that made him a patriarch.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:19.200]   He trades them for sex.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:25.960]   He thought he was sleeping with a shrine prostitute.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.940]   That was very much the ancient worship practice.
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:35.120]   The temples, the shrines had their own prostitutes.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.560]   Let's read on.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.440]   "When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adalamite to take back the pledge from
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.760]   the woman's hand, he did not find her.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:53.080]   And he asked the men of the place, 'Where is the cult prostitute who was at Enahim at
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.200]   the roadside?'
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:01.520]   And they said, 'No cult prostitute had been here.'"
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:07.080]   Jacob clearly had no regard for Yahweh, for God.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.320]   And it gets worse.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:16.120]   You'll see from the verse on your screen, a few months later, when her belly began to
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:26.000]   bulge a bit, "A servant noticed this and so informed Judah, 'Tamar is with child.'"
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.960]   At last, Judah saw the opening he had maybe been looking for.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:42.200]   In one foul swoop, he could get rid of this bad luck woman, free his youngest son to marry
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:47.880]   someone else, and just be done with the whole thing.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:57.040]   The best part is that since Tamar was clearly guilty of adultery and/or fornication, putting
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.280]   her to death was fully allowed by the law.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:09.240]   So he could get rid of this problem and not get into trouble for doing so at the same
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.000]   time.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.520]   The sort of guy Judah is burns women.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:23.560]   The book of Leviticus said the punishment was to stone them.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.200]   This guy was about to go one stage further.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.280]   Judah is a self-righteous hypocrite.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.480]   Judah is a liar.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.160]   Judah is a betrayer.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:43.000]   Judah is a snake with no regard for God.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.640]   A drunk, a pervert, profane, the sort of person who burns women.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:14:01.000]   In that moment, she is unmarried, pregnant, and he is declaring his righteousness.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.240]   He is proud.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.640]   He is pompous.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:16.880]   All of a sudden, the story takes a catastrophic turn.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.360]   Let's read it.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:27.720]   Verse 25, "As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, 'By the man
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.120]   to whom these belong, I am pregnant.'
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:45.400]   And she said, 'Please identify who these are, the signet, the cord, and the star.'"
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.760]   What a bummer.
[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.880]   The whole town has turned out to try this woman.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.360]   Nobody could have scripted this.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.280]   Judah is utterly exposed.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:11.720]   We'll come back to Judah, but this leads me nicely into tonight's topic of brokenness
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.680]   and vulnerability.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:22.520]   Pete Siqueiros on his broken, emotionally healthy series, his group of books, says this,
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:30.080]   "In emotionally healthy churches, people live and lead out of brokenness and vulnerability.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:37.960]   They understand their leadership in the kingdom of God is from the bottom up and not a grasping,
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.840]   controlling, or lording it over others.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:49.080]   It is leading out of failure and pain, questions and struggles."
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:56.460]   This is what an emotionally healthy church looks like.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:16:03.800]   But the question for us is, what does brokenness look like?
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:10.480]   Well, Judah gives us a very good look at what brokenness looks like.
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.320]   I've got this definition.
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:21.920]   Brokenness comes from a sin that happens to us, the sin that happens around us, and the
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.880]   sin that happens through us.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.480]   Sin that we don't have control over.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:37.200]   For example, the person who's watching this online and straight away after the service
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.600]   is over will get back to watching porn.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:47.040]   Somebody who has an emotional attachment to maybe a male or female in the office and it's
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.640]   very unhealthy.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.840]   There are other things as well.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:58.200]   People who've been abused, people who are angry.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:07.440]   Church is made up more of people who would try to control their brokenness than to reveal
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440]   it.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:16.520]   And my experience is that there are one of three reactions to brokenness in a church.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.400]   We're going to look at them now.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   The first one is to flee.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:28.200]   Judah's example of dealing with his wife's death was to go to a sheep shearing party
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:32.520]   and mask it with numbing pain.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:38.320]   When Hong Kong life sucks and things don't go your way, we go to the latest restaurant
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:46.500]   if we can, or we hide it with booze, shopping, spending.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.280]   The second one is to fight.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.880]   We live a bitter and angry life.
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.380]   We pick an issue.
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:03.080]   We believe our anger is righteous indignation.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.120]   And the third one is we hide.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:12.480]   We think we can cover up, put our best out and hide up the unsightly parts of our life.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.800]   All our social media is based on this.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:20.560]   There are bits of my life that I want you to see.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:26.040]   This is what Judah does.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:37.000]   But the thing about Judah, he flees, he fights, he hides.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:45.440]   Is that things end up going rather well for him.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:51.200]   After the story, things go well for Judah.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.760]   This is probably going to make you mad.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:02.680]   But Judah, the muttonhead, gets blessed.
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:09.560]   At the end of his father's life, at the end of Jacob's life, he calls his sons together
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.480]   and he speaks words over them.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.520]   Words about their life and legacy and what their life is going to look like.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.880]   A blessing.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:26.800]   And we see amazingly that nobody gets a blessing like Judah.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.440]   A glowing blessing about his legacy and future.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.160]   Here's what he says in Genesis 49.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.440]   You won't believe this.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.800]   Judah, your brothers shall praise you.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.080]   Your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.000]   Your father's son shall bow down before you.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Judah is a lion's cub from the prey, my son, you have gone up.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.940]   He stooped down.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:58.320]   He crouched as a lion and as a lioness who dares rouse him.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:05.000]   The scepter shall not depart from Judah nor the ruler's staff from beneath his feet until
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.760]   tribute comes to him.
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.360]   And to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.480]   Binding his foal to the vine and his donkey's colt to the choice vine, he has washed his
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:24.280]   garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:32.840]   His eyes are darker than wine and his teeth whiter than milk.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:40.640]   This is the blessing that Judah receives.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.640]   Is it fair?
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.800]   I mean, take Joseph.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   There is no record whatsoever of Joseph sinning his life.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.320]   He saves his people.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:58.160]   When confronted with Polypha's wife who wants to sleep with him, he flees because he trusts
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.840]   God.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:10.600]   And yet Judah, who has sex with his daughter-in-law, believing she is a prostitute, gets that kind
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.560]   of blessing.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:22.520]   Is it fair to bless a snake like Judah rather than, say, a righteous person like Joseph?
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.400]   Look again at verse 10.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.960]   I want to see its significance.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.820]   You probably missed it the first time.
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:36.600]   The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from beneath his feet, until
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:43.640]   tribute comes to him, and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:49.960]   My friends, this verse refers to Messiah.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:56.120]   It is a messianic prophecy.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:06.300]   Through your line, Judah, this is where the Messiah is going to come through.
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.980]   In Matthew 1 we see a genealogy.
[00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:17.300]   It connects the dots between Abraham and Jesus.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.980]   And look at these verses.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:28.380]   Where is his lineage?
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.380]   Judah.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.380]   Yuck.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.380]   Gross.
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.060]   Hold on.
[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:46.220]   Let's go back to the time that Judah is exposed.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.500]   Tamar is pregnant and unmarried.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:59.580]   Judah is the prime accuser until he is found out.
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.460]   But he doesn't flee.
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.160]   He doesn't fight.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.540]   He doesn't hide.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:12.860]   He gets real.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.860]   Let's read.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:22.900]   And she, that is Tamar, said, "Please identify whose these are, the signet, the cord, and
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.060]   the staff."
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:34.500]   Then Judah identified them and said, "She is more righteous than I, since I did not
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.580]   give her to my son, Shelah."
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:51.580]   He exposes his wickedness and says, "I'm the one who deserves the punishment."
[00:23:51.580 --> 00:24:00.780]   And he proceeds to get himself right before God to such an extent that we see after Genesis
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:07.500]   38, the 12 sons often referred to as Judah and his brothers.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.660]   Let me give you an example.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.020]   Genesis 44, 14.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:17.140]   When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, he was still there.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.620]   They fell before him to the ground.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:29.580]   Now the author of Genesis is trying to tell us that Judah has changed.
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:32.260]   Why?
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.860]   How?
[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:41.700]   He got honest with who he was and he changed as a result.
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:49.340]   In Genesis 44, he promises to his father to take the blame if anything happens to his
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.780]   youngest son, Benjamin.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.140]   He even pledges his life.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.460]   You know the story, don't you?
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:01.500]   Joseph rises to a position of power in Egypt.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:09.300]   Twenty years after being betrayed, he meets his brothers again without recognizing them.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:16.140]   The youngest brother, Benjamin, had remained in Canaan with Jacob.
[00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:26.300]   So Joseph takes Simeon hostage and insists that the brothers return with Benjamin.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:35.340]   Jacob instead offers himself to Jacob as security for Benjamin's safety and manages to persuade
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:40.820]   Jacob to let him take Benjamin to Egypt.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:49.860]   When the brothers return, Joseph tests them by demanding the enslavement of Benjamin.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:56.980]   We see Judah pleading for Benjamin's life.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:04.420]   And this is where we see Joseph revealing his true identity.
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:15.820]   Judah had made a 180 degrees turnaround from selling his brother Joseph into slavery.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:20.020]   That's how much he had changed.
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:26.740]   And he says, "Let the hurt be on me."
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.740]   But why?
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.820]   Why did Judah get the blessing?
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:36.700]   Because Judah is acting like Christ.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:42.500]   The blame due to someone else, he took on himself.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.300]   Let the hurt be on me.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.980]   Who does that remind you of?
[00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.020]   Yes, Christ.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:56.900]   Jesus substituting for us, taking the punishment that was due to us.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:03.020]   And Judah becomes an example for us.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.500]   So what do we learn from Judah?
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.180]   Two things.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:14.780]   Firstly, brokenness kept inside destroys us.
[00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:21.100]   When you keep your sin a secret, it suffocates you.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:25.620]   Judah believed he was worthless and he lived his life on that premise.
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:31.140]   He got angry because he believed his father didn't love him.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:36.060]   Behind anger, we often find hurt.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:46.140]   What holds us in brokenness so often is our shame and it dictates our way of life.
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:47.900]   I'm worthless.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.020]   I crave affirmation.
[00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.020]   I'm dumb.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.220]   I'm not intelligent.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.540]   So I hold my opinion back.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.540]   I'm bad.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.620]   I'm trouble.
[00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:00.140]   So we keep our brokenness.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.580]   We keep our sins from our friends and from God.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:11.020]   David in Psalm 32 said, "When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away through
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:15.900]   my groaning all day long."
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:22.820]   When you get vulnerable, you get to be you.
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.260]   When you get honest, you get to be you.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:35.020]   Your dreams are on the table and there you'll be known for who you really are.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:44.820]   Our job here at KFCI is to create a safe space for others to be real.
[00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:50.660]   A place for the Judah's.
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:59.060]   Now if brokenness kept inside destroys us, the second point is this.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.860]   Grace empowers us.
[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:06.980]   The gospel is not legalism.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.680]   It doesn't say you shape up or else.
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.520]   The gospel is humble yourself.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.740]   The gospel is be honest.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:24.580]   Yes, the Bible does say the wages of sin are death, but in the same breath, it tells us
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:33.500]   that you are loved so much by God that his son would pay those wages.
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.220]   You see what that does for you.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:41.700]   It gives you a proper perspective of your self-worth.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:47.180]   I found this wonderful quote from the book by Francis Spufford called Unapologetic.
[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.740]   I want to read it to you.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:54.700]   If you won't hear the bad news about yourself, you can't know yourself.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:30:00.540]   You condemn yourself to the maintenance of an exhausting illusion, a false front about
[00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:08.060]   yourself which keeps out doubt and with it hope, change, nourishment, breath, life.
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:17.860]   If you won't hear the bad news, you can't begin to hear the good news about yourself.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:30.500]   Jesus is actually looking for people like Judah because they need him.
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:41.980]   Have you been honest to realize today that you still need him?
[00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.220]   Be honest with God.
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.700]   Tell him everything.
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.740]   That's where grace steps in.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:57.460]   I think many of you know the story of Amazing Grace and John Newton.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.740]   John Newton was a slave trader.
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:10.180]   In 1748 during his return voyage to England aboard the ship Greyhound, Newton had a spiritual
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.140]   conversion.
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:20.260]   From that point on, he avoided profanity, gambling and drinking.
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:31.420]   Although he continued to work in the slave trade for some time, eventually he gave up
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:36.980]   being a slave trader and he became a priest in the Anglican Church.
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:45.380]   He wrote around 250 hymns including Amazing Grace.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:32:00.500]   He said "I once was blind but the process took some time as it does for you and I."
[00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:10.260]   And here's the thing, when you get honest about your brokenness and you say "I want
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:16.540]   to give up binge drinking, gambling, porn, whatever."
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:24.020]   If you give God an inch, he will take a mile.
[00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:33.780]   Give him just a bit of your brokenness and you will find out just how amazing grace is.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:39.560]   What God did for Judah, he'll do for you and me.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:46.020]   You can hardly call Judah or Tamar biblical role models.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:51.980]   No one would look to either figure in order to determine the best way to combat one's
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:52.980]   life.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:59.940]   But precisely in their weakness, in their proneness to sin, in the mistakes that each
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:08.320]   makes and in the sin into which both fall, somehow in and through all of that, we can
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:13.480]   maybe identify with these two just a little bit.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:19.340]   And although we don't want to imitate them, I'm not saying that, we may recognize that
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:23.300]   even so, sometimes we are like them anyway.
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.640]   We too make mistakes.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:32.220]   We too sometimes find ourselves doing or saying things that place us on the opposite side
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.380]   of God's desires.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:43.940]   And sometimes we too may discover that God accomplished something good in our lives despite
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:53.640]   how undeserving we are, despite how badly we messed things up.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:34:00.980]   In any event, we know how much we need grace.
[00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:14.500]   My friends, this is a funny little story, but if it can marvel us to see grace, to marvel
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:28.020]   afresh at the wonder of grace, then it yielded some very good things after all.
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.620]   I want to encourage you.
[00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:42.400]   I'm going to pray for you now to show grace to yourselves and to use that measure to show
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.380]   grace to others.
[00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:54.740]   As the band comes up, may we pray.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:35:02.940]   Father God, yeah, we don't want to live a life that is like Judah or Tamar.
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.340]   We don't see them as role models.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:12.440]   But Lord, what we do see through their lives is your amazing grace.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:19.260]   I pray that today, Lord, we will open our hands and receive that amazing grace.
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.500]   We will be prepared to be broken, to be vulnerable.
[00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:30.420]   And Lord, I pray that you would help us to show grace to ourselves and to show that same
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.860]   grace to others.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.980]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:36.980]   Amen.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:36.980]   Amen.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.980]   Amen.
