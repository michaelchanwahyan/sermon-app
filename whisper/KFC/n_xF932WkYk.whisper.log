[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.400]   It's so good to be here tonight, and thank you, Pastor John, who's watching online from
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.400]   the UK.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400]   We miss you.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.820]   We can't wait to see you soon.
[00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.320]   But it's so good to be here tonight.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.960]   I've been part of the KFCI family officially for about six months, but we're all part of
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.680]   the family of God, so we've been family a long, long time.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.960]   Wouldn't you agree?
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.720]   I'm often asked how I ended up in Hong Kong, and behind me you see my beautiful family,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.120]   my parents.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.280]   My brother is right beside me.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.120]   Beside him is my nephew, my brother-in-law, my sister, and my niece, Hope, on the end.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.860]   She's the jewel of our family.
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.580]   But I'm often asked how I got here.
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.560]   How did I leave this beautiful group of people and end up here?
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.160]   Well, there's a long answer and a very, very short answer.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.720]   We're going to go with option number two tonight, because number one could be like a whole sermon
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.720]   in itself.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.480]   So I'll give you the short version, kind of my origin story, if you will.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.840]   When I was a little girl, probably less than five years old at that time, there was just
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.840]   me and my sister.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.800]   My dad was a young pastor starting out in the ministry.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.120]   He had seen pastors lose their children.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.840]   He had seen pastors pour out their entire lives winning other people to the gospel,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.200]   and their own children rebel and walk away from God.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.320]   And he could not bear the thought of losing his two little daughters.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.280]   It was more than he could bear.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720]   So he began to pray, and prayed this prayer later when my brother came along.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.800]   And his simple prayer was, "God, give me my children.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.480]   God, I don't have to be a famous pastor.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.520]   I don't have to pastor big, big churches.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.920]   I just want my children to grow up and know you and accept you for their own."
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.920]   Then he got even a little more bold in his prayer.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.920]   And he said, "Lord, it would be okay with me if my children live on the other side of
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.840]   the world far away from me, if they know you and they're serving you.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.040]   I would rather have them on the other side of the world than live next door to me and
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.720]   rebel against you and go to hell."
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.760]   So fast forward 30 plus years.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.240]   My sister grew up to be a worship leader.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.120]   And oh, little caveat, we never knew dad prayed that prayer.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.200]   He didn't pray that prayer in front of us.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.080]   That was his personal private plea with the Lord.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.120]   So we didn't know it was a setup.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.760]   My sister grew up to be a worship leader.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.280]   My brother grew up to be a pastor.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.520]   And me, here I am.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.240]   When I came to my dad in my mid-30s and said, "I believe God's leading me to move to Hong
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.360]   Kong and to serve him there," part of his heart went, "Ugh, because I'm a daddy's girl.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.680]   I'm still a daddy's girl.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.120]   You're never too old to be a daddy's girl."
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.040]   And when I came to him and said, "God's called me to move to the other side of the world,"
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.320]   the Lord brought back to his remembrance the prayer that he had prayed when I was very
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.320]   little.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.000]   And God asked him, "Did you really mean it?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.880]   Did you really mean it when you prayed that?"
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.360]   Dad said, "Yes, I did."
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.720]   Then God said, "You have to bless her and let her go."
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.080]   So dad was obedient and blessed me and let me go.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.760]   So since 2007, I've had the great privilege of serving the Lord here and based out of
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.320]   Hong Kong, but doing ministry all over Southeast Asia.
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.120]   And one of the passions of my heart is reaching people with the gospel and then equipping
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.320]   them to go to places that I can't go, because I can't go everywhere.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.960]   I'm one person.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.400]   You can't go everywhere.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.880]   You're one person.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.320]   But we can reach people who can go places we cannot.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.440]   So tonight we're going to look at this topic of partnership with God.
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.200]   And that seems like such a high and lofty thing, especially when we think of it in the
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.280]   context of missions.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.540]   We started a series recently in 1 Corinthians, and our first two scriptures tonight come
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.160]   out of 1 Corinthians.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.560]   1 Corinthians 1.9 in the CEV says it like this, "God can be trusted, and he chose you
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.040]   to be partners with his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.480]   1 Corinthians 3.9 says, "For we are God's fellow workers.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.820]   You are God's field, God's building."
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.360]   We have been chosen to partner with God.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.000]   But partnership or working with God didn't start in the New Testament.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.040]   That's just not a New Testament thing.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.060]   This was always God's plan.
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.880]   His desire was always from Genesis all the way to Revelation and continuing today.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.100]   His plan and desire has always been to partner with us.
[00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.360]   In the book of Genesis, of course, from the very beginning, we have the account of creation.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.640]   Day by day, God created the world.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.400]   Out of nothing, he created everything.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:26.300]   Land, ocean, water, river, streams, night, day, sun, moon, stars, animals that roam the
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.740]   earth, the fish in the sea, the birds in the air, God created it all.
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.440]   But the pinnacle of his creation was man.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.980]   Man was made in God's very own image, and man is the only thing created that God blew
[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.380]   his own breath into.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.100]   God gave man a job.
[00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.780]   Genesis 2.15 says it like this, "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.500]   of Eden to work it and take care of it."
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.580]   Now I have to wonder here, God just created the world.
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.980]   Was he not powerful enough to sustain the garden by himself?
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:10.180]   Did he really need somebody pulling the weeds?
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.260]   Did he really need somebody making sure it was nice and tidy?
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.340]   Of course not.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.140]   Of course not.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.440]   God had created it.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.900]   He was powerful enough to sustain it on his own, but he chose to partner with man.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.180]   He chose to work with Adam.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.940]   He gave Adam a second job that we see recorded in verse 19 of the same chapter.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.540]   "The Lord God formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:40.620]   sky.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.680]   He brought them to the man to see what he would name them.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.100]   And whatever the man named each living creature, that was its name."
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.300]   Now I have a bit of a crazy imagination at times, so my mind kind of goes some places
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.180]   and I wonder things like, "How long did this take to name all the animals?"
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.980]   We're not talking about a zoo with like maybe a hundred.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:13.540]   We're talking every single animal on the planet, one by one, God brought them to Adam.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:19.140]   Adam goes, "Cat, dog, giraffe.
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.140]   No, wait.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.140]   No, no, no, no.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.140]   Horse.
[00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.140]   This one is horse.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.140]   This one is giraffe.
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.220]   Like, how long did this take?
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.020]   Were there any that he said, "Falcon?
[00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.340]   No, no, no.
[00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.340]   Eagle.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.340]   You're eagle.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.340]   You're falcon."
[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.980]   I have a crazy imagination.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.220]   But the point is, Adam and God worked together on this.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:45.140]   And I wonder again, did God really need Adam to do this?
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.180]   Had he run out of creative ideas?
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.240]   I mean, he's just created the world.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.640]   He created all the animals.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.700]   Did he really need Adam to do this job?
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.420]   Of course not.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.420]   But he chose to partner with Adam.
[00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.880]   He chose to partner with man.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:08.060]   Now this partnership, this pattern of partnership or co-working with God continues throughout
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:09.460]   Scripture.
[00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.420]   We see it from cover to cover.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.740]   We see God giving Moses the task of speaking to Pharaoh.
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:22.900]   We see God, through the prophet, instructing the widow to gather empty jars of oil, empty
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.060]   oil jars so that he could fill them with oil.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.620]   In the New Testament, we see Jesus giving instruction for empty jugs to be filled with
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.620]   water.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:36.300]   We see Jesus using the little boy's lunch to feed the multitude.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.700]   There are so many more examples contained in this book.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.180]   Now don't get nervous.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.800]   We're not going to go through them all tonight.
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.700]   Not going to do that.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.900]   But the pattern is there.
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:56.820]   So what does partnership with God look like when it comes to missions?
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.060]   What does that look like?
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.820]   We partner through prayer.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.460]   That's one of the primary ways we partner with missions.
[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:13.180]   Jesus said in Matthew chapter 9, 37 through 38, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.900]   are few.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.260]   Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into the harvest field."
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.520]   A clear call to prayer.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.260]   It doesn't get much clearer than that.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:34.180]   Now let me ask, if the harvest was plentiful in Jesus' day, if the workers were few in
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:43.220]   Jesus' day, how much more plentiful is the harvest today in 2022?
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.360]   The population of the world is exploding.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.340]   It continues to increase.
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:56.260]   Current figures place the population of the world at about 7.8 billion people.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:02.020]   7.8 billion people are on this planet.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.460]   That's a number that's hard for us to comprehend, and the number keeps growing.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.060]   It keeps growing.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.060]   But here's the staggering part of the number.
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:20.860]   Two-thirds of the population of the world, approximately 5.2 billion, make no profession
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:24.180]   of faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:34.060]   Two-thirds of the population of the world make no profession of faith in Christ.
[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.980]   That's staggering, and that makes me sad, but it also motivates me.
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.820]   It drives me to say, "They have to know."
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:50.440]   If ever we intend to reach the harvest, we must pray for workers.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:59.160]   We must pray for people to reach two-thirds of the population of the planet.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:02.480]   We partner in missions through giving.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.900]   We just heard the beautiful testimony of sons and daughters, and we see the very clear need
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.820]   for princess and those like her.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.620]   It costs money to go back home.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.700]   It costs money to run a drop-in center.
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:23.700]   It's practical, it's not exciting to talk about money, but it's necessary.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.660]   It takes money to pay the lease.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.060]   We have to pay a lease on our own home.
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.140]   Leases have to be paid for services like this.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.220]   We partner by giving, giving of our finances.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:41.780]   So I encourage you, I echo Pastor James, go see the booth right out here, buy some pretty
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.780]   candles.
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.780]   Christmas is coming.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.620]   Do your Christmas shopping.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.460]   Christmas shopping and supporting missions, win-win.
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.740]   You can be early.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.920]   Go down the hall and see the other exhibits as well.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:12:01.420]   Missions takes money, and we've been so, so blessed that we can give and we can partner
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.980]   in missions.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:08.540]   But one of the biggest ways that we partner in missions is through going.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.580]   See, giving is easy.
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.900]   Praying is easy.
[00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.940]   Going, that's the one where we all kind of, "Eh, I don't know."
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.900]   That's the one every missions weekend where you're anticipating, "When are they going
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:24.860]   to read the Great Commission?
[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.020]   When are they going to talk to me about going overseas?
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.440]   Where's the sign-up sheet for the missions trip?"
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.660]   Going is hard.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.380]   Going requires a lot.
[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.780]   Pastor James read our scripture, the Great Commission, and I want to read it to us one
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.620]   more time.
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:49.180]   When Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:55.340]   Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[00:12:55.340 --> 00:13:02.960]   of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:07.940]   And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age."
[00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:16.300]   There's one word, two-letter word, "go," that triggers so many different reactions in us.
[00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:21.460]   Many times we've applied the word "go" to missionaries in the traditional sense.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:28.060]   Missionaries, those who leave their home country, move to a foreign land, learn a new language,
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:35.000]   immerse themselves in an unfamiliar culture, and preach the gospel to win the lost of Christ.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.300]   For some, that thought is terrifying.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:43.260]   Thoughts start to invade our minds, like, "I could never leave my home country.
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.340]   I could never give up the comforts of my home.
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.500]   I could never learn a new language.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.820]   I could never learn a new culture."
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.340]   And these thoughts paralyze us.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:59.980]   And we don't even like to pray about going because we're afraid God just might answer
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:00.980]   that prayer.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.460]   Do we remember what Pastor Steve said last week?
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:10.380]   There are certain prayers we don't like to pray because we think God, we fear God just
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.020]   may answer that prayer.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:16.540]   He gave us a simple prayer last week that he prays every day.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.040]   He said, "Lord, bring me someone to serve today.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.780]   Don't raise your hands."
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.540]   But did we pray that prayer this week?
[00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.600]   I'm not going to look around, not going to make eye contact.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.300]   But did we pray that?
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.180]   I'll let you meditate on that with the Lord.
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:40.260]   But in the same manner, many of us don't want to pray about going out of fear that the Lord
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.780]   may answer and say, "Yes, I want you to go to a hard place.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:51.740]   Yes, I want you to go to this country, fill in the blank."
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.860]   Because if we're honest, we probably all have a country in mind that we think, "Oh God,
[00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.100]   send me anywhere but there."
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.580]   And it's different for each of us.
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:04.000]   "Oh God, please don't make me go there."
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:10.800]   So we don't even pray because we don't want God to answer that prayer.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.700]   Or how about this trigger from the word "go"?
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:19.580]   For some of us, we hear that word "go" and we get a sense of relief.
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:27.540]   Because for some of us, it is simply impossible to relocate internationally as a traditional
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.000]   missionary would.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.980]   And there are legitimate reasons for this.
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.020]   There may be health issues that prevent you from moving.
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:41.160]   There may be issues with your age or other true legitimate reasons that you could never
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.320]   move to a foreign country.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:50.420]   So for those people, sometimes there's a tendency to go, "I don't have to worry about it.
[00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:52.380]   I'm excused.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:56.960]   The mandate of 'go' does not apply to me."
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.640]   Well, yes it does, but I'm going to explain that.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:07.600]   You see, while our definitions of "go" and "missionary" have not been incorrect, I would
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:11.940]   suggest that our definitions have been too narrow.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:16.060]   And I would suggest that it's time to expand our definitions.
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.160]   Let's just be practical for a moment.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:25.760]   Every Christian in the city cannot leave and go to another country.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.100]   Cannot.
[00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.980]   We cannot all leave, especially at the same time.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:36.300]   Imagine if every Christian in the city of Hong Kong said, "Oh, God said go.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.300]   I'm leaving.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.740]   I'm going to another country, going overseas."
[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.260]   Fend for yourself.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.420]   Chaos would ensue.
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.400]   Darkness would take over.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:52.080]   Who would witness to the people still here if we all left?
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.500]   Everyone cannot go.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:59.280]   Everyone is not supposed to go in their traditional sense.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.140]   Some will be called to go to foreign lands, and I don't want to diminish that calling
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.180]   at all.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:05.780]   It is true.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:12.500]   Most of us in this room will never live as a traditional missionary in another country,
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.560]   but we are called to go.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:24.040]   So we must ask the question, "If I'm not called to go overseas, then what does 'go'
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.580]   mean to me?
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.640]   How am I to partner with God in the Great Commission?"
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:38.560]   We are privileged to live in Hong Kong, and for most of us, our 'go' simply means walk
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:45.380]   outside of our front door and see the nations that are right in front of us.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:53.280]   Even after the crazy tumultuous last three years, Hong Kong is still a global city.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.920]   Hong Kong is a place where people come and they go.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:59.940]   It's a transient city.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:05.600]   People come for work, they come for study, they come as refugees, they come for many
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:11.080]   different reasons, and for the most part, they come for a purpose, they achieve that
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:16.560]   purpose, and then they either return to their homeland or move on to another country.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:23.200]   I spoke with a friend of mine this week who works in the admissions department at HKU,
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:30.220]   and he told me that there are students at HKU from over 90 countries.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:37.360]   Over 90 countries are represented in just one university in our city.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.300]   Let that sink in for just a moment.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:46.200]   These students will be here for one to four years, depending on their program of study,
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:51.160]   then they're either going back home or going on to another country for work.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:55.320]   You and I are not going to 90 countries.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.020]   It's not going to happen.
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.060]   It's not possible.
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.080]   We don't have time.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.220]   We don't have the finances.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.880]   We don't have the language skills to go to 90.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.720]   Who speaks 90 languages?
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.900]   I've heard of polyglots who speak five and six and seven language, and those people amaze
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.900]   me.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:13.900]   I'm struggling with two.
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:20.460]   I struggle with two, but we don't have the language skills to go to 90 countries.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:25.660]   Do you know how long it would take us just to learn the languages and to learn the cultures?
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.500]   So we're not going, but they are.
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:38.360]   We can impact 90 nations just by reaching the visiting students at one university in
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.900]   our city.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.400]   And that's just one segment of our city.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.560]   There are many, many other countries represented in business, not to mention the over 300,000
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.600]   domestic workers employed in Hong Kong.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:01.840]   For many of us, Go means sharing the gospel with those closest to us, our family, our
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.880]   coworkers, our employees, or our employers.
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:12.080]   I have a very good friend who's been living here for over 25 years, and over her time
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.240]   here in Hong Kong, she's employed several domestic helpers at different times.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:23.320]   And each time, she has intentionally hired someone who is not a Christian.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:31.520]   With the express prayer in her heart of, "Oh God, please allow me to witness to my helper.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.540]   Please allow me to share the gospel with my helper."
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:40.300]   Each of her helpers eventually came to know Jesus.
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:45.480]   Each one of them, they went back to their home in the Philippines and won their families
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.480]   to Jesus.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:52.560]   And one of her helpers became a pastor in her home province in the Philippines.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.480]   Now see, my friend is never going to live in the Philippines.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.880]   That's not where God has called her to go.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.520]   God's called her here.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.800]   But she has answered the yes of the Go of the Great Commission by winning the person
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.100]   right in front of her.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:12.080]   She's been a very effective missionary to the Philippines.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:18.840]   Let me ask us, have we considered that the people we employ, whether domestic workers,
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:24.280]   people in our office, people in our school, have we considered that they could be part
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.200]   of the answer of Go for us?
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.160]   That's part of our Go, the people right in front of us.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.680]   See we sometimes disqualify ourselves from going with statements like, "I don't know
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.440]   enough to tell anybody about the gospel."
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.040]   "I'm not old enough."
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.800]   Or the flip side, "I'm too old.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.120]   I can't say anything."
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.480]   These are myths that keep us from going.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.200]   Let me help, and the biggest myth is, "I don't know enough."
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.740]   Let me help us with that one.
[00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.760]   We will never know enough.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.240]   We will never know enough doctrine.
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.080]   We will never know enough theology.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.560]   We will never know the Bible cover to cover.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.640]   We don't have to.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.800]   We just have to know what Jesus has done for us.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.520]   That's all we have to know to share the gospel.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:26.320]   Psalm 107, "Let the redeemed of the Lord tell their story."
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.040]   You see a connection is far more powerful when someone hears my story.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.960]   When they hear my story, they hear something they can relate to.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.440]   They're going to click onto that far quicker than they would about doctrinal statements
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.000]   or theological statements.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.360]   Sometimes we hesitate to go because we fear being unsuccessful.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.120]   We don't want to fail.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:58.320]   We live in such a results-driven world that the fear of failure can stop us in our tracks.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:04.160]   But God has a different definition of success and failure.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.440]   I love the way Mother Teresa said it, "God has not called me to be successful.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.120]   He's called me to be faithful."
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.920]   God has not called me to be successful.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.800]   He's called me to be faithful.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.360]   We will not find the instruction anywhere in the Bible, "Go be successful."
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.800]   It's not in there.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.600]   We've just been told to go.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.080]   And as we read some of the scriptures last week, again, as we've been studying in 1 Corinthians,
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.740]   we may be the one who plants.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.200]   We may be the one who waters.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.600]   The results, that's up to God.
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:53.280]   My job, your job, our job is to go, to plant or to water.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:01.760]   And as the band gets ready to come on up, I want to close with these words, with these
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.320]   last few thoughts.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.980]   God did not create a race of mindless, pre-programmed robots.
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:16.060]   He created us and has chose us to partner with him to reach the world with a message
[00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.100]   of salvation.
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:23.580]   In the Great Commission, he gave us a task and told us to go.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:29.980]   He's now brought the nations of the world to Hong Kong.
[00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:37.140]   1 Timothy 2.4 says, "God wants all people to be saved, to come to a knowledge of the
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.140]   truth."
[00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.180]   You see, the nations are here.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:47.700]   So if you reach Hong Kong with the gospel, you reach the world.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.980]   The world is right outside our front door.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.760]   The world is right beside us on the MTR.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:00.280]   The world is in our office, in our classroom.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:06.840]   Oswald Chambers said this, "We all want to do the will of God, and we know that there's
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:12.840]   nothing nearer to his heart than the evangelization of the world."
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:22.020]   And as the band prepares to lead us in a response, may I invite us to ask the Lord, "What does
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.880]   go mean to me?"
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.000]   What does go mean to me?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.640]   Let's make this our prayer.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:39.540]   Lord, please give me a willing heart to go to my family, to my coworkers, to my employees,
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:46.120]   to my employer, to organizations like Sons and Daughters, to lonely refugees and asylum
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:52.720]   seekers, to domestic workers, to university students far from home, to the world that
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:58.000]   you have brought to Hong Kong, and even to a foreign land.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
