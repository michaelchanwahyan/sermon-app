[00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.900]  有什麼發生?
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.900]  很多人害怕
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.900]  沒有自由
[00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.900]  所以他們就飛了去
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900]  很多人飛了去外國
[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.900]  加拿大

[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.900]  神啊,你帶領我去哪裡侍奉呢?
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900]  那時
[00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.900]  我婆婆和我阿姨
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.900]  她就搬了去多倫多

[00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.900]  我長大的時候
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900]  我想做牧師
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.900]  將來做牧師

[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.900]  沒有人想?
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.900]  沒有人覺得我想
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.900]  OK
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.900]  誰覺得是牧師的
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.900]  舉手
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.900]  OK
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.900]  下一個圖
[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.900]  其實
[00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900]  我之前
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:55.900]  小時候
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.900]  很喜歡Jim Carrey
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.900]  有沒有看過Jim Carrey
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.900]  Jim Carrey是
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.900]  這個演員
[00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.900]  他是The Mask
[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.900]  Pet Detective
[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.900]  OK
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.900]  他綠色
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.900]  因為他戴著口罩
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.900]  為什麼我喜歡Jim Carrey
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.900]  因為我覺得他很有趣
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.900]  還有很自由
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.900]  他想做誰都可以
[00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.900]  他做什麼都可以
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.900]  很好笑
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.900]  很搞笑
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.900]  所以我想做
[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.900]  做一個演員
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.900]  好像Jim Carrey
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.900]  但是
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.900]  我在教會
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.900]  有很多壓力
[00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.900]  是不是
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.900]  因為
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.900]  我爸爸是誰
[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.900]  是牧師
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.900]  我們看下一個圖
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.900]  我就在掙扎
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.900]  我的身分
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.900]  我就在掙扎
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.900]  我的身分
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.900]  因為做牧師
[00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.900]  都有很大的期望
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.900]  因為你做什麼
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.900]  會反映誰
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.900]  你做什麼會反映誰
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.900]  你的父母
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.900]  是不是
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.900]  會反映你的父母
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:59.900]  你乖的時候
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.900]  你做一個好
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.900]  好兒子
[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.900]  就好了
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.900]  做些不好的事
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.900]  教會的人
[00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.900]  看到你
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.900]  看到你在做什麼
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.900]  他就告訴你
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.900]  爸爸媽媽聽
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.900]  然後爸爸媽媽就跟你說
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.900]  你看著你
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.900]  你做什麼
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.900]  反映我
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.900]  是不是,有沒有壓力
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.900]  好像每個人
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.900]  在教會看著你
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.900]  心理傷害
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.900]  這是一個很好的
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.900]  心理分析
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.900]  下一個圖
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.900]  我就覺得自己
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.900]  好像被困住
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.900]  被別人的期望
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.900]  困住我
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.900]  有沒有人
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.900]  感覺被困住
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.900]  被人困住
[00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.900]  有沒有人感覺過
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.900]  我就被那些期望
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.900]  好像被困住
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.900]  好像沒有自由
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.900]  很想有自由
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.900]  好像Jim Carrey
[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.900]  可以做任何角色
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:02.900]  都可以
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.900]  但我覺得
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.900]  好像被困住
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.900]  我就開始找個身分
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.900]  在不同的地方
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.900]  我可能打球很厲害
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.900]  所以找個身分
[00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.900]  在打球那裡
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.900]  我彈琴也很厲害
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.900]  然後我就想找個身分
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.900]  在彈琴那裡
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.900]  去避免這個大期望
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.900]  在教會那裡
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.900]  但是
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.900]  如果我擺
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.900]  你的身分在不同的地方
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.900]  可能是好事
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.900]  甚至可能在教會服務
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.900]  都是好事
[00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.900]  我可以擺個身分在服務那裡
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.900]  但問題是什麼呢
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.900]  我打球
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.900]  可以贏
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.900]  但也可以輸
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.900]  是不是
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.900]  贏又輸
[00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.900]  贏又輸
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.900]  贏又輸
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:55.900]  是不是
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.900]  你彈琴的那些比賽
[00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:58.900]  誰考琴
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.900]  有比賽的
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.900]  去過比賽的
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.900]  Gabe,OK,Nice
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.900]  你可以贏
[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.900]  又不是第一個
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.900]  又第一
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.900]  可能包尾
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.900]  第一又包尾
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.900]  所以我找身分在不同的地方
[00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.900]  好像在滑雪機上
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.900]  滑雪機
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.900]  過山車
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.900]  我就開始
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.900]  找身分在什麼地方
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.900]  可以堅持
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.900]  有什麼可以在這個世界堅持
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.900]  有什麼是堅持的呢
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.900]  我就開始
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.900]  找主耶穌
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.900]  我八歲的時候
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.900]  我爸爸媽媽就帶我去信主
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.900]  我像你這樣
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.900]  在教會長大
[00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.900]  但有一個點
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.900]  我是要去認識主耶穌
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.900]  去祈禱
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.900]  去接受主耶穌是我的個人救主
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.900]  這裡就說
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.900]  Jesus replied
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.900]  Verily I tell you
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.900]  Everyone who sins is a slave to sin
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.900]  So if the son sets you free
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.900]  You will be free indeed
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.900]  我很喜歡自由
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.900]  但這個世界的東西
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.900]  我找的身分
[00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.900]  全部都不是很自由
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.900]  好像一個奴隸
[00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.900]  贏又輸
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.900]  人們的期望
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.900]  怎麼看你
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.900]  好像困住我
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:37.900]  但我開始找主耶穌
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.900]  他就說
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.900]  If the son sets you free
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.900]  You will be free indeed
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.900]  接著下一頁
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.900]  我就看到
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.900]  你認識神的時候
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.900]  你會怎樣
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.900]  你會注意到一個新的人
[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.900]  A new person
[00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.900]  Therefore if anyone is in Christ
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.900]  The new creation has come
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:04.900]  The old has gone
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.900]  The new is here
[00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.900]  我開始在神那裡
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.900]  找我的身分
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.900]  難不難
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.900]  容易嗎
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.900]  是難的
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.900]  不容易
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.900]  有時要
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.900]  做基督徒
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.900]  都是有上有下的
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.900]  但我繼續去追求主耶穌
[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.900]  有一天
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.900]  我們有一個夏日營
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.900]  下一頁
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.900]  夏日營有一個
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.900]  Dedication Night
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.900]  下一頁
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.900]  好像我們之前一樣
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.900]  營有一個Dedication Night
[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.900]  第一個心是去信靠主耶穌
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.900]  是我的教主
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.900]  第二是Living for Christ
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.900]  第二個Calling
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.900]  Dedication是Living for Christ
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.900]  第三個Calling
[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.900]  是Serving God full time
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.900]  你想像一下
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.900]  那個夏日營
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.900]  那天的Dedication
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.900]  Dedication Night
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.900]  我爸爸在那裡做Dedication
[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.900]  第三個心的時候
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.900]  他就問有沒有人
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.900]  願意去跟隨主耶穌
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.900]  去全奉獻自己
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.900]  去Serve the Lord full time
[00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.900]  我好像你們一樣
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.900]  坐在那裡乖乖的
[00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.900]  但我就開始感動了
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.900]  聖靈感動我
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.900]  He gave me a great emotion
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.900]  a passion
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.900]  那個passion是甚麼
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.900]  那個passion是耶穌給了我們
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.900]  He has given us everything
[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.900]  祂釘十字架為你們死
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.900]  那你的回應是甚麼呢
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.900]  聖靈就用這樣去感動我
[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.900]  好像這個next verse
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.900]  I have been crucified with Christ
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.900]  and I no longer live
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.900]  but Christ lives in me
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.900]  the life I now live in the body
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.900]  I live by faith in the Son of God
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.900]  who loved me and gave himself for me
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.900]  耶穌是給了祂自己給我們
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.900]  那我們的回應
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.900]  我的回應是甚麼呢
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.900]  我的回應是我會奉獻我自己給神
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.900]  去Serve 祂full time
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.900]  那我receive了這個calling的時候
[00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.900]  神就開始去equip我了
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.900]  我calling的時候是十四歲
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.900]  有沒有人是十四歲的呢
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:50.900]  舉手
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.900]  十四歲
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:52.900]  一個Peter
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:53.900]  這個
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.900]  兩個人十四歲
[00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.900]  神就差遣我了
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.900]  Give me a calling
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.900]  去十四歲
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:05.900]  去長時間奉獻去侍奉祂
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:06.900]  但是我十四歲
[00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.900]  我不知道神想怎樣
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.900]  I don't know when He is going to
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.900]  tell me to come serve full time
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.900]  那我又怎樣呢
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.900]  繼續去跟隨祂
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.900]  繼續去給祂equip我了
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.900]  OK 我們說了identity
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.900]  我們說了calling
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.900]  第三呢
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.900]  是equipping
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.900]  那我在多倫多長大
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.900]  我去了多倫多大學
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.900]  有沒有人想去多倫多大學讀書的
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.900]  你想讀甚麼
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.900]  還不知道
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:42.900]  不要緊
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.900]  神會帶領你
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.900]  我考考你
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.900]  next question
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:48.900]  next slide
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.900]  我在多倫多大學讀甚麼degree
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.900]  第一個選擇
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.900]  psychology and religion
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.900]  double major in psychology and religion

[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:21.900]  OK 看到你
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:26.900]  誰覺得我是double major in philosophy and economics的
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.900]  你們這麼認識我
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.900]  為甚麼我study經濟呢
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.900]  我其實對經濟是沒有興趣的
[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.900]  但我的mark是最高的
[00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.900]  因為我是logical
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.900]  economics你study是挺logical的
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.900]  第二呢

[00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.900]  是哲學
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.900]  明白別人的想法
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.900]  是為甚麼會相信不同的religion
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.900]  或者不相信神的
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:13:59.900]  是不是
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.900]  好
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.900]  我在多倫多大學的時候
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:07.900]  我就進了一個基督教的club
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.900]  學完傳道會
[00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.900]  OK next slide
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.900]  這個是我的group
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.900]  有沒有找到我
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:15.900]  我在哪裏
[00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.900]  在哪裏
[00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.900]  我不是在拍照的那個
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.900]  我是右邊那個
[00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.900]  和那個外國人旁邊那個
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.900]  因為我學完傳道會在那裏大學
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.900]  我在學完傳道會那裏
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:32.900]  next slide
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:39.900]  我們就開始和學生討論不同的屬靈的topic
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.900]  spiritual discussion
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.900]  有一次
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.900]  我和一個學完傳道會的學生出去
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.900]  和不同的學生randomly去聊天
[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.900]  不同的spiritual topic
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.900]  他就開始很生氣
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.900]  搞錯
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:58.900]  為甚麼你會相信會有神
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.900]  神給你那麼多suffering在這個世界
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.900]  搞錯
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.900]  有沒有人問過這個問題
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.900]  為甚麼神會給你suffering在這個世界
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.900]  有沒有
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.900]  沒有問過
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:12.900]  真的沒有問過
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:14.900]  覺得這個世界很開心
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.900]  很和平
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.900]  your life is perfect
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.900]  yes
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:18.900]  OK
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.900]  God bless you
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:27.900]  我after這次和這個人去聊屬靈的東西
[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:30.900]  就發現這個世界
[00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.900]  在我的Christian bubble出來的時候
[00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:38.900]  就看到這個世界真的很需要耶穌
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.900]  真的很需要神
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.900]  這個人很生氣
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.900]  為甚麼那麼多suffering
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.900]  我就很想幫他
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.900]  神就感動我第二次
[00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.900]  我想幫他去認識主耶穌
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:55.900]  在這個大學
[00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:56.900]  這個學完傳道會
[00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.900]  他就開始equip我
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.900]  去不同的方法
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.900]  學不同的方法
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:07.900]  怎樣去和學生溝通不同的spiritual topic

[00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:50.900]  yeah I'm on the right there
[00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.900]  on the right
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.900]  ok I'm on the right
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.900]  我在神學
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.900]  就在多倫多讀神學
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.900]  這個神學其實很難的
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.900]  因為多數language你不會讀那麼長
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.900]  但他要求我讀三年Greek
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:08.900]  和兩年Hebrew
[00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.900]  三年Greek and two years of Hebrew
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.900]  so a lot tougher
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.900]  ok especially the languages
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.900]  神怎樣繼續去equip我呢?
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.900]  我們看next slide
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.900]  vision for the world
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.900]  繼續next slide
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.900]  神就帶了我去不同的短孫
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.900]  第一呢
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.900]  你猜猜這個國家是哪裡來的?
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.900]  非洲?不是非洲
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.900]  India
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:38.900]  India
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.900]  誰去過India?
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:41.900]  India
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.900]  ok我去過India呢
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.900]  你一去India呢
[00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.900]  哇 your senses come alive
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:50.900]  ok your senses come alive
[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.900]  哇你聞到一些沒聞過的東西
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.900]  你看到一些沒看過的東西
[00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:57.900]  這個是India
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.900]  wow the poverty
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:01.900]  那些need
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.900]  神就帶我去看
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.900]  這個世界有很多不同的need
[00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.900]  最重要是spiritual need
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.900]  接著next slide

[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:19.900]  是哪裡來的?
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.900]  是哪裡?

[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:23.900]  Uganda
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.900]  有沒有人去過Uganda?
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.900]  神就讓我去看
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:28.900]  哇Uganda
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.900]  其實很多人信主耶穌的
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:33.900]  但是他們的faith
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.900]  他們的信仰不是強的
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.900]  每個星期日就alter call
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.900]  每個星期都接受主耶穌的
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.900]  但是星期日到星期六
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:48.900]  就做回他們自己的事
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.900]  星期日就悔改認識主耶穌
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.900]  決志
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:56.900]  星期一到六就去回他們的life
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.900]  接著
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:59.900]  ok on my right
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:00.900]  是什麼國家?
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.900]  你猜猜

[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.900]  Iran

[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:23.900]  是一個Prophet
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.900]  但是他們沒有一個Savior
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.900]  沒有一個True Savior
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.900]  他們很需要主耶穌
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.900]  2016了
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:34.900]  去到2016了

[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.900]  不是在sports, winning and losing
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.900]  不是在competition, winning first or last
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.900]  我find我的identity在哪裡?
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.900]  在主耶穌
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.900]  第二,神就開始call我

[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.900]  怎樣看到人的need
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.900]  然後我就開始去serve
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.900]  next slide
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.900]  你今天
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:45.900]  你find你的identity在哪裡?
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.900]  你的identity是你的iPhone嗎?
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.900]  你是不是find你的identity
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.900]  你的打機有多厲害?
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.900]  你的分數呢?
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.900]  你考試的成績呢?
[00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:05.900]  你find你的identity是什麼呢?
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.900]  我鼓勵你去find你的identity
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.900]  your sense of worth in Christ
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.900]  because only the love of God
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:16.900]  in this world is constant
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.900]  everything else goes up and down
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.900]  like a roller coaster
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.900]  你可以考得好,又考得不好
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.900]  考得好,又考得不好
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.900]  但你find你的identity
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.900]  在你的mark的時候
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.900]  你就好像這樣
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.900]  你的roller coaster
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.900]  但如果你find你的identity
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.900]  在耶穌那裡
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.900]  his love for us
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.900]  never changes
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.900]  第二個問題是什麼?
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.900]  What is God calling you to be?
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.900]  我相信
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:49.900]  each one of us
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.900]  God has a calling for each one of us
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.900]  不是每個人都做牧師或傳導人
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:59.900]  God has a calling for you
[00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.900]  可能做一個工程師
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.900]  一個醫生
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.900]  一個whatever
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.900]  God has a calling for you
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.900]  What is God's calling for you?
[00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.900]  Will you be willing to seek God's calling?
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:17.900]  And then next
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.900]  equipping
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.900]  Are you willing to be equipped?
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:22.900]  At this church
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.900]  we can equip you to serve Jesus
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.900]  to know God more
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.900]  to understand Him more
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.900]  and are you willing to serve?
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.900]  And so this is sort of my story
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.900]  I found my identity in Christ
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:38.900]  next slide
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.900]  I found my identity in Christ
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.900]  I was called to full-time ministry
[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.900]  I was equipped to make disciples
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.900]  and most of all
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:51.900]  I am serving Jesus
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.900]  上個禮拜
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.900]  Pastor Michelle就說
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.900]  Our story is not finished
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.900]  next slide
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.900]  What will your story be?
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.900]  你十年後
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:06.900]  二十年後
[00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.900]  After you look at your life
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.900]  What will your story be?
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.900]  You can decide what your story will be
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.900]  You can choose to follow Jesus
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.900]  or follow the world
[00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.900]  What will your story be?
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.900]  Let's pray together
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:30.900]  Dear Heavenly Father
