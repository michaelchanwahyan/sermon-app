[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.420]   Good evening and welcome to KFC Online.
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.080]   So pleased to have your company this evening.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.960]   We can't wait to get back together to see each other face to face.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.800]   But in the meantime, please feel free to join in the service as we worship together as we
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.600]   sing this song about Jesus Christ, our cornerstone.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:53.000]   [Music]
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:06.600]   My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:24.200]   I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:38.200]   My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:53.000]   I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly trust in Jesus' name.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Christ our Lord, cornerstone, weak but strong.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   In the Savior's love, through the storm, He is the Lord of all.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   While darkness seems to hide His face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   In every high and stormy vale, my anchor holds within the veil.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Christ our Lord, cornerstone, weak but strong.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   In the Savior's love, through the storm, He is the Lord of all.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   He is the Lord of all.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:54.600]   When He shall come with trumpet sound, oh, may I then in Him be found.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:09.800]   Dressed in His righteousness alone, faultless stand before the throne.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:20.200]   Christ our Lord, cornerstone, weak but strong.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   In the Savior's love, through the storm, He is the Lord of all.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   Christ our Lord, cornerstone, weak but strong.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   In the Savior's love, through the storm, He is the Lord of all.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   He is the Lord of all.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   [Piano interlude]
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:56.200]   There was a moment when the lights went out, when death had claimed its victory.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   The King of love had given up His life, the darkest day of history.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:26.200]   There on a cross they made for sinners, for every curse His blood atoned.
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   One final breath and it was finished, but not the end we could have known.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   For the earth began to shake and the veil was torn.
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:07:05.200]   But sacrifice was made as the heavens roared.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   All hail King Jesus, all hail the Lord of heaven and earth.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   All hail King Jesus, all hail the Savior of the world.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:55.200]   There was a moment when the sky lit up, a flash of light that came through.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:02.200]   When all was lost, He crossed eternity.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   The King of life was on the move, for in a dark cold tomb,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   where our Lord was laid, a miraculous birth, a forever change.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:47.200]   All hail King Jesus, all hail the Lord of heaven and earth.
[00:08:47.200 --> 00:09:01.200]   All hail King Jesus, all hail the Savior of the world.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   All hail King Jesus, all hail the Lord of heaven and earth.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   All hail King Jesus, all hail the Savior of the world.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   Let every knee, let every knee come bow before the King of kings.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:53.200]   Let every tongue confess that He is Lord.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   Lift up your shout, let us join with all of heaven singing.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   Holy, singing holy.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   Cloud holy, singing holy.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   All hail.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   All hail King Jesus, all hail the Lord of heaven and earth.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:11:15.200]   All hail King Jesus, all hail the Savior of the world.
[00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.200]   Thank you, worship team.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   I just wanted to say a few words about the next few weeks.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   Obviously at the moment, we're so keen to get back face to face,
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.200]   but at the moment government restrictions don't allow that to happen.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   Just to say that we're going to be back together as soon as we possibly can.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   But I just want to share with you a couple of things that we're doing.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   We're planning on the 2nd of May for all the churches,
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   the international churches of Hong Kong, to gather together for an online service.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   We're going to be part of that.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.200]   I want you to put that date in your diary now, 2nd of May,
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   as we join with all of our colleagues in the different churches across this city
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.200]   to worship our God together.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   Then we'll be starting a sermon series in Esther.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   Because I want to tell you that you were born for such a time as this.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:23.200]   The Esther story is one of the most realistic biblical accounts of God's providence,
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:29.200]   precisely because God seems absent.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   It shows how the unseen God often works through human history,
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   not by miraculous intervention, but through completely ordinary events.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   In the book of Esther, a string of coincidences occur
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   in order for the Jewish nation to be saved.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:58.200]   A drunken and boastful king, a self-respecting queen, a beauty pageant,
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   a sensuous girl, an overheard plot, and a timely insomnia.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:09.200]   God even uses morally questionable decisions
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:14.200]   to work all things together for the good of his people.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.200]   And through these inscrutable and seemingly insignificant means,
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.200]   he advances his purpose in the Esther story.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:32.200]   God cares less about appearances and more about his sovereignty.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.200]   Today, as we go through the coronavirus,
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   if we can't see God at work in political decisions in Washington,
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   or in medical ethics or healthcare, or in events in our daily life,
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   we must not conclude he is not working.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   Esther teaches that in the providence of his people,
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   he's working out salvation for his people.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   The Esther story is a reversal of the expected.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   What appears inevitable is not.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.200]   Who appears powerful is not.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   Appearances are not what they seem.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   The author teaches us to make fun of the very forces that once threatened
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.200]   and will again threaten our existence,
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:24.200]   and thereby makes us recognise their triviality as well as their power.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   Today isn't the end of the story either.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.200]   The powers that seem in control are not in control.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:37.200]   The trajectory that seems inevitable is not inevitable.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   You were born for such a time as this.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.200]   Welcome to the Esther story.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   We have this exciting opportunity happening in May.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   We're going to try and do Alpha online.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.200]   So if you have friends or family that are interested in exploring life questions
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   and basics about Christianity, you can invite them to join.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   And now I'm going to ask Bonnie and James to come and to pray for us.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   Lord, just thank you so much for giving us this time, Lord.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   Thank you so much for technology, Lord, that allows us to, yeah,
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:23.200]   to be really able to still come together to worship your word,
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   to listen to your worship online,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   and to just hear Pastor Johnny preach the sermon on Jesus' resurrection.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   Lord, today I just want to pray for Hong Kong.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   I pray that in the midst of the economy, Lord,
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.200]   I just pray that you would continue to provide.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.200]   I just pray that you would continue to give people hope, Lord,
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   especially when we're in such a time of darkness, Lord.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   And I pray that where people are unable to find their life and hope, Lord,
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   I just pray that you would reach out and touch them, that you would also, yeah, Lord,
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.200]   just allow us to comply with government regulations,
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   but also find ways to care and love for our brothers and sisters in need.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   Lord, I just pray that you would send us out while we are able to still respect our authorities, Lord.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   Send us out to also share resources with people, to just care for them and to just love them.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   And yeah, Lord, I just pray that while you would also help those who are financially struggling, Lord,
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   I also pray that you would, yeah, Lord, allow us to be your hands and feet.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   And Father, Lord, we also lift up this whole world in prayer.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.200]   We truly believe that you have the whole world in your hands.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   And as the virus continues to spread around the world, we pray that your good news will also spread.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   And we pray that your kingdom will continue to move and work in the hearts of many.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   We pray for the church as a whole, your body, that you will guide,
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   your spirit will guide us in how to respond and how to love and how to serve the communities that you've placed us in.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   We pray for the leaders in the world who have tough decisions to make every single day.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   We pray that you will grant them wisdom and love as they navigate these uncharted waters.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   So we thank you again for you, God, because you are faithful and you are good.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   We pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.200]   Amen.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   So I'll pray again.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   I'll just introduce him.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   Introduce him.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   Okay.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   And now I'll pass the time over to Pastor Johnny, who's going to be delivering us the Word today.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:47.200]   Hi KFC.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   So awesome to be with you today.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   And today we're going to be talking about the King's resurrection.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:59.200]   John last week did a great job of explaining to us the King's ransom.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   He went through Palm Sunday in which Jesus was celebrated as he went in and entered into Jerusalem.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   He talked about the Lord's Supper.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   And shortly after that, the King was betrayed by his own disciple.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   The King was then denied by his friend when he was in trial.
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.200]   The King was rejected by his people.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   Barnabas was chosen over this King.
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:32.200]   The King was stripped, beaten, and mocked.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   And then on Good Friday, the King was crucified.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   The King was crucified on the cross.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   And so the mood is very sad.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   The disciples dispersed like a sheep, like a shepherd, like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.200]   They hid.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:02.200]   And on that morning, Easter Sunday, the women came out.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   And we read in Matthew chapter 28.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:35.200]   The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   He is not here. He has risen.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.200]   Just as he said, 'Come and see the place where he lay.'
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   Then go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has risen from the dead and going ahead of you into Galilee.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.200]   There you will see him. Now I have told you.'"
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.200]   We're going to talk about three things here today.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   The first thing that we notice is that the angel says, "He is risen.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:18.200]   Jesus is king over death. Jesus is king over death."
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   In these times, we've seen so much death.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   The latest tolls, tallies are there is over 130,000 deaths because of this coronavirus.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:37.200]   People are fearing death. People are afraid to die.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   But Jesus conquers over death.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   Jesus is the only person that has died and rose again.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   Mohammed the prophet died and did not rise.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.200]   Buddha died. Confucius died.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.200]   But Jesus is the only one that died and rose again.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.200]   He is the ultimate sacrifice for us.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   In the olden days, in the Old Testament, they had to bring a lamb to sacrifice to represent their sin.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.200]   But Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:19.200]   We no longer have to bring a sacrifice because Jesus died once and for all.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   And now we no longer have to fear death as well because Jesus has conquered death on the cross.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   The second thing we notice is that he is risen, that the king is king over life.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   Jesus is king over life.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   The virus makes us reflect upon life, what life really is about.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   Life is short. Life is so fragile.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   Life on earth is finite.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   We treasure the important things. We start to treasure the important things during these times.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   The family that we have, the friends that we've met.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:15.200]   We start to question what is the purpose of our life, the goals that we have and the accomplishments that we've made.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   The first thing that Jesus really proposes to us is that he came so that we could have life and have it to the fullest.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   Have it abundantly. He says that in John chapter 10, verse 10.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.200]   So many people are alive but yet do not truly live.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.200]   Jesus is king of life.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:52.200]   Jesus says, "What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, all the riches, yet forfeit his soul?
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.200]   Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?"
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:02.200]   Jesus is king over life, life to the fullest.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   And in John it also says that now this is eternal life, that we may know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   Jesus is not only king over this life but eternal life, the eternal life.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:26.200]   If we know Jesus Christ, we have eternal life.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:32.200]   And the last thing it says, the angel said, "He is risen just as he said."
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.200]   Just as he said.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   Jesus is the king of truth. His words are truth.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:49.200]   Jesus claimed that in three days he would rise.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   Tear down the temple and in three days I will raise it again. That he would go away for a little while and then he will appear again.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   He is the truth. His words are truth.
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.200]   They tried to even suppress this truth.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   They, Rome, tried to put Roman guards to have a Roman seal of this tomb so that nobody could get this body.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.200]   So that Jesus' words would not be true.
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   But yet the angel came and opened the tomb and Jesus rose from the dead.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   The Jews also tried to suppress the truth.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:36.200]   They paid the soldiers to say the disciples came and stole the body.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   But we know that the testimony of the disciples is that Jesus rose, he appeared and rose from the dead.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   Jesus also fulfills more than 300 prophecies in the Old Testament.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:05.200]   His birth, his life, his miracles, the suffering that he had, the death and his resurrection was all prophesied in the Old Testament.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:16.200]   And it has become true. He is the promise. The promise fulfilled as it was written in the Old Testament.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:22.200]   So Jesus is king over death. He is our ultimate sacrifice.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:28.200]   Jesus is the king of life. He is our Messiah.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   Jesus is king of truth. He is the promise. The promise fulfilled.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.200]   We're going to continue to read verse 8 to 10.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:45.200]   So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   Suddenly Jesus met them. "Greetings!" he said.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.200]   They came to him, collapsed at their feet, and worshipped him.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me."
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:16.200]   Jesus met these women. And what happened? They collapsed at his feet and worshipped him.
[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:23.200]   Muhammad was never worshipped. Right? Muhammad was never worshipped.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   He never said, "I am a prophet." Confucius was never worshipped.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   He never claimed that he was God. But Jesus claimed that he is the I Am.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   He is the Messiah. He is the Alpha and the Omega. The second person of the Trinity.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   He was there in creation. All things were made in and through him.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   Jesus accepted this worship. He didn't say, "Oh no, don't worship me."
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.200]   He accepted this worship as they collapsed at their feet and worshipped him.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:06.200]   He is the Lord. He is our God. This is the King of the Universe.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.200]   Jesus is King of our Universe.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   And lastly, we see that Jesus is a personal King.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:22.200]   Usually kings are in their castles. They're protected by their secret security.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   But no, this king is a personal king.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   In the passage earlier, we saw that the angel instructed the woman to go tell the disciples that he's going to come to them.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:42.200]   Jesus himself says, "Tell my brothers in Galilee. There they will see me."
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:46.200]   Jesus was in the tomb for three days.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   And the first thing he wanted to do when he came out of the tomb was to see his people.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.200]   To see his disciples.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   He could have gone for a nice steak or another Passover dinner.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:06.200]   No, no, he didn't do that. He wanted to go to see his people.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:12.200]   And we know that Jesus appeared to more than 500 people.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.200]   His disciples and over 500 people.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   And that is one of the reasons we know that Jesus did rise from the dead.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   Because of the testimony of these disciples.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.200]   And later, their changed lives.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.200]   That they were willing to die for this truth.
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   Even to death on the cross.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   Some of them martyrs as well.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   Peter upside down on the cross.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.200]   So Jesus is our personal king.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:47.200]   He is a king that understands the things that we've gone through.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   In Hebrews, it says that we have a high priest who is able to empathize with our weaknesses.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   He understands the things that we've gone through.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   Yet he has overcome those things.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   Jesus is also a personal king that wants to know each one of you.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:15.200]   He says in Revelation chapter 3 verse 20, "Here I stand. I stand at the door and knock.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:25.200]   If anyone opens, hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person and they with me."
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.200]   Jesus wants to be in your life.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:35.200]   Are you willing to open the door of your heart to let Jesus in to your life?
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   To be your Lord and Savior?
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.200]   So today we talked about five things.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.200]   That Jesus is king over death.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   He is our ultimate sacrifice.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.200]   He is the bridge that allows us to be restored with the Lord.
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.200]   He is the wrath of God was taken upon him.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.200]   He is the king of life.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   He allows us to live life to the fullest and abundantly.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.200]   He is eternal life.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.200]   If we know Jesus Christ, we have eternal life.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   He is our Messiah.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.200]   Jesus is king of truth.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   Every word he says is true.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.200]   He is our promise.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   The promises that were fulfilled in the Old Testament.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.200]   He is the king of the universe.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   The women worshipped at his feet.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   He is our God.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.200]   And lastly, he is a personal king.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   He is a king that understands the things that we've gone through.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.200]   He is our high priest.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:45.200]   And he wants to be the king over your life.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:50.200]   Is Jesus king in your life?
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   Is Jesus king in your life?
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:31:01.200]   I think as I've grown up throughout the teenage years,
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   I've started to logically understand more and more that all the religions of the world teach that you can do something.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   In Islam, you have to pray five times a day.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:18.200]   You have to go to the pilgrimage in order for Allah to accept you.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   In Hinduism, you have to worship all these gods and fulfill all their things so that they will save you.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.200]   But only in Christianity is it that we cannot save ourselves.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.200]   That we need a savior.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.200]   We need Jesus Christ.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.200]   And I logically began to understand that more and more.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   And when I understood that logically, Jesus became the king over my life.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   Recently, my friend just became more and more serious about Jesus.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   And as he was having dinner with his father, his father was like, "This is the golden age of your life.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   You're in your 30s. Now is the time to make money and prosper."
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   And he's like, "I now have a new perspective of life."
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.200]   This new perspective is that life is more than just this world.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   There is eternal life.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   Jesus has become king over his life.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   And now I'm going to invite Paul.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:26.200]   And he's going to share a little bit about how Jesus has become king over his own life.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:32.200]   So, Jesus being king over my personal life has really been something that's been happening over time
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.200]   as He's been weeding out different aspects.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   But one clear moment to me in my life was really when I was 18.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.200]   God was really talking to me about taking my faith more seriously.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:50.200]   And part of that was actually just giving up getting drunk and going out drinking.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:55.200]   At that time, it was really difficult for me.
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.200]   It didn't even make sense.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   It was something I could hide my insecurities behind, such as fear of not being able to relate to people.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   And even as a Christian, I just found it hard to reconcile that and make sense of it.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   But it was what I needed to do, and so I had to do it.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:24.200]   And then, I'm reflecting, at that time I was allowing drinking to actually guide my actions and my thoughts
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.200]   more than what I was allowing God to and allowing Jesus to.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:34.200]   And so, I was actually drinking more authority than I was giving Jesus.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:40.200]   So, that authority needed to go back, whether or not it made sense to me at that time.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:46.200]   And so, I'm not sure if that's the most significant, but it was definitely the most significant to me in feeling
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.200]   as it was quite difficult.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   Since then, really, it's just been a process of God showing different areas to me where I need to hand that authority back to Him,
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   whether that's how I spend my time, the words that come out of my mouth, and just different areas like that
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:13.200]   where I've wanted to have my own rule, and just on each of those areas, God's pressed me just to allow Him to be king in that.
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   Thanks so much, Paul.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:23.200]   And I'm hoping today that if you have not allowed Jesus to be in your life, to be king over your life,
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.200]   that you could make a decision today.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.200]   And I would love to pray with you.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.200]   And you can make this decision as we pray to God.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.200]   Prayer is our communication with God.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:39.200]   God is not as concerned with the words of your mouth as He is with the attitude of your heart.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   And so, if you would like to invite Jesus to be king over your life, we can pray now.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.200]   Pray with me.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   Dear Father, we thank you for Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.200]   His death and His resurrection.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:02.200]   And in three days, He proved that He is king over death.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   He is king over life.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   He is king of truth.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   The king of this universe, our God.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   And He is a personal king.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:22.200]   And now, Lord, I want to invite you into my life to be my Lord and Savior.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   Would you come into my life and make me the person you want me to be?
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   Forgive me of my sins.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.200]   In Christ's name I pray. Amen.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:38.200]   Bless you, KFC.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   And I pray that, Lord, you would take this message of our Lord's resurrection to your friends and your family as well.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.200]   God bless you.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   [Music]
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.200]   [Music]
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.200]   The moon and stars, they wept.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.200]   The morning sun was dead.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   The Savior of the world was fallen.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.200]   His body on the cross.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.200]   His blood poured out for us.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:48.200]   The weight of every curse upon Him.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.200]   [Music]
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:37:06.200]   One final breath He gave.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.200]   As heaven looked to Him.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   The Son of God was laid in darkness.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.200]   A battle in the ground.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.200]   The war on death was raised.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:31.200]   The power of hell's scepter broken.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.200]   The ground began to shake.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.200]   The stone was rolled away.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   His perfect love could not be overcome.

[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   The stone was rolled away.
