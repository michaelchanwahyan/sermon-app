[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Hi KFC, so awesome to be with you today. And today we're going to be talking
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.960]   about the King's resurrection. John last week did a great job of explaining to us
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.840]   the King's ransom. He went through Palm Sunday in which Jesus was celebrated as
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.920]   he went in and entered into Jerusalem. He talked about the Lord's Supper and
[00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.120]   shortly after that the King was betrayed by his own disciple. The King was then
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.920]   denied by his friend when he was in trial. The King was rejected by his
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.440]   people. Barnabas was chosen over this King. The King was stripped,
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:53.040]   beaten and mocked. And then on Good Friday the King was crucified. The King
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:03.240]   was crucified on the cross. And so the mood is very sad. The disciples
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:10.280]   dispersed like a sheep, like a shepherd, like sheep without a shepherd. They hid.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:19.040]   But on that morning, Easter Sunday, the women came out. And we read in Matthew
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.080]   chapter 28, "After the Sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.840]   and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. There was a violent earthquake for
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.560]   an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.640]   the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning and his clothes were
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.120]   white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.000]   dead men. The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid for I know that you are
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.200]   looking for Jesus who was crucified. He is not here. He has risen just as he said.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.240]   Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples he has
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.480]   risen from the dead and going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.960]   now I have told you." We're going to talk about three things here today. The first
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:29.000]   thing that we notice is that the angel says, "He is risen. Jesus is king over
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.480]   death. Jesus is king over death." In these times, we've seen so much death. The latest
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.000]   tolls tallies are there is over 130,000 deaths because of this coronavirus.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.520]   People are fearing death. People are afraid to die. But Jesus conquers over
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.640]   death. Jesus is the only person that has died and rose again.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:08.800]   Muhammad the Prophet died and did not rise. Buddha died. Confucius died. But
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:16.720]   Jesus is the only one that died and rose again. He is the ultimate sacrifice for
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.920]   us. In the olden days, you know, in the Old Testament, they had to bring a lamb to
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.680]   sacrifice to represent their sin. But Jesus is the ultimate sacrifice. We no
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.480]   longer have to bring a sacrifice because Jesus died once and for all. And now we
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.040]   no longer have to fear death as well because Jesus has conquered death on the
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:50.520]   cross. The second thing we notice is that he is risen, that the King is king over
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:59.520]   life. Jesus is king over life. The virus makes us reflect upon life, what life
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:10.160]   really is about. Life is short. Life is so fragile. Life on earth is finite. We
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.280]   treasure the important things. We start to treasure the important things during
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:21.800]   these times. The family that we have, the friends that we've met, we start to
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.120]   question what is the purpose of our life, the goals that we have, and the
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:36.640]   accomplishments that we've made. The first thing that Jesus really proposes
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.920]   to us is that he came so that we could have life and have it to the fullest,
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:49.880]   have it abundantly. He says that in John chapter 10 verse 10. So many people are
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:05:00.080]   alive but yet do not truly live. Jesus is king of life. Jesus says, "What good is it
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.920]   for a man to gain the whole world, all the riches, yet forfeit his soul?
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.040]   Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul?" Jesus is
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.880]   king over life, life to the fullest. And in John it also says that now this is
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.360]   eternal life, that we may know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom you have
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.680]   sent. Jesus is not only king over this life, but eternal life, the eternal life.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:43.320]   If we know Jesus Christ, we have eternal life. And the last thing it says, the
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:52.320]   angel said, "He is risen just as he said, just as he said." Jesus is the king of
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:04.600]   truth. His words are truth. Jesus claimed that in three days he would rise, tear
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.360]   down the temple, and in three days I will raise it again, that he would go away for
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.760]   a little while and then he will appear again. He is the truth. His words are
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:24.000]   truth. They tried to even suppress this truth, right? They, Rome tried to put Roman
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.720]   guards to have a Roman seal of this tomb so that nobody could get this body, so
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:36.200]   that Jesus' words would not be true. But yet the angel came and opened the tomb
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:46.600]   and Jesus rose from the dead. The Jews also tried to suppress the truth. They
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:54.400]   paid the soldiers to say the disciples came and stole the body. But we know that
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:02.240]   the testimony of the disciples is that Jesus rose, he appeared and rose from the
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:11.160]   dead. Jesus also fulfills more than 300 prophecies in the Old Testament. His
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.760]   birth, his life, his miracles, the suffering that he had, the death, and his
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.760]   resurrection was all prophesied in the Old Testament, and it has become true. He
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:32.640]   is the promise, the promise fulfilled as it was written in the Old Testament. So
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   Jesus is king over death. He is our ultimate sacrifice. Jesus is the king of
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:49.320]   life. He is our Messiah. Jesus is king of truth. He is the promise, the promise
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.480]   fulfilled. We're gonna continue to read verse 8 to 10. So the women hurried away
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:01.480]   from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.760]   Jesus met them. "Greetings," he said. They came to him, collapsed at their feet, and
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:16.400]   worshipped him. Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:26.080]   to Galilee. There they will see me." Jesus met these women, and what happened? They
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:35.920]   collapsed at his feet and worshipped him. Muhammad was never worshipped, right?
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.080]   Muhammad was never worshipped. He just said, you know, "I am a prophet."
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:46.360]   Confucius was never worshipped. He never claimed that he was God, but Jesus
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   claimed that he is the I Am. He is the Messiah. He is the Alpha and the Omega,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.680]   the second person of the Trinity. He was there in creation. All things were made
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:06.040]   in and through him. Jesus accepted this worship. He didn't say, "Oh no, don't
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.480]   worship me." No, he accepted this worship as they collapsed at their feet and
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:21.160]   worshipped him. He is the Lord. He is our God. This is the King of the universe.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:30.240]   Jesus is King of our universe. And lastly, we see that Jesus is a personal King.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:36.040]   Usually kings are in their castles. They're protected by their secret
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:45.840]   security, but no, this King is a personal King. In the passage earlier, we saw that
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.320]   the angel instructed the woman to go tell the disciples that he's gonna come
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:56.160]   to them. Jesus himself says, "Tell my brothers in Galilee. There they will see
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:04.400]   me." Jesus was in the tomb for three days, and the first thing he wanted to do when
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:11.680]   he came out of the tomb was to see his people, to see his disciples. He could
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.400]   have gone for a nice steak or another Passover dinner. No, no, he didn't do that.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:25.600]   He wanted to go to see his people, and we know that Jesus appeared to more than
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:32.760]   500 people, his disciples and over 500 people, and that is one of the reasons we
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:39.440]   know that Jesus did rise from the dead because of the testimony of these
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.160]   disciples, and later their changed lives, that they were willing to die for this
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:51.240]   truth, even to death on the cross. Some of them martyrs as well, right? Peter
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:59.400]   upside down on the cross. So Jesus is our personal King. He is a King that
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.480]   understands the things that we've gone through. In Hebrews, it says that we have
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:11.400]   a high priest who is able to empathize with our weaknesses. He understands the
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:18.440]   things that we've gone through, yet he has overcome those things. Jesus is also a
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.960]   personal King that wants to know each one of you. He says in Revelation chapter
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:34.720]   3 verse 20, "Here I stand. I stand at the door and knock. If anyone opens, hears my
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.160]   voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person and they with
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:47.200]   me." Jesus wants to be in your life. Are you willing to open the door of your
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:56.280]   heart to let Jesus in to your life, to be your Lord and Savior? So today we talked
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:02.680]   about five things. That Jesus is King over death. He is our ultimate sacrifice.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:09.280]   He is the bridge that allows us to be restored with the Lord. He is the wrath
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.120]   of God was taken upon him. He is the King of life. He allows us to live life to the
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:23.400]   fullest and abundantly. He is eternal life. If we know Jesus Christ, we have
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:33.280]   eternal life. He is our Messiah. Jesus is King of truth. Every word he says is true.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:39.840]   He is our promise, the promises that were fulfilled in the Old Testament. He is the
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:46.800]   King of the universe, the women worshipped at his feet. He is our God.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:53.040]   And lastly, he's a personal King. He's a King that understands the things that
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:59.160]   we've gone through. He is our High Priest and he wants to be the King over your
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:11.120]   life. Is Jesus King in your life? Is Jesus King in your life? I think as I've grown
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:18.480]   up throughout the teenage years, I've started to logically understand more and
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.960]   more that all the religions of the world teach that you can do something, right? In
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.000]   Islam, you have to pray five times a day. You have to go to the pilgrimage,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:35.440]   you know, in order for Allah to accept you. In Hinduism, you got to, you know,
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.040]   worship all these gods and fulfill all their things so that they will save you.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:47.720]   But only in Christianity is it that we cannot save ourselves, that we need a
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:54.880]   Savior. We need Jesus Christ. And I logically began to understand that more
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.240]   and more. And when I understood that logically, Jesus became the King over my
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:05.280]   life. Recently, my friend, you know, just became more and more serious about
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.680]   Jesus. And as he was having dinner with his father, his father was like, "This is
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:15.680]   the golden age of your life. You're in your 30s. Now is the time to make money
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:22.640]   and prosper." And he's like, "I now have a new perspective of life." This new
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.920]   perspective is that life is more than just this world. There is eternal life.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:34.480]   Jesus has become King over his life. And now I'm going to invite Paul, and he's
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:40.680]   going to share a little bit about how Jesus has become King over his own life.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:46.320]   So Jesus being King over my personal life has really been something that's
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.600]   been happening over time as he's been weeding out different aspects. But one
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:57.440]   clear moment to me in my life was really when I was 18, and God was
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.600]   really talking to me about taking my faith more seriously. And part of that
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:06.440]   was actually just giving up getting drunk and going out drinking. And at
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:12.640]   that time, it was really difficult for me. It didn't even make sense.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.600]   It was something I could hide my insecurities behind, such as, you know, fear of not
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.480]   being able to relate to people. And even as a Christian, then I just found it hard
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.920]   to reconcile that and make sense of it. But it was what I needed to do, and so I
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:35.000]   had to do it. And then from reflecting, at that time I was allowing
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.120]   drinking to actually guide my actions and my thoughts more than what I
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.920]   was allowing God to, and allowing Jesus to. And so I was actually giving that
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:51.320]   drinking more authority than I was giving Jesus. So that authority needed to
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.640]   go back, whether or not it made sense to me at that time. And so I'm not sure if
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.360]   that's the most significant, but it was definitely the most significant to me in
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.600]   feeling, as it was quite difficult. And since then, really, it's just
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.680]   been a process of God showing different areas to me where I need to hand that
[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:15.900]   authority back to Him, whether that's how I spend my time, the words that come
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:20.280]   out of my mouth, and just different areas like that where I've
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.900]   wanted to have my own rule, and just on each of those areas God's pressed me
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:32.040]   just to allow Him to be king in that. Thanks so much, Paul. And I'm hoping
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:37.740]   today that if you have not allowed Jesus to be in your life, to be king over your
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:44.480]   life, that you can make a decision today. And I would love to pray with you, and
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.600]   you can make this decision as we pray to God. Prayer is our communication with God.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.320]   God is not as concerned with the words of your mouth as He is with the attitude
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.560]   of your heart. And so if you would like to invite Jesus to be king over your
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:07.720]   life, we can pray now. Pray with me. Dear Father, we thank you for Jesus Christ and
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:13.920]   what He did on the cross, His death and His resurrection. And in three days He
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:22.440]   proved that He is king over death, He's king over life, He is king of truth, the
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:31.280]   king of this universe, our God, and He is a personal king. And now, Lord, I want to
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:39.080]   invite you into my life to be my Lord and Savior. Would you come into my life
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:47.000]   and make me the person you want me to be. Forgive me of my sins. In Christ's name I
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.680]   pray. Amen.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:57.320]   Bless you, KFC. And I pray that, Lord, you would take this message of our Lord's
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:03.720]   resurrection to your friends and your family as well. God bless you.
