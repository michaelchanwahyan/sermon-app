1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,380
 So, one thing I really love about Hong Kong is of course our many, many skyscrapers which

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,380
 we have here.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,680
 But what I really love is being high up in one, where you can see the view of the traffic

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,680
 down below.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,120
 You see these cars take turns and they intersect and just how all the highways and the roads

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,120
 work.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,560
 I really love watching that.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,080
 Of course, this is different to when you're in the car trying to get through the Central

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,160
 Harbour Tunnel and you're stuck behind a big bus.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,680
 I really couldn't care less about the marvel of highway infrastructure.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,600
 I don't really care about that.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,480
 All I care about is is this bus going to get out of my way so that I won't be late.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,520
 So from up top, wow, amazing, planned out, beautiful.

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,000
 But from in the car, however, this is horrible, get out of my way.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,320
 Now the contrast of these images is to me can really help us make sense of what we're

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,480
 seeing in Ecclesiastes.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,720
 As readers of the Bible, we often get that top view, that bigger picture.

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,360
 Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians, for example, to fix our eyes on what is unseen.

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,160
 We are told about eternal life, God's sovereignty over all things past, present and future in

20
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,440
 heaven and on earth.

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,920
 But in Ecclesiastes, we are in a way just stuck with this one view, stuck with that

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,440
 view of a big bus in front of us and stuck with a view of all we can see is in this life.

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,240
 The teacher, or koheleth, leans into this limited viewpoint on purpose.

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,880
 As we continue into chapter 9, there are a few things I want to make sure we take with

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,320
 us as we delve in.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,280
 It's a bit of a long premise, but really helpful in understanding what's going on.

27
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:06,060
 So firstly, koheleth, or as is often seen as the teacher or the preacher, is a character

28
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,360
 introduced by the author.

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,000
 Arguably quite self-representative, but a character nonetheless.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,800
 And so koheleth is used by the writer, and as Michelle pointed out earlier in the series,

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,640
 either Solomon himself or a Solomon-like character.

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,240
 The use of this character suggests that this is more than just a diary of personal grievances,

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:37,440
 but this is really used intentionally and as a teaching and artistic device.

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,120
 But we want to be aware of this also in heeding the advice and drawing any conclusions.

35
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,080
 The second thing, which is what I'll be spending most time on, and what I believe to be the

36
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,480
 most important aspect to understanding, is that through much of Ecclesiastes, it carries

37
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,000
 this premise of under the sun.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,040
 Our search for life and meaning is limited to being under the sun.

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,840
 He isn't really looking toward heaven and to God, but it's not denying it.

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,800
 Heavens is mentioned in chapters 3 and 5, and God himself is never really taken out

41
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,040
 of the view.

42
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:22,680
 So it's not some secular musing, but he's really looking for his meaning in this life.

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,200
 And just as he isn't pointing to heaven, he also isn't really pointing to hell.

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,240
 So it's not so much a fire and brimstone message either.

45
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:38,560
 So throughout Ecclesiastes, keeping his search for meaning and fulfilment limited to being

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,440
 under the sun.

47
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,080
 By my count, under the sun was mentioned 27 times, and then another 3 times for under

48
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
 heaven.

49
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,600
 On earth can also take this meaning in some context.

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,940
 So it's a very strong running premise throughout the book.

51
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,960
 Now the third thing is this book contains a lot of poetry.

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,120
 And as I mentioned before, there's a character.

53
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
 So it's artistic.

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,080
 Now don't get me wrong, this does not mean we just get to pick and choose whatever we

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,360
 want to take and leave the other things behind.

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,020
 It's not a buffet.

57
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:17,040
 But through imagery, the rhythm of the poetry and other literal techniques, it's better

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,240
 able to speak to the core of us, to really get to our emotion, to tell us that it gets

59
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,080
 us, it understands us.

60
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,280
 An example might be a documentary might tell us what happened in a certain situation, but

61
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,320
 often feels quite distant and unrelated to us.

62
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,260
 Whereas a TV drama where you can really delve into the characters, help us to really connect

63
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,260
 with the emotion and even see ourselves in that situation.

64
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,820
 And so fourthly, especially for us living in the post New Testament times, there is

65
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,340
 a second way which we must read this.

66
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,860
 And that is with that top view, with that bigger picture.

67
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,980
 The contrast between life and death viewed through the limitations of searching for meaning

68
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,620
 on this earth alone.

69
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,220
 And comparing that to the offering of eternal life in Jesus and living life without eternal

70
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,220
 view.

71
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,420
 Okay, so to recap quickly, Kohelet is a character.

72
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:27,260
 His search for lasting meaning, limited to being under the sun, is an artistic book and

73
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,380
 we have a bigger picture available to us.

74
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:38,360
 So apart from this book being in the Bible, why would we entertain this?

75
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,220
 It kind of seems a little bit risky, confusing, maybe even dangerous.

76
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,300
 Why bother with this book?

77
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,020
 It would have been much easier if Ecclesiastes just told us a few ways to how to live, like

78
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,380
 proverbs, something nice and simple to follow.

79
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,420
 Why would we allow ourselves to not just entertain this viewpoint, but really delving into it

80
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,580
 and getting lost in the emotion of it as well?

81
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,740
 So let's pause and think about that.

82
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,620
 We don't really need Ecclesiastes to do this.

83
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,820
 This viewpoint already is our natural disposition.

84
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,640
 Ecclesiastes just meets us where we are at.

85
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,980
 We may try to think about living for God, think about heaven and Jesus, but then we're

86
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,180
 stuck with, "Why am I in this job while that godless heathen seems to have it all

87
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,020
 and he's got it all worked out?"

88
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,660
 We are in this world, on this earth, under this sun.

89
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,960
 It's pretty hard to avoid viewing things through that lens.

90
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,660
 So while we often read about how we should live or how Paul was just able to get up and

91
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:53,860
 do so much, it can be comforting to actually see this in the Bible of all places.

92
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,500
 Real struggles of life, real existential crisis.

93
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,740
 God understands our desire to find meaning, to have an idea of what's going on.

94
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,540
 The Bible isn't just some book to look down on us and tell us what to do as many people

95
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,540
 believe.

96
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,860
 It actually understands us and what we are going through.

97
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:21,860
 And so from delving into this viewpoint, what we really want to do is come away from that

98
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:28,860
 and enrich our top view, enrich our bigger picture, our view of heaven.

99
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,660
 Just as one who doesn't know that they are a sinner doesn't believe they need saving,

100
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,680
 until we understand the futility of placing all our worth and meaning in this life alone,

101
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,160
 we don't understand the full glory of God and eternal life in Him.

102
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,680
 Reading Ecclesiastes properly could save us decades of poor decisions and living.

103
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,360
 So remember these four things as we dive in.

104
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,360
 So, alright, let's get into chapter 9.

105
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,560
 I'm sure Kohelet now is ready to get to the uplifting part of the book, so let's take

106
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,040
 a little bit of a look at the breakdown of what happens in this chapter.

107
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,600
 So 1 to 6, death comes to all.

108
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,200
 Cool, cool, cool.

109
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:20,240
 Alright, so we see the writer laying out that no matter what, death comes to all.

110
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,960
 So in verses 7 to 10, the original YOLO, which of course means you only live once, and in

111
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:36,040
 11 to 18, the teacher, or Kohelet, finishes by speaking about the importance of wisdom.

112
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,200
 So let's talk about meeting our final enemy.

113
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:47,480
 Now, we've already had 8 chapters of hearing the observations of Kohelet, and we've seen

114
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,600
 the word hevel, or hevel, come up a lot.

115
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,960
 Translated often, it's often translated to meaningless, but really has the meaning of

116
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,560
 vapour, something we can see but cannot grasp, which captures a little bit more of the idea

117
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,520
 of failing to provide any lasting meaning, rather than failing to provide any meaning

118
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
 whatsoever.

119
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:17,720
 So as a result, we have seen quite an exhaustive exercise of trying to find lasting meaning

120
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,520
 under the sun, trying to find something that won't just be hevel.

121
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,640
 Indulgence, hevel.

122
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,560
 Wisdom, hevel.

123
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,280
 Work, hevel.

124
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
 Money, hevel.

125
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
 Honour, hevel.

126
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,800
 Everything's hevel.

127
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,960
 So then after everything in this life is found to be nothing but hevel, what waits for us

128
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,080
 next?

129
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,080
 And he goes on to point out that at the end of all that, no matter how we lived, death

130
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,520
 comes to us all.

131
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,560
 So let's take a look at verse 1.

132
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,560
 But all this I lay to heart, examining it all, how the righteous and the wise and their

133
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,720
 deeds are in the hand of God.

134
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,800
 Whether it is love or hate, man does not know, both are before him.

135
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,560
 So it is laid to heart, he has examined it all.

136
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,480
 These are things deeply pondered, not just thoughts off a whim or a frustrated moan,

137
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,920
 but really considered and wrestled with.

138
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,000
 So we then see that the deeds of the righteous and the wise are in the hand of God.

139
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,040
 They are in his control and God's favour or disapproval is also under his control and

140
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,320
 command.

141
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,640
 Now from 2 to 6, Kehelet really gets into it a lot more.

142
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,880
 So let's take another look at those verses.

143
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,920
 It is the same for all, since the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to

144
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,880
 the good and the evil, to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and to him

145
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,760
 who does not sacrifice, as the good one is, so is the sinner.

146
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,340
 And he who swears is as he who shuns an oath.

147
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:05,740
 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that the same event happens to all.

148
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,200
 Also the hearts of the children of man are full of evil and madness is in their hearts

149
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,960
 while they live and after that they go to the dead.

150
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,800
 But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead

151
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,040
 lion.

152
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,120
 For the living know that they will die but the dead know nothing and they have no more

153
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,600
 reward, for the memory of them is forgotten.

154
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,720
 Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished and forever they have no

155
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,040
 more share in all that is done under the sun.

156
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,500
 So the teacher, Kehelet, really doesn't hold back here.

157
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,720
 He just spent eight chapters, however many years and however much emotional energy, trying

158
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:56,520
 to find lasting meaning in life and seems to give up now to look for that in death.

159
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,940
 All these other things I try are just hebel.

160
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,840
 Maybe the answer lies here.

161
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,840
 Maybe the answer lies actually in death.

162
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,600
 But then we see it's the same for all, the righteous and the wicked.

163
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:19,040
 So even death doesn't seem to bring any distinction or any meaning to this life under the sun.

164
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,920
 It comes to all.

165
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,360
 Now we see it comes to all and sometimes we just want to gloss over that, maybe delude

166
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,760
 ourselves or we can think about that later.

167
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,720
 But he doesn't allow you to gloss over this.

168
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,880
 He uses this poetic rhythm and also like the contrasts and opposites to make this real,

169
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
 vivid.

170
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,680
 Good and evil, righteous and wicked, clean and unclean.

171
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,120
 He may say meat eater and vegan or rich and poor or landlord and tenant.

172
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,140
 Those who think cricket is the best sport, those who are wrong.

173
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,920
 This net catches everyone.

174
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,520
 There's no loophole, no way around it.

175
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,440
 Now in verse three when he talks about this being an evil, he's really stating that this

176
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
 is sad, a sadness.

177
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:16,080
 So in their commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ogden and Zogbo, which are real names, summarise

178
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,580
 it as this.

179
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,160
 This is a terrible thing that happens in this world.

180
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,000
 Every living being shares the same fate.

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,640
 Death, what's more?

182
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,680
 People worry all their lives about this sad and distressing situation and then they too

183
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,980
 die.

184
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,200
 Now I think this really captures the heart of the issue.

185
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,360
 We can worry about, plan around or put off the idea of death.

186
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:47,160
 We stake so much of our lives on this but in the end we will all die too.

187
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,360
 And it still has the ability to surprise us.

188
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,880
 Now in verses four to six, it really is evident that the teacher is still looking under the

189
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,120
 sun for the meaning of not just life but also death.

190
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,240
 A living dog is better than a dead lion.

191
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,760
 Dogs were viewed quite differently back then.

192
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,280
 It wasn't your friendly household dog.

193
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,840
 They were somewhat despised and seen as weak.

194
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:19,200
 So it's better to be weak and alive than strong but dead.

195
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,400
 The living know they are alive but the dead know nothing.

196
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,600
 At least in living, you have hope.

197
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,600
 And there's no real sign here in these verses of looking to heaven.

198
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,440
 They shall have no more share in all that is done under the sun.

199
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,600
 So it took eight chapters to really start looking to death for lasting meaning and only

200
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,600
 six verses to make clear that it's not there either.

201
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,360
 So he searched his whole span of life, all heaven, nothing.

202
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,440
 So maybe the answer is here.

203
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,560
 Maybe the answer is death.

204
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,280
 Righteous die along with the wicked.

205
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,120
 So we're back to this better being alive.

206
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,880
 And now you have an even greater sense of sort of clinging to this period here of life.

207
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,800
 And there's perhaps some resolve and acceptance in that too.

208
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,000
 So what conclusions can we draw about death if the only meaning can be derived from what

209
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,640
 we see under the sun?

210
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,240
 Well it's inescapable, a certainty.

211
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,720
 And just as we've seen it happen to many others, it will come to us.

212
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,920
 So it's better to be alive.

213
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:40,240
 But ultimately, it kind of renders what we do on earth seemingly a bit pointless in terms

214
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,760
 of the viewpoint from having lasting meaning.

215
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,320
 I mean, doesn't that feel a bit hopeless?

216
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,840
 Actually it should.

217
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,480
 It should feel hopeless.

218
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,920
 The picture that Kohelet here is painting is for that search of meaning under the sun.

219
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,640
 And that is hopeless.

220
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,920
 We've seen in previous chapters that all the things we try to attain in life, whether it's

221
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:11,840
 money, sex, power, status, it's all heavel.

222
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,520
 It's all vapour.

223
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,060
 And now we see that not only these things, but life itself is also vapour.

224
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:27,080
 We may be lucky enough to live for 120 years, not with my diet, but this is a blip in history

225
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,680
 and how many generations before we are forgotten.

226
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,360
 Okay, let's take a breather.

227
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,880
 It feels a little bit hopeless.

228
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,240
 So let's just take, before we get too lost in that despair, remember that we do have

229
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,620
 that bigger view.

230
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,380
 We do have that bigger picture.

231
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,840
 And we've just been focusing on this limited mindset where all the place we're looking

232
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,560
 for is just under this sun on this earth.

233
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,920
 And we can remember though that we have that bigger picture of what God has done for us

234
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,720
 through his son Jesus.

235
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,360
 But we will get to more of that later.

236
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,720
 So now, whether we like it or not, let's keep our tunnel vision.

237
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,240
 So let's have a look then, how do we live?

238
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,640
 How are we supposed to enjoy this life with this hanging over our head?

239
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,400
 Well, let's take a look at the original YOLO.

240
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:26,200
 YOLO, of course, meaning you only live once, usually used before doing something stupid

241
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
 or dangerous.

242
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:33,240
 I, however, as a buzzkill, find it's much more useful for doing something safe, like

243
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,920
 check twice before crossing the road, guys.

244
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
 YOLO.

245
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,200
 Be smart.

246
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:45,100
 So now as we look at Kohelet's YOLO, we must remember that this comes just after talking

247
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:51,000
 about death and how death relates to life under the sun, not necessarily as a gateway

248
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,920
 to eternal life or to hell.

249
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,120
 So from that, we can take two conclusions.

250
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,280
 These things, though temporary, are good things, good gifts that God has given us to enjoy

251
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,840
 life.

252
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,920
 And the second, while good, these things are not to outweigh how we live in view of

253
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
 eternity.

254
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,720
 Okay, so what does Kohelet say?

255
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,600
 Always check twice for donkeys before crossing the road.

256
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,960
 No, no, no, really.

257
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,560
 Verse seven says, "Go, eat your bread with joy and drink your wine with a merry heart,

258
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,560
 for God has already approved what you do."

259
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:35,040
 And I think I've just found my new favourite Bible verse.

260
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:45,820
 So now it's a reasonable view that there's a sense of fatality in these verses just coming

261
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:51,320
 from talking about death, a sense of whatever, may as well, doesn't really matter anyway.

262
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,220
 But actually this doesn't weaken the point.

263
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,200
 If anything, it strengthens it.

264
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,200
 These are good gifts that help us to enjoy life, whether that's to help us enhance life

265
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,820
 or help us just to get through.

266
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,640
 These are good gifts.

267
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,220
 But these are not where we should try and gain our meaning, as the teacher never puts

268
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:17,860
 this forward as something to fulfill us and never encourages us to do these sins in excess.

269
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,820
 So the line, "for God has already approved what you do," can be misinterpreted.

270
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,020
 So it doesn't mean God just approves anything you may do, but more that He refers to the

271
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,060
 approval of such things as these.

272
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:37,080
 He has given them to us and expects us to enjoy life and enjoy these good gifts.

273
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,320
 So verse 8, "Always be clothed in white and always anoint your head with oil."

274
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,240
 Now I must say, very disappointed.

275
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,300
 I do not see a single oily head as I look out.

276
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,100
 But really what this refers to is what people would do for special occasions.

277
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:01,500
 So it's not literal, but it's really saying, "Live each day like it's a joyous occasion."

278
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,140
 Verse 9, "Enjoy life with your wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that

279
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,880
 He has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at

280
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,700
 which you toil under the sun."

281
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:23,120
 So I've been married now almost six months, so I think it's very fair to say that I know

282
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,140
 all things on the subject.

283
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,740
 Not sure why you're laughing at that.

284
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,920
 But this, our companionship, is another great gift from God.

285
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,340
 And often we can read our portion or our lot as a negative.

286
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,420
 It's like, "This is my portion.

287
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,420
 I'll just make do, I guess."

288
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,940
 But actually what this is really getting at is that our portion or our lot, however big

289
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,620
 or small, is a gift from God and it's for us to enjoy.

290
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,700
 And then verse 10, "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is

291
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,980
 no thought or wisdom in Sheol to which you are going."

292
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,380
 Now work is also a blessing to us as it is to others.

293
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,060
 In Genesis 2.15, Adam was acquired to work the land in the Garden of Eden.

294
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:16,900
 Now this was before the fall, so it was part of the original design.

295
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:22,200
 Colossians 3 also urges us to work willingly at whatever we do as though working for the

296
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,260
 Lord rather than for people.

297
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,140
 Now the way Kohelet ends this section is quite interesting.

298
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,860
 Just when we had thought he had gotten away from talking about death to going back to

299
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,140
 life again, he has to bring it back.

300
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:44,460
 But a reminder again that his viewpoint here is not actually looking to eternity.

301
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,260
 Blessings in life are indeed gifts and are indeed good.

302
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,060
 A blessing from God, so enjoy them.

303
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:58,900
 And I want to challenge you here to make a point to be thankful to God in all good things

304
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,140
 He has given us.

305
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,980
 Not just when we get the big job, but each day after that.

306
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,420
 Let us be thankful for the amazing experience of eating food, being with loved ones.

307
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:19,260
 Let us be truly thankful as we say grace and we thank Him for our food.

308
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:28,420
 Let us be thankful for the miracle of Gali Alamphan.

309
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:34,940
 As we posture ourselves with thankfulness to God, we can eat and drink with joy, enjoy

310
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,540
 our lives with loved ones and work with our might.

311
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:45,340
 But remember, sadly they don't hold in and of themselves the power to hold meaning or

312
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,580
 value beyond that.

313
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,500
 So there's no Michelin star restaurant that will leave us fulfilled.

314
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,360
 There's no holiday destination where all our senses will be fulfilled.

315
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:03,940
 And while my wife Mel may passionately disagree, there is no perfect spouse who can bring us

316
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,300
 lasting fulfillment.

317
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:14,420
 So the lesson here is that it's good to enjoy these things, but don't look for your life's

318
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,620
 value and meaning in them.

319
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,820
 So let's take a look at the final section, the value of wisdom.

320
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:27,020
 He then goes to tell us about a poor wise man who saves his city through wisdom.

321
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,380
 Now this is a parable rather than a recount of something that happened.

322
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,300
 So let's jump and take a look at 13 to 18.

323
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,740
 I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.

324
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,660
 There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged

325
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,100
 it, building great siege works against it.

326
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,620
 But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city.

327
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,540
 Yet no one remembered that poor man.

328
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:02,820
 But I say that wisdom is better than might, though the poor man's wisdom is despised and

329
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,580
 his words are not heard.

330
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:10,220
 The words of the wise heard in quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.

331
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:16,020
 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.

332
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:21,900
 Now the first and obvious lesson here is that wisdom is greater than might or strength,

333
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,000
 and we can extend that to other characteristics also.

334
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,500
 But remember this context we are reading this in.

335
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,220
 The wise man didn't really save anyone from death.

336
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,580
 He just maybe kicked that can down the road a little bit, or helped them enjoy life a

337
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,340
 bit more, not being under foreign rule.

338
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,660
 So why would it matter really?

339
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,020
 But it does.

340
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,860
 This is shown as a good thing, aside from the point about wisdom.

341
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:52,940
 It reinforces that even just this life and how we can enjoy it is a good gift from God,

342
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,680
 one that should be cherished.

343
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,660
 And despite sentiments we may feel Kohelet is giving throughout Ecclesiastes, he's making

344
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:07,220
 it clear here that life is indeed worth preserving.

345
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,540
 Now there are a couple of other things here that really can challenge our own hearts,

346
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,620
 and definitely did with mine.

347
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,500
 He also chooses the character of a poor wise man.

348
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,100
 Not wise because he is poor, but wise and poor.

349
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,300
 For us we may think, can those things really go together?

350
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,740
 I mean if you're so wise, wouldn't you have money?

351
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,820
 And this is a global sentiment, but perhaps exacerbated in Hong Kong.

352
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:40,380
 But we struggle to see how you could be poor and wise, maybe lower middle class, but I

353
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,900
 mean will we be able to accept the wisdom of someone who hasn't made it in this world?

354
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:53,500
 Will we be able to accept the idea of hearing wisdom from someone living on the streets?

355
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:59,520
 What do we really think is wisdom, and how much do we really value it?

356
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,300
 To further this point, even though I'm ashamed to say I probably wouldn't have listened to

357
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:08,940
 this man and would have soon forgotten him, I still find it enraging reading this, that

358
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,020
 he did not get recognised.

359
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,700
 And to me I imagine myself in that situation, I think, do you not know what I did for you?

360
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,300
 Do you not know who I am?

361
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,980
 Show me some respect.

362
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,900
 We read this and think, well what's the point of having wisdom if we don't even get any

363
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,700
 recognition for it?

364
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,900
 But actually why would that have been the goal?

365
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,220
 Trying to find meaning in some recognition of some good works.

366
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,260
 Matthew 6 verse 1 actually warns us against practising righteousness in front of others

367
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,300
 in order to be seen by them.

368
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,480
 Through his wisdom this poor man saved lives.

369
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,480
 He saved the city.

370
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,860
 This is a value of his wisdom.

371
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,580
 But we still look at him and think, poor, unrecognised, is wisdom all that great?

372
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,060
 So this is what I want us to consider.

373
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,500
 Do we really value wisdom?

374
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,060
 And what does wisdom actually mean to us if it's not something we can monetise and give

375
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,580
 a status?

376
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,420
 Do we value true godly wisdom?

377
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,980
 Okay, so what's the point to all this?

378
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,980
 What's the point to this chapter?

379
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,780
 When we read it at face value, this is what we come away with.

380
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,460
 Whether we are good or bad, we are still made alike in that we will face death.

381
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:31,580
 So enjoy what we have in life, for these are good, but they won't ultimately fulfil us.

382
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:36,320
 And while it's good to be wise, it doesn't guarantee anything and people won't remember

383
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
 you for it.

384
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,300
 All right, well thank you for joining us here this Saturday.

385
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,180
 I'm going to wrap it up there.

386
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,700
 Okay, so remember, this is the view.

387
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,160
 The one where all we can see is this bus in front of us.

388
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,700
 We can't see around it.

389
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,140
 All we can see is this life on earth.

390
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,860
 And so it seems quite bleak.

391
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,680
 There is respite, there is enjoyment.

392
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,740
 And do not mistake this.

393
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:09,260
 The fact that we get to live this life at all is a gift to us from God, not just for

394
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,540
 us Christians, but all people.

395
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,940
 But it leaves us with an emptying feeling.

396
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,300
 But we know that this isn't the whole picture.

397
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,500
 The writer himself knew this wasn't the whole picture.

398
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,380
 The part was voicing the thoughts of Kohelet, a character written by the author.

399
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:31,000
 Now remember, as we've said many times, that limitation of Ecclesiastes is looking for

400
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,820
 life with meaning under the sun, to which death comes and snatches away.

401
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:41,600
 And this bleak view makes the reality of what God has done for us so much better when we

402
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,280
 understand it.

403
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,140
 So what is that top view?

404
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,580
 What is that bigger picture?

405
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,420
 What can save us from the futility of life under the sun?

406
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:58,060
 What is going to save us from this all just being a bunch of heavel and then dying?

407
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,820
 Now us reading this in the post-New Testament times have it a bit easier than the original

408
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,220
 readers of Ecclesiastes.

409
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,900
 Also being in a Christian church might make this easier to know where we're going.

410
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,680
 But we turn to Jesus.

411
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,580
 We turn to the one who defeated death.

412
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:22,100
 The one who came from heaven to earth to take our place on the cross and forgive our sins

413
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:27,260
 so that we may not perish but have eternal life.

414
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:32,900
 Because of him we need not fear death, for then we will be home with God.

415
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:39,820
 Many of us have heard Paul say in Philippians 1.21, "For me to live is Christ and to die

416
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:40,820
 is gain."

417
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:47,540
 But a couple of verses later in elaborating, he actually says, "I am torn between the two.

418
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:54,180
 I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far."

419
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,860
 Where we are now, while a gift from God, is a broken world.

420
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,180
 But what awaits us is perfect.

421
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:07,860
 I don't think any of us are looking forward to the act of dying, but Paul is fixed on

422
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,140
 what is beyond this life.

423
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,180
 And not only does this give him hope beyond this life, it actually makes his feelings

424
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,780
 about his life here better.

425
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:22,380
 Contrast this with the summary from before where we can worry about death, diminishing

426
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,060
 our experience on earth, and we die anyway.

427
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:35,460
 Compare that with fixing our eyes on heaven and having a deeper enjoyment of life in him.

428
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,540
 Ah, but this life is hard.

429
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:45,340
 I try looking to heaven, but I'm still sad or alone or angry or jealous, frustrated.

430
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,140
 You don't get it.

431
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,700
 But God understands the struggle.

432
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,820
 This book of Ecclesiastes is exactly that and exactly what he's telling us.

433
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,900
 And it's found of all places where?

434
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,180
 In the Bible.

435
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:04,660
 So if anyone understands the frustration of a broken world, it's God.

436
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:10,620
 Where Jesus gets at, Hebrews 4.15 tells us that we do not have a high priest who is unable

437
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:16,300
 to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we

438
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,380
 are yet without sin.

439
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,860
 We don't have a God who is distant, who doesn't understand us, what life is really like on

440
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,660
 earth or what we are going through.

441
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:33,380
 He has first experience living here on earth.

442
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:39,260
 Now 4.16 tells us then to draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy

443
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,220
 and find grace to help in time of need.

444
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,580
 So this is what we must do.

445
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,940
 When we have these struggles in life, when we find the disappointment of not getting

446
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:56,620
 what we wanted or the disappointment of getting what we wanted, when we struggle to find that

447
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:59,460
 lasting meaning in this life, draw near to Jesus.

448
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:06,700
 He is the only one worthy of placing our hope in and He understands us.

449
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:11,940
 He himself was tempted and tried and shown the world and offered the world as far as

450
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,940
 the eye could see.

451
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:19,940
 But He saw the futility in this and instead chose to live for the cause of eternity, to

452
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,080
 bring salvation to you and me.

453
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,540
 And so died and was raised to life again.

454
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,740
 That we don't need to place our hope in the vapor of this world under the sun.

455
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,940
 We don't need to live chasing the things of this world, but that we may have life beyond

456
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,960
 this world and life that is perfect and everlasting.

457
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,460
 And not only that, but with His peace, we can also be more able to be content and enjoy

458
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,500
 this life on earth in all circumstances.

459
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:58,260
 So we can fix our eyes on eternal life in Him that is free from the brokenness and fleetingness

460
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,980
 of this world.

461
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:06,700
 Let us send and I implore you to draw near to Him and follow the way which He has shown

462
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
 us.

463
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,500
 Let's pray.

464
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:17,060
 Lord, we thank you that you are a God who understands us, who cares about us, who knows

465
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,260
 us deeply and understands our struggles.

466
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,980
 We thank you that you are a God who has provided a way for us to be in relationship with you

467
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,140
 and for us to have eternal life in you.

468
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:39,740
 We thank you that you came to earth to rescue us and that you pursued us in relationship,

469
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:45,700
 Lord, that we can be adopted as sons and daughters of you.

470
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,220
 And we thank you, Lord, that you show us that you get us, Lord.

471
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,340
 You show us that you understand our struggles.

472
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:59,940
 Help us, Lord, to draw near to you, to give our problems to you and to follow you, to

473
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,980
 cry out to you, to lay all we are at your feet.

474
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,460
 We thank you for who you are.

475
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,900
 In your name, amen.

476
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,900
 Thank you.
