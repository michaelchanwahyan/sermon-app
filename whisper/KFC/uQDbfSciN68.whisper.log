[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.960]   So, as John has already shared my name, so I go right into the topic.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.920]   John want me to talk about compassion to community transformation.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.280]   Some of you guys may not know what community transformation is, and I try to try to explain
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.840]   in the next 25 minutes.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.680]   May I ask how many of you ladies have been pregnant or is pregnant right now?
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.240]   Or that you have a young child at home?
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:40.280]   Okay, so just curious, for a pregnant lady with a young child, what would that woman
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.880]   should be doing?
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.840]   Last September I was shocked when I saw this on the news, and I don't know whether you
[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.960]   guys remember, a lady who was pregnant and she was trying to commit suicide.
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.040]   And the firefighters tried to rescue her, you can see she was dangling, and it's 30
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.640]   minutes away from us at Sham Shui Po.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.440]   Any of you guys remember this news?
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.680]   I was basically in tears, it's like I cannot imagine why someone who is pregnant want to
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.760]   die.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.240]   And the sad thing is when the firefighter went into her house, they also found a young
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.760]   child that is dead.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.480]   And that child, even though he's five, but his size of a two-year-old, he was totally
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.200]   malnutrition and he had bruises all over his body.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.040]   What's happening?
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.120]   If you have a Bible next to you while you're reading this news, what would the Bible have
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.400]   been telling you?
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.700]   What Bible verse would you have think of?
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.000]   And it is happening in a subdivided home.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:02.720]   There must be someone that had heard her beating her son or heard her crying in pain, in desperation.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.760]   But how come there's no help and she had to seek death?
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.480]   Do you remember in the Bible in Luke 10, 25, someone went to Jesus and said, "Teacher,
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.720]   what must I do to receive eternal life?"
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.600]   Have you thought about that?
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.560]   And Jesus said, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.000]   and love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.360]   And then what story did Jesus tell afterwards?
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.760]   The Good Samaritan.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.160]   And what's the difference between the Good Samaritan and all the Levite and the teacher
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.380]   before him?
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.720]   Jesus said he feels sorry for the person.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.480]   With the news you are reading, do you feel sorry for the lady?
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.320]   Who is your neighbor?
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.320]   Do you know your neighbor?
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.760]   Do you know your neighbor in the city?
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.480]   Well, as you all know, Hong Kong is famous for the huge gap between the rich and poor.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.920]   And basically one out of five people are living in poverty per the number.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.260]   But in reality, we have a lot of working poor.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.160]   And for us Christians, this is a great opportunity to share God's love for them.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.120]   It is a very complicated structural problem.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.540]   So for all you PhD student here, you probably understand what I'm talking about.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.200]   But to narrow it down to a very simple term, we are talking about poverty in three very
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.840]   simple level.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.200]   You hear a lot on the news about relief, giving different supplies to people, but that doesn't
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.320]   relieve the poverty problem.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.880]   We need to see transformation.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.400]   We need to help the people how to fish and not giving them the fish.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.640]   But most important, we need reform, policy changes.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.880]   I don't know what you do, but it doesn't matter what your job is.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.360]   There's something that each one of us can do because this is our city.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.520]   Well, there are four basic dimensions of poverty.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.540]   I mean, today we're just doing a simple 101.
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.040]   So when we hear about people who are poor, we think about financially poor, but at the
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.800]   same time, they're relationally poor.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.940]   They don't know who to go to.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.940]   Most of visionally poor.
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.620]   I don't know whether you have tried to help an underprivileged person before you help
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.960]   them to find a job and they don't show up for interview.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.040]   And you're just like, you cannot believe it.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.520]   Yes, we cannot believe it because we live in different world.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.560]   We live in a world that we know what's next.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.440]   We live in a world that we can anticipate.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.560]   We live in a world that has future.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.800]   They live in a world they don't know what's next.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.360]   So with the four dimension of poverty, one of the thing that we all know, they are spiritually
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   poor.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.160]   They don't have Jesus in their heart.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.400]   Let me pause for a second.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.760]   In your desperation, in your time when you are crying out, if there is no Jesus in your
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.440]   life, what would you do?
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.760]   No hope.
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:13.060]   And so church, by God's grace, we are relationally rich.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.440]   You are very blessed in this community.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.920]   If something happened to you, you know who to go to, right?
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.480]   You have your small group leader, you have Pastor John.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.960]   But when you don't have a community, when something happened to you and you don't know
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.360]   who to go to, do you know how it feels?
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.400]   In Hong Kong, there are basically six different very basic things that the poor had to deal
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.880]   with every day.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.680]   Number one is our living condition.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.840]   Do you know Hong Kong is very famous for our coffin home, our cage home, and our subdivided
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.040]   home?
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.600]   So Sarah, I don't know whether you hear about that in UK, but we are not proud of it.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.560]   It's really bad condition.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.000]   And apart from that, most of their bed had fleas on it.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.560]   Well, if you're going to be a volunteer, if I challenge you to go and visit one of those
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.280]   places, you do have to expect to bring those fleas back to your home.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.040]   Is that okay?
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.160]   It hurts sometimes to serve.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.360]   The other is food problem.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.800]   There are people actually that are starving.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:26.160]   If you actually go to some of the fast food places, we have actually with COVID seeing
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.800]   people that walk around and eating from the dishes of the leftover food.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.800]   It's really sad.
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.000]   I actually, I think this morning I saw a gentleman was just digging through the garbage bin looking
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.160]   for treasure, not garbage.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.520]   Medical problem.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.880]   When they are sick, they accept fate that they are sick.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.600]   They cannot seek medical help because they don't have the means.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.880]   They are afraid if they know what they're sick of, they will be a burden to their family.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.120]   So a lot of times they will go and seek medical advice when they are really going to send
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.880]   to the emergency room.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.600]   It is really sad.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   It is too late.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:14.440]   The other thing is they, in Hong Kong, you know, we have a very famous saying, "Soo
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.520]   zoi hei pau sin."
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.400]   Can someone translate that for me?
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.480]   Thank you.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.800]   So we can talk about that because we have a choice, but for the underprivileged, they
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.420]   don't have a choice because they are back there.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.540]   So a lot of the underprivileged family, you will be surprised.
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:40.080]   They have no money, but they will try to find every means to send their kids to tutoring
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.420]   because to them, education is the only way out.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.240]   And most of the parents, they don't even have a primary school education.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:57.880]   Think about it, when a kid during COVID, everyone is having their class, Zoom, right?
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:01.780]   A kid live in a subdivided home.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:08.760]   And now the teacher asked him to Zoom and let everybody see what's behind him.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:14.920]   And then because of COVID, these kids, they use probably the latest, not the latest, but
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.280]   the oldest technology.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.800]   They don't have free Wi-Fi at home.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.440]   They use the cards.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.520]   They don't have the means.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:25.700]   They don't have the bandwidth to get the knowledge.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.560]   And the sad thing is because the teachers are not there, they don't have anyone to ask
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.740]   for questions.
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.840]   And it is really sad.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.880]   Some of the kids in our partner churches that used to go to tutoring class, and we felt
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.560]   that they are catching up, but because of COVID, they fall right back.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.320]   At the same time, social problem and relational problem.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:54.440]   In the past, Hong Kong, a lot of the underprivileged family, they are cross-cultural marriage between
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.720]   some of the mainland gentlemen and some mainland ladies and the Hong Kong older age gentlemen.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:04.800]   The age gap, that cultural gap, it cause a lot of parenting problem.
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:10.120]   I know these things happen at your place, but in their place, it got magnified a hundred
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.960]   times.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:18.560]   But praise God, we have hope because Jesus came and died for us, and He show us to have
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.960]   mercy on earth.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.000]   And last week, John talk about compassion.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.480]   What is compassion?
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.320]   Compassion is a gift, a gift and an attitude to live by.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   You know what?
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.900]   It is a command, not a choice.
[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:40.640]   If you are a follower of Jesus, because we receive the biggest gift from Jesus, and we
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.560]   need to pass it on.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:49.240]   And Jesus know what it's like to serve the poor because He has been poor.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.240]   And I want to learn, talk to you more about compassion, because a lot of times we Christians
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.000]   say, "Oh, we are very compassionate."
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.440]   But are we?
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:05.560]   Compassion means we are willing to devote ourselves to others' difficulties and needs,
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:11.360]   getting involved in their problems, getting our hands wet, and solve them with practical
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.880]   action instead of bless you and go away.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   Compassion is not just an expression of sympathy for others.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.480]   "Oh, I'm really sorry for the person."
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.480]   No.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:28.920]   But seeing people's difficulty, being compassionate and take practical action to bring power,
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.240]   hope, and care to those people.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:39.760]   True compassion is being able and willing to devote oneself to the need of the others.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.960]   It's sacrificial.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.480]   It hurts.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:48.680]   Are you willing to be a channel of God's love and mercy?
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.800]   When was the last time you act on your compassion?
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.480]   If you do, bless you.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:04.120]   Because in the Bible it say, "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy."
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.360]   We love because God first loved us.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.520]   Isn't that powerful?
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.240]   And the reason why we're able to be merciful, because we have God's love, and that's a seal,
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:20.600]   a sign that we can go out, be His disciple.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:27.360]   And to love others and to be merciful, it is a way for us to pour out God's love back
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.920]   to those around us.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.800]   It's an act of mercy.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.420]   That is how we show the kingdom on earth.
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:44.000]   I don't know about you, but I'm a mother, so I have kids and the kids go to school.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.080]   So I have different identities.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.160]   I work.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.360]   I live in the community.
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.840]   Have you thought about the identity that God have given you means something?
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:02.320]   How can you use your identity to bless other people?
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:07.360]   When was the last time you identify someone in need around you?
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.840]   When was the last time you talk to the security guard at your building?
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.600]   Good.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:22.000]   You know, when I first came to Hong Kong, there's a security guard.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.480]   It's very uncomfortable because it looks like she is watching everything I do.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.560]   When I come home, she would tell me, "Oh, Mrs. Hoi, your kids are home now."
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.880]   I said, "Oh, thank you."
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.120]   And then, so one day, I find out everybody get off the elevator.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.680]   Actually, I don't know about you, but in my building, people don't look at each other
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.600]   when they're in the elevator.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   So I intentionally look at them and smile and say, "Good morning."
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.600]   They're like so uncomfortable.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.720]   They want to like get out as fast as they can.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.180]   And then the security guard is really nice, right?
[00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:56.320]   She will say, "Good morning," to everyone.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.760]   And everyone just knock and then walk out.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.280]   So one time, she said, "Good morning," to me, and I said, "Good morning," to her, and
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.720]   I just stopped.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.720]   And she look at me and she said, "Oh, don't you have to rush out?"
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   I say, "No.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.720]   How are you doing?"
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.960]   And she look at me and is like, "Oh, are you sure?
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.040]   Don't you have to go?"
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   And I say, "No.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   How are you doing?"
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.080]   So we started having a conversation.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:22.440]   She started telling me that her son is not doing good in school and we've become friends.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.200]   But she make it very clear, "Don't talk to me when I'm at work because I'm not supposed
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.200]   to talk to you."
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.480]   I don't know, but I guess since I talk to all the security guards, so it doesn't really
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.480]   matter because everybody knows who Mrs. Hui is.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.720]   And the beauty of it is...
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.560]   Oh, so I need to tell you this joke.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.600]   Actually, it's real.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.600]   Helena knows my daughter.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.560]   My daughter doesn't speak Chinese.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:53.120]   So when she first came to Hong Kong, she was probably like nine years old.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.200]   Because she doesn't speak Cantonese, she's afraid of the security guard because every
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.320]   time she comes back, the security guard would talk to her and she have no clue what the
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.680]   guard said.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   So one day I came back and the security guard said, "Oh, your daughter is so nice.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.520]   She gave me some seaweeds."
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.000]   I say, "No way.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.080]   She will not talk to you.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.840]   Why would she give you some seaweeds?"
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.240]   So the real story is I went home and I talked to my daughter.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.240]   I said, "What happened?
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:18.000]   The security guard was so happy that you gave her seaweed."
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.280]   And my daughter say, "No, she asked for it."
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.800]   I say, "How?"
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.280]   So apparently she was eating her seaweed and walking to the building and the security guard
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.280]   saw her.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.160]   So I try to make the story together.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.420]   Apparently she was dropping seaweed on the floor.
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:37.260]   So the security guard was pointing her seaweed to let her know she was dropping.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.660]   But my daughter thought since she was pointing at the seaweed, the security guard wants the
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.660]   seaweed.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.020]   So she gave a peg to the security guard.
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.660]   The security guard was happy and my daughter rushed into the elevator.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.980]   But you know what?
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:55.180]   That little accident bring the security guard and my daughter closer.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.460]   Now my daughter is not afraid of her anymore.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.680]   She just treat her with her snacks.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.900]   And the security guard knows my daughter...
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.100]   Will not think my daughter is rude anymore because of what happened.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:13.140]   So it's a little act of kindness that we can do to make a difference in other people's
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.820]   life.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.380]   What happens if you are an employer?
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:24.020]   How do you treat your employee with radical gratitude?
[00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.940]   That's another lecture.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.580]   Okay, I really like Henry Newman.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:36.980]   In his book, A Spirituality of Caregiving, he said that care is out of compassion.
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:43.740]   You whip with people, you cry with them, you feel how they feel, you enter into their life
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:47.920]   just like what Jesus did to us.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.500]   And by doing that, you know what happened?
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:55.280]   We are blessed because we got strengthened by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:00.020]   And we have more of Jesus in us.
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:04.660]   I'm sure by now all of you heard about shape, right, in Purpose Driven Life.
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.260]   But do you know your shape?
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.060]   Your spiritual gift, your heart, your burden?
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.740]   What people group did God put in your life?
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.980]   Your ability, what you can do or what you cannot do, your personality.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.700]   Even you are shy, you can still be a volunteer.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.460]   And what experience you have that you can bless other people.
[00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:32.460]   Well, it's important to know the shape that God has given you so you know how to be a
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:35.420]   blessing for others.
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.940]   When we talk about blessing for others, we talk about the body of Christ.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.540]   It's a community.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.620]   There's so much more we can do.
[00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:49.020]   Do you know that in Hong Kong, there are more than 1,500 churches, more than 1,500 Christian
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.540]   NGO, 800,000 Christian.
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:56.460]   Those are the ones that go to church and check the box of Christian.
[00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.940]   But there's a lot of people that believe in God, which I believe, that did not call themselves
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.940]   Christian.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.300]   They're in the church of Jesus.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:08.220]   Because we have a lot of volunteers that love people and love God, but they just don't go
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.220]   to church.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.340]   That's another thing.
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:16.820]   So we at CMP, when John talk about collaboration, we really want to collaborate with different
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:22.420]   Christian organizations because we believe as a body of Christ, we can multiply and we
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.020]   can do more for His glory.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.940]   Does any one of you guys belong to a Christian fellowship?
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:30.940]   Awesome.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.660]   Well, I know this guy called Thomas.
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.460]   I don't know whether you know him.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.820]   He's with the Association of Christian Accountants.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.460]   So one day, Thomas called me.
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.380]   She said, "Suzanna, I just had lunch."
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.380]   I said, "Good.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.680]   Wow, you know what?"
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:55.620]   He went to a cha chaan teng and he overheard two waitresses talking behind him.
[00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.420]   Waitress A was telling B, "Oh, I had a really good day yesterday."
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.860]   So waitress B said, "What happened?"
[00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:03.420]   A said, "Someone gave me a tip."
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.660]   When was the last time you gave a tip at cha chaan teng?
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.180]   Radical generosity.
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.300]   So Thomas heard that and said, "Oh, I'm a Christian, right?
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:18.140]   I'm going to make a difference for waitress A and B. I'm going to give them a big tip
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.620]   when I leave," which was what he did.
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:25.020]   So the waitresses were very happy and Thomas walked out being very fulfilled.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.420]   "Oh, I did something good for Jesus."
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:33.380]   And then as he walked back to his office in Mongkwa, which is a 10-minute walk, he realized
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.100]   there's a lot more cha chaan teng on the way.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.700]   And he was thinking, "I only blessed one cha chaan teng.
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.700]   What about the others?
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.160]   I cannot go to cha chaan teng every meal, right?"
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:51.460]   So he called me up and said, "Hey, I heard that CMP has a program called Restaurant Allowance.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.820]   Can my company join?"
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.500]   He has a small-sized CPA firm, by the way.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.380]   Okay, I'm not talking about that.
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.460]   So I said, "No, you cannot."
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.460]   He said, "Why?"
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:05.020]   I said, "Because the spirit of the restaurant coupon is the follow-up."
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:09.880]   So, okay, if you remember when the pandemic start, the government has a lot of eating
[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:14.860]   restriction for restaurant and a lot of small-sized restaurant basically go under because they
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.440]   cannot survive.
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:24.660]   At the same time, a lot of the subvention NGO that is responsible to deliver food to
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.940]   the underprivileged stopped their service because they were not sure whether it's safe
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.140]   to deliver the food to the underprivileged.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.920]   Do you remember around that first quarter?
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:40.060]   So a lot of our partner churches in the district, they sort of filled the gap.
[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.460]   Most of them, they will open the church maybe two times a week to serve the underprivileged
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:50.300]   because the mainstream of food supply vanished during that time.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.020]   So a lot of them went to our partner church and our partner church pastor called me, "Suzanna,
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.420]   do you have more food?
[00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:02.420]   We need a lot of lunch boxes and we need a lot of food for the underprivileged because
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.180]   they are flooding into our church."
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.380]   And I'm like, "I don't."
[00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.940]   At the same time, we also see a lot of restaurants that are folding.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:15.080]   So pilot project development is what we do a lot.
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:20.020]   So we say, "Okay, let's bring in a new program called Restaurant Allowance."
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:25.600]   CMP, we go raise money and then for every church, we give them $3,000.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.400]   We ask the church to go to the nearest cha chaan teng or small restaurant to work with
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:34.240]   the owner to get 100 lunch coupon, $30.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:37.820]   We don't want the cha chaan teng to go under, so it had to be a reasonable price.
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.480]   And then the church can give the coupon to the underprivileged.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.680]   So it's a win-win-win, right?
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.920]   So anyway, so I told Thomas, "You cannot do that because you are not a church.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.520]   You guys cannot do follow-up."
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.400]   So he's like, "Well," he said, "Then what should I do?"
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:56.960]   I say, "Pray about it and maybe you can go back and talk to ACA and see what they're
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.160]   willing to do."
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.280]   So he called me two weeks later and say, "Susanna, I talked to ACA.
[00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.760]   The board approve that we can...
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.160]   They will sponsor us for the program.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.840]   So they will pay for the restaurant coupon."
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   I say, "Awesome."
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.440]   But I say, "That's not enough."
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.440]   So he said, "What do you mean?"
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.960]   I said, "You know other Christian fellowships.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.480]   Why don't you find two or three more Christian fellowships?
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.920]   We can do more."
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.560]   So he did that.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.900]   And he called me back, he said, "Gosh, praise God.
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:28.240]   He got three other Christian fellowships that say yes."
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:35.380]   So with four Christian fellowships, we started the coupon allowance program for the professionals.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.040]   So what the Christian fellowship does, they will recruit volunteers to pass out the food
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:45.280]   coupon and they will raise money so we can buy from more small restaurant.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.600]   And what we do at CMP, we do the training.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:53.400]   We work with our partner churches and we recruit the underprivileged to receive those coupon.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:59.080]   And the first batch, we do it in two district, Sumtree Po and Koon Tong.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.320]   After the first batch, almost 220 people accepted Christ.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.320]   And then Thomas, okay, this is one person.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:11.720]   Because of his passion, it become something greater than he can imagine.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.360]   Batch two, we continue.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.960]   He took over, he leads.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.000]   We step back to be the consultant.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.760]   Batch three, he recruited more other partners.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.040]   He trained them.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.600]   Batch four, we went to other districts.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.200]   And then batch five, the other district churches lead.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.680]   And we continue to see that multiplying effect.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:34.160]   It all comes out from one person.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.760]   Do we have any more Thomas in this audience?
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.120]   I wish.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.640]   I wish there is a lot of Thomas.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.760]   So I just want to tell you this example, not because Thomas is really good.
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.080]   It's Thomas God is really good.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:56.960]   And Thomas feel really blessed because he get to experience the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.200]   He get to experience the abundance.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.880]   He get to see things that he cannot even imagine that will happen.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:09.600]   And when we talk about the four dimension of property, through what Thomas did, we call
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.200]   it kingdom asset-based community development.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:19.080]   A lot of times when we go to a district, we look at what are the needs in the district.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.080]   But as Christians, we look for abundance.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:22.360]   We look for God's provision.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   We look for the resources that God already placed in the district.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:32.120]   And with that, we want to have a process to be empowered by God that everyone in the community
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.720]   get to contribute.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:39.200]   We want the people in the community to grow, to learn to face and deal with their problem
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.720]   as a community, not on their own.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.840]   And the result, the person get to grow holistically.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:51.760]   And we have a saying in HKCMP, "Zhang shou zuo zhe, bin sheng zuo yin zhe," to transform
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.600]   those who need help to be helper.
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.000]   And because we believe when the underprivileged are being transformed, they will be a lot
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.400]   more effective to help those who have been in their shoes.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   Last week, you guys remember, John mentioned about the three-step for KFC International
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.080]   to get started.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.880]   I think that is very wise.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:22.080]   Stay where you are, pray for opportunity, and pursue relationship.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.160]   Oh yeah, you're right.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:26.000]   Start where you are.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Okay.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.400]   Start where you are.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.920]   Have you thought about where you can start?
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:42.920]   From your neighborhood, even from your own family, from your kids' school?
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:51.400]   So John asked me to bring some examples to the church so you guys can, at the congregation,
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.260]   you guys can find ways to get started.
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:25:05.200]   The first thing I want to suggest, we call this Love in Action gift card.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.040]   On it, it say, "Zhe si sheng, sung gup li dik lai mat."
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.320]   This is a gift from God, will bring you peace and joy.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.040]   So what we normally do is we, actually what I normally do is when I share a sermon, I
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.860]   will give it to the congregation.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:24.360]   If what I share today means something to you, and if the Holy Spirit is tugging in your
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:29.920]   heart and you have the desire to make a difference and to bless someone, carry this card in your
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:36.120]   wallet and then pray that God will bring someone that is in need will be around you.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:42.080]   I don't know who that is, but when that happens, give the card to that someone and keep praying.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.240]   If the Spirit leads for you to share the whole gospel, do it.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.040]   And if it's not ready, pray for a Bible verse that you want to use to bless the person and
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.080]   write it here and give it to the person.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.720]   And if you think the person is open, give the card and pray with the person.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.400]   Start a relationship.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.440]   That's one thing you guys can do.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:09.000]   And this card, each one of you guys will get a copy of this card with your response card.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.240]   Please don't throw it away.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.240]   Really use it.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.560]   The other one is to check out our Facebook.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.240]   On it, we have a lot of different activities.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:22.360]   Actually, you can sign up and you can join to get some experience on how to serve.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:28.240]   The other one is like, we actually have books that talk about how to serve and we have stories
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.680]   of people and churches that are making transmission in the community.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:36.120]   So it would be great, John, if we can do an all-church study.
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:39.880]   We even have a devotion session from Pastor Ola.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:44.440]   But you are really blessed because this is actually a heart from the press this week.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:49.660]   It's supposed to come last week, but we received it two days ago, so I bring a couple copies.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:51.360]   This is our latest book.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.360]   It has stories in Chinese.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.900]   And if any one of you guys are passionate enough to help us translate, we'd love that.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:02.960]   But it has 22 stories of individual churches and community and how things are being transformed.
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.640]   It's all real stories.
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.440]   And I hope you guys can read it and be encouraged.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:15.080]   The other thing is if you don't know how to start as a family, I will encourage you and
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:23.880]   your husband or wife or kids, go to Google Maps and put your home in the middle and identify
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:29.760]   the area which is within like 10 minutes walk from your home and do a one or two hour prayer
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:30.760]   walk.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.760]   As you walk and pray, you ask God to show you something that you've never seen.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.040]   See with His eyes, feel with His heart.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:45.880]   After the prayer walk, I know God will reveal to you who is your neighbor in your community.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.880]   And it's amazing.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.860]   It's amazing with those delivery.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:53.540]   And of course, I have a little booklet here.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.960]   It's called Simple Life and we partner with another churches.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.480]   It's a very simple thing.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.760]   You can do this on your own.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:05.280]   It's a one week exercise for you to deprive yourself of something like you cannot have
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.000]   Starbucks today or you cannot take a taxi.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.640]   Okay, so with the money that you save, you share with your small group and then you guys
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.520]   can pray about how to use the money.
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.640]   But the most important thing is the back, the spiritual reflection.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.320]   What did you learn or what do you experience when your life is being deprived?
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:28.600]   When you have to think about which empty out exit to get off because you don't have money
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:35.000]   in your cart or you had to get off two stop before your normal stop.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.440]   That's reality to a lot of people.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.600]   And the last one I want to share, oh, actually I have more PowerPoint.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.360]   Peace Box.
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.040]   Have any one of you guys heard about it?
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:53.560]   We do it with the Chinese side, but this is our 10th year and this is some photos I took
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:59.160]   when we have another international church that did the Peace Box and they actually 30
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.720]   people from the church, we took them to a government public estate and partnered with
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   some of our local churches to deliver a box and they were so creative.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:15.760]   Before we do the delivery, the congregation actually designed some games to play with
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.880]   the kids, so it become a half day activity.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.720]   So there's something I really want to encourage your congregation to do and I have some more
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.200]   information and some flyer.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.760]   It's basically a gift box that you take an old shoe box and we have lists of suggested
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.120]   items for the people to receive it.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.380]   You stuff the box together as a family.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.600]   You have young kids, I strongly encourage you to show them or teach them what is generosity.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:46.160]   And then on top of the box, we have a prayer card that you can write notes and bless those
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:52.780]   underprivileged and then you save it together as a congregation and you serve together.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:57.240]   The other one I want to recommend for those who can understand Chinese to join, this is
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.720]   a program, actually it was initiated by one of our partner, Dr. Siu.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.960]   Dr. Siu is a family doctor.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.600]   Any doctor here?
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.800]   Oh, we need to get more doctors here.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:15.600]   So he is a family doctor but he realized a lot of his patient need more than physical
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.300]   healing, they need holistic healing.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:24.800]   So he came to us and say he really want to do more for the patient and he also realized
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.920]   a lot of patient, a lot of people who are sick need to be visited and cared for, need
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.140]   more volunteer.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:37.640]   So he took the liberty of creating this training program that every other Friday during lunchtime,
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:42.360]   so this is for you professionals, you can Zoom and join the one hour training.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:49.840]   And every training has been very practical to share with the people and also volunteer
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.040]   opportunities.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:58.520]   So I just want to use that example as a doctor, he can, God really encourage him to do something
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.520]   like this.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.000]   So what is your profession?
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.280]   Engineer, teacher, soccer player, there is something that God can use your shape to help.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:14.560]   If you cannot think of anything, then you can join our restaurant coupon program by
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:17.520]   donating or a cup of cold water.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:22.560]   We give a $5,000 emergency relief fund for those underprivileged and by donating, you
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:27.240]   can tell us do you want to be connected to the person that are receiving your donation
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.360]   and visitation and we can make that happen.
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:37.040]   So when I first accepted Christ, there is a Bible verse that I really love that I want
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.700]   to share with you.
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.280]   And it's in Matthew 25.
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:48.600]   In my dream, I wished one day when I die, I get to the gates of heaven and Jesus will
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.040]   look at me and say, "Good and faithful servant."
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:56.640]   But you know when I talk to different people, people give me different interpretation of
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.340]   what is good and what is faithful.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:05.200]   So after working at CMP for the last 11 years, I sort of figure out my own definition.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.700]   Is to manage the talent and the resources that God gave me.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.080]   Be a good steward.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.480]   Hong Kong has a huge gap between the rich and poor and for most of us who are sitting
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.560]   here, we are the ones that are resourceful.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:25.560]   How can we use the resources that God put on our management to multiply for his glory?
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.360]   Good in a sense, being helpful and doing the will of God.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:37.080]   I don't know what God's will is for you, but I can guarantee when you serve others, you
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.760]   will receive the blessing of giving.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.040]   Thank you.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:46.040]   [Applause]
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:56.040]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
